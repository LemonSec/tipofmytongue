1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,720
good morning everyone

2
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:37,420
this is the best competition element

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:40,179
working group session so yeah that's why

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,429
we still use well not well we're cells

5
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:45,100
they're already so even if you come are

6
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:48,999
supposed to be aware of the IPR policy

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,649
within the ETF you supposed to be aware

8
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:53,049
of that even when you subscribe and

9
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:56,409
restart to the unit of meeting so please

10
00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:00,249
take some time to be aware of the wounds

11
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:05,440
on make sure you abide by them when you

12
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:07,360
contribute to the hf so usual stuff the

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,610
blue sheet should be running across the

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,860
room make sure you have signed them down

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,990
before during the meeting it helps us to

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,110
track the number of attendees and make

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,810
sure whether problem for next meeting

18
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:26,080
and can accommodate every attendees need

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:31,720
it Howie taking the minutes thank you

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:35,950
Harish we also have you nothing golf

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:39,070
connected to trouble parental please

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,310
make sure that you come to the mic on

23
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,139
the pink cross make sure when you have

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,470
question to you the mic because we have

25
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:54,430
streaming we are recording so everything

26
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:56,560
should be hold by the mics and make sure

27
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,630
you everyone can understand what you say

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,370
remember to stay tuned and when you come

29
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,619
at the mic also this is your football

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,829
sore hari taking the minutes and people

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:08,679
remote especially

32
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,769
we have people attending remotely by the

33
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,680
way one of them will be presenting later

34
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:19,480
so this is not just Siri there are

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:23,470
people connected from remote so how I

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,459
said before how he has been appointed as

37
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:31,000
the PCE working group secretary so

38
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:35,940
thanks again Harry for agreeing to take

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,220
that position Harry M is to among us

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:44,440
they succeeded in helping flush the

41
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,130
backlog of the PC document on other

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,579
stuff PC working group so thank you for

43
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,239
the help agree on it's likely that it's

44
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:59,160
your last meeting as a PCE co-chair so

45
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:05,799
thanks a lot thank you for everything

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:10,780
work I danced everything and the terms

47
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,650
from beyond the castle thank you

48
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,160
[Applause]

49
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,569
hopefully we keep seeing you here

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,160
[Music]

51
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:25,510
the meaning is as usual the many

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,970
documents that will be presented here

53
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,010
that haven't been discussed on the list

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,720
yet this is a pity you don't have to

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,720
wait for a presentation to trigger

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,930
discussion on the list many things can

57
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,549
happen between the meetings so the list

58
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:46,420
is open 24/7 please keep on trying

59
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:49,569
triggering discussion there that's a way

60
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:55,000
to make it all progress even between the

61
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:56,708
meetings so it's very useful to force

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,840
yourself to trigger discussion over

63
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,319
there because that's one of the tools on

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,450
the PC working we'll probably under use

65
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,319
that tool the week

66
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:13,970
it's been a while that we've been set up

67
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:18,159
that week in place seconds so correctly

68
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:21,980
up-to-date and it allows us to track

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,410
various cues for document adoption in

70
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,290
the walk you noob walking with Blasco

71
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,000
[Music]

72
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,940
sharing responsibilities and so on so

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,740
this is useful tool you may be

74
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,230
interesting also to bring in your a test

75
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,570
there if it makes sense it's open to

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,270
anyone with an account so if you feel

77
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:47,120
something isn't accurate you may also

78
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:51,260
add from there the link is included as

79
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,450
right so have a look at it it's useful

80
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,590
info that goes beyond what the data

81
00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:02,349
tracker is already providing so feel

82
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,349
free to look at and maybe comment

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,400
implementation policy so we've been

84
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:13,270
already talking about that on the list

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,120
as you should be aware of

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,969
it is required that the working group

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,260
define an implementation policy for the

88
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:28,990
world they are defining and specifying

89
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:33,789
so in the PC working group we've decided

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:36,400
that we should abide by this rule by

91
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:41,320
including an implementation status

92
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,770
section in each document so unless

93
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,010
specific reason to be discussed means

94
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,130
the the chair is identified we expect

95
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,880
that all PC document include that kind

96
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,520
of section and it is especially true for

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,570
document occur close to the walk-in

98
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,310
Blasco be aware that we won't start

99
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,440
working with last goal without

100
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,310
addressing this issue it's been already

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,940
pointed out on the list review them in

102
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,919
this situation so this will be a

103
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,469
breaking point starting from now which

104
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,960
is already a breaking point

105
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,880
so please update your document we

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,070
through this section it doesn't have to

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,200
include a lot of things if there are few

108
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,330
things to do but the section must be

109
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,400
there I'm not empty of course so the

110
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:43,979
agenda has been shown for a while also

111
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:47,620
no major change note which is scheduled

112
00:06:43,979 --> 00:07:08,469
anyone wants to bash anything in the

113
00:06:47,620 --> 00:07:11,260
agenda okay we we've been as Jillian

114
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,870
said we've been working quite hard to

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,300
push the backlog out of the working

116
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,849
group and the result of that is we've

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,969
now got a lot of documents that are

118
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:26,889
beyond the working group since Park two

119
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:29,530
of them came out as RSC's the ability

120
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:33,729
to actn and the state for

121
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:36,400
point-to-multipoint both of which have

122
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:38,050
been a little while in the in the

123
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,210
production so I thought but it's good to

124
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:46,900
have them out then we've got three more

125
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:50,590
that are in the RFC editor queue so

126
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,250
they're shortly to become RFC's the

127
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:57,729
first of those the segment routine

128
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:01,889
document is part of cluster 340 a

129
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:05,169
cluster is a a group of mutually

130
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:07,509
dependent documents that need to be

131
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,930
progressed through the RFC editor as a

132
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:13,180
block I believe that all of those

133
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,689
documents are now with the RFC editor

134
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:23,800
and and 340 is going to come out soon so

135
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:28,389
that RFC will come the second one w son

136
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,009
RW a is dependent on the gmpls document

137
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:34,810
that's just a little lower down on the

138
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:40,930
slide so that's all okay and hierarchy

139
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:45,550
extensions are in with the authors to

140
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:51,310
make some comments back to the DRC

141
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:54,519
editor John and Laura lo Anderson since

142
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,459
MPLS also had at least one document in

143
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:01,680
that cluster 340 I have talked to the

144
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:04,719
RSC editor and they say that this

145
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,979
publication of all those drafts are six

146
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,410
to eight weeks out oh well okay thank

147
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,910
you I guess that means the the cluster

148
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:19,180
is fooled out that they haven't edited

149
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:24,589
yet yeah okay

150
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:26,540
two documents are with the ASG they're

151
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,070
both actually really sort of back with

152
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,079
the authors after iesg review and

153
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,259
pending updates I think if there's no

154
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:39,290
well updates they need to make but if

155
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,630
any of the author's is confused please

156
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,579
talk to the chairs and the Shepherd to

157
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:48,529
move that forward and then we've got

158
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:52,969
we've we've scared

159
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:55,399
our ad which is quite fun because part

160
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,160
of this moving the backlog means we've

161
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:02,600
suddenly pushed rather a lot of

162
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:05,810
documents through there are now six in

163
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:10,610
various states with with the ad with the

164
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,829
ASG I don't think I need to go through

165
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,120
them all but they're in various states

166
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:18,500
from needing updates after history

167
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,620
discussion all the way through to

168
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:26,569
pending a review from the area

169
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:29,230
Directorate so quite a range we've got

170
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:34,250
two early Copeland allocations that

171
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:37,610
looking quite safe they expire later

172
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,760
this year but they're both progressing

173
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,910
through the publication so we don't

174
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:54,420
expect any challenges there and we have

175
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:56,550
no errata in hand so now

176
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,979
since they were working with documents

177
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,709
on the agenda none of the authors asked

178
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,019
for agenda slot but I thought we should

179
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,609
put that and let's discuss our working

180
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,130
with buttons that because those are the

181
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,560
most important charted work that we have

182
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,829
already agreed to progress on so let's

183
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,170
go through their status predict WA T we

184
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,329
have some documents which the authors in

185
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,819
the past have claimed that there are

186
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,310
nearing working group last call and as

187
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,680
Julian mentioned the main gating point

188
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,719
where they are stuck is the

189
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,810
implementation policy that as a working

190
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,910
group you all have agreed to and please

191
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,040
talk to us regarding how to progress

192
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,139
this since maybe this is the first time

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,670
you are adding this so is there any

194
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,740
questions we are here to help you out

195
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,769
and some of the documents have already

196
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,500
added so you can also refer those

197
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:50,459
documents on the amount of detail note

198
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,589
that that this is your this doesn't mean

199
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,689
that you must have an implementation it

200
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:57,980
just means that you must talk about it

201
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,910
in the document and even if you have

202
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,829
implementations that are coming or you

203
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,709
don't plan to you can put that

204
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:06,750
information as well in the dis section

205
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,969
so start talking about it and then we

206
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,310
can start progressing these documents

207
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,339
the last document in the set is the

208
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:18,029
gmpls document that got merged during

209
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,130
the last last meeting a refresh was

210
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,320
promised which is still pending which

211
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,720
was supposed to deal with more editorial

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,220
changes so once that is done I think

213
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,079
this document is also nearing working

214
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,890
your plus call and I think surfer wants

215
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,579
to say something

216
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:38,519
yeah just any agree with the money if

217
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:42,660
you need anything both this am available

218
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:46,010
for helping with their document okay so

219
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,149
now one document which got updated so

220
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,060
let's look at the status of that

221
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,430
document which is our PCP and one

222
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,359
technical change was with respect to key

223
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:59,550
where LSP ID key also got added into the

224
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,730
LSP dB this is useful and make before

225
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,519
break cases where the you may have for a

226
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,770
temporary multiple LS B's so using the

227
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,660
LSP ID as a key

228
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,910
is helpful so based on that comment this

229
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,310
change was done and rest of the all the

230
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,579
comments are related to the RFC style

231
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,729
guide and how to properly use the

232
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,680
references or droughts and etc which

233
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,800
were discussed on the list and all those

234
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,329
things have been done as a status the

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,449
early young doctor review of this

236
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:33,090
document is also done but we do not have

237
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:36,030
any implementations of this young model

238
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,520
yet so if you are aware of this or are

239
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,680
you planning to implement please reach

240
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,110
out to the authors or on the list or the

241
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,449
chairs so that's about the yang model

242
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:52,410
some other documents which are not yet

243
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:56,580
fully cooked but but we need to discuss

244
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,130
one is the PCC see the PCC C document we

245
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,220
did Maidan of the update was made and it

246
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:05,090
was posted and they have added the

247
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,040
implementation status discussing about

248
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:11,640
what's what's implemented with respect

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,660
to PCC see the second document is the

250
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,490
native IP this was presented last time

251
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,949
there is no update and I think mostly

252
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,170
dependent on the movement that we see in

253
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,500
the t's working group of the related

254
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,810
documents we have the LSP scheduling

255
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,740
refresh was made but more technical

256
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,650
changes again I think implementation of

257
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,210
this document is something that the

258
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,340
authors would like so if you have plans

259
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,830
for implementing this please teach out

260
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,140
to the working group to documents which

261
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,850
were recently adopted or the flex grid

262
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:50,250
and the SRV six supporting piece up and

263
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:53,310
the one document that we wanted to

264
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:57,210
explicitly discuss was the enhanced

265
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:59,699
errors this was an agenda in IT f-104

266
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,010
and it was presented after that we

267
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:06,000
decided that there should be a guideline

268
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:09,510
of all the future documents how they can

269
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,640
use the enhanced errors and notification

270
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,490
so the guideline is as you can see in

271
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,560
the slide it requests that any new

272
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,870
document if they are defining new error

273
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,760
type or notification they should think

274
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,890
about whether this

275
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,900
error needs to be propagated in multiple

276
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,620
domains and what kind of error

277
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:31,800
criticality condition they should refer

278
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,900
so this is the die line that at least on

279
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,370
the mailing list who kind was agreed on

280
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,660
so if you have any thoughts on this

281
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,160
guideline still reach out to us and we

282
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,540
plan to either put this guideline on

283
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,209
wiki or in the draft itself or both and

284
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,740
the request would be that let's since

285
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,900
this is our working of document and if

286
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,420
we have consensus on this let's start

287
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,110
making sure that all the documents which

288
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:02,130
define new errors also refer to the

289
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:07,590
enhanced error techniques available any

290
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:10,860
comments on this good okay so the last

291
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,750
slide from the status we know that you

292
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,850
care about your documents and you may be

293
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,280
asking chairs that when the adoption

294
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,820
thing would happen we have a little bit

295
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:24,180
of a queue happening here it's a pretty

296
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:27,360
long Hugh wastes will slowly get to it

297
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,579
our first focus was to get the working

298
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,070
group LCQ happen and as you can see

299
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,890
that's empty for us now but now we have

300
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,470
a little bit like a no backlog at the

301
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,900
adoption whole thing so your chairs are

302
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,060
aware of it and we will get on this and

303
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,430
in fact the adoption pole for the first

304
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,410
document is ongoing now I ask from you

305
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,140
would be that we would need to hear from

306
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,990
you that it's we're not just doing this

307
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,400
poll for for the sake of it we want to

308
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,490
help whether the working group is

309
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,640
interested in it you can always say that

310
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,110
you are not it's doesn't have to be just

311
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,810
support it's your choice of saying that

312
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,400
no this should not be adopted and the

313
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,290
working group effort will waste it while

314
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,420
working on this document so but please

315
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,270
speak out the silence doesn't give us

316
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,370
the clear indicator on dodging the

317
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,980
interest in the working group for

318
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:20,639
various items

319
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:25,020
rakesh from Cisco the PC path segment

320
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:28,230
has both SR MPLS as well as SR v6 path

321
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,660
segment right now right the the MPLS is

322
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,510
a working group document but the survey

323
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,530
6 is not so I think maybe we need to

324
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,250
sort that out for

325
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:42,720
before we have adoption call for the PC

326
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:45,870
part segment should discuss with among

327
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,730
the authors and come back to us yes we

328
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:52,439
already did okay so wiki's open when you

329
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,730
make some decisions and you want to

330
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,210
remove the document from the adoption

331
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,590
pool cue and go back and work on it or

332
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,270
whatever decision that you make come

333
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,889
back to us and let's keep the wiki up to

334
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,170
date so that all in the working group

335
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,960
are aware of what's happening when

336
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:12,320
daughters okay thank you

337
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,320
let's start with the first presentation

338
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,110
the first presentation is Mike so if I'm

339
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,590
not mistaking Mike it's a presentation

340
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:47,429
to the PC working group welcome on among

341
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:48,570
us so my name is Mike Koehler chef and

342
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,490
presenting on

343
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:56,669
I'm from Cisco presenting on behalf of

344
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:59,820
the authors so the purpose of this draft

345
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,700
is to clarify stateful piece a behavior

346
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,280
that would leave less room for

347
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:09,750
misinterpreting certain things and we

348
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:15,600
compiled it as a result of basically ent

349
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:17,880
C Interop exercise so the main kind of

350
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,340
thing that we're doing is we're trying

351
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,460
to clarify the meaning of what the state

352
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,230
mean instead for piece up and how do you

353
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,290
exactly manipulate the state how you

354
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:31,140
maintain it and so we introduced these

355
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,960
two databases the LSP database and the

356
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,160
Association database so these are both

357
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,440
stored on both the PCC and the PC and

358
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,840
they have identical structure on the PCC

359
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,840
on the PC and one thing we

360
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,750
do is we update the RFC a23 one by

361
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:55,139
saying that PC request is not mandatory

362
00:19:49,750 --> 00:20:01,060
for the PCC to send so this simple files

363
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:03,760
basically OSP bring out so first we

364
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,190
introduce this LSP database so we kind

365
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:12,430
of have these five basic rules about

366
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:16,720
what it is and so on the PCC the LSP

367
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:18,820
database is modified kind of pretty much

368
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,340
continuously by the PCC whenever it

369
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:29,230
whenever it decides to signal a new path

370
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:31,959
so and then on the PC the LSP DB is only

371
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,150
modified by PC report messages so there

372
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,450
is no other way that the PC can modify

373
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,250
its house be done please and we also

374
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,620
clarify that there is a two-tier

375
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,620
structure to this database in that there

376
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:49,830
is something called a tunnel and the

377
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:51,909
Stono is a container for our species and

378
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,520
so the tunnel is the thing that's

379
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,230
identified by the POS PID and the

380
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,650
symbolic name and there was is

381
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,780
identified by the RSP identifier and I

382
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,840
just want to note that basically these

383
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,750
this wording of tunnel and LSD is up for

384
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,230
discussion so SP stands for label

385
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:16,570
switched paths but this applies to non

386
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,060
labeled protocols and so perhaps saying

387
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:27,310
path database is a better choice instead

388
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:31,600
of LSP database so and we also introduce

389
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:34,500
this association database so this one

390
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,419
has is more it can be updated kind of

391
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:42,880
both by messages and configuration on

392
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:44,500
both the PCC and the PC and so each we

393
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,110
we kind of say that each a so is a

394
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,350
container for LS B's it's not a

395
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,879
container of tunnels so because if we

396
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,389
try to make it a container of tunnels

397
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,580
then it's not possible to do a make

398
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,870
before break

399
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:04,210
from one association to another because

400
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,489
you can't say that you my re-up tell us

401
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:12,610
P is in a different Association the

402
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:14,980
current house and last is the the change

403
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,169
we're proposing to RFC eight to three

404
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:21,460
one which states that PC request is not

405
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:23,530
mandatory because basically the PC you

406
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,060
cannot really enforce this so we found

407
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:32,680
that even if you don't send this request

408
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:35,320
the PC the PC will still you will still

409
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,960
react to your PC report just as well so

410
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,669
it basically saves one message during

411
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,850
state for bringing up or two messages

412
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,980
doing stateful bring up so I think

413
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,870
that's a good thing

414
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,600
and this is the end of my presentation

415
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,709
so every one of these time for questions

416
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,709
[Music]

417
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,970
okay sorry in a hallway sorry future Lea

418
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:13,930
okay so one thing that simple comment if

419
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,870
you want to have a different name for

420
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,790
LSP I would suggest connection I always

421
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:23,820
like this better than LSP for the

422
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:26,409
reasons you just described okay and

423
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,679
basically it is also better than path

424
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,450
because but you would confuse passes

425
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,300
computed paths which are not provisioned

426
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:42,280
so allow the connection database would

427
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:45,060
be a better term okay so this is more

428
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,590
firm I guess a question for the group

429
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,600
was like understand Nokia I think this

430
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,100
is more of a question for the group

431
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,840
we're diving board point to the fact

432
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,550
that PC request is not supposed to

433
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,020
modify state there are maybe

434
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,480
implementations out there today which

435
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,220
are doing reservation with given of

436
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,530
course if it's a PC request you might

437
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,700
not expect a report coming back so there

438
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,260
could be time of mechanisms and other

439
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,910
implementations to still hold

440
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,129
reservations primarily in the use case

441
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,850
of bandwidth so I'm wondering as a group

442
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,269
is that statement

443
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,639
that PC request is is shall not you know

444
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:18,169
modify the LSPD

445
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:19,969
LSP DB is that something that should be

446
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,889
a may or is that too restrictive

447
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,889
or do we generally think that that's a

448
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:29,258
silly idea it's no question for the

449
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:29,258
group thanks

450
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:37,039
hi this is Adrienne as a as an

451
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,409
individual it's three things and be

452
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:44,830
really careful about specifying the

453
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:48,940
format of databases in implementations

454
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:52,668
that makes no difference to

455
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,700
interoperability and what we do as

456
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:57,799
protocols for the wire so I only and say

457
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,009
what state what information needs to be

458
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,918
stored about how it's stored is up to

459
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:08,269
your competitors to screw up you want to

460
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:14,590
encourage them to screw it up second

461
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:17,720
point which was kind of just made I

462
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,418
think it's too strong to say a PC is not

463
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,029
supposed to create any state a piece he

464
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:25,399
probably doesn't need to but there's

465
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:28,669
this kind of concept of sticking state

466
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:31,059
where you you make a request and you

467
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:33,620
don't know whether the networks going to

468
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:37,399
use that information but you kind of

469
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:40,699
want to get ahead of the IGP just in

470
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:44,719
case they do so think about that and the

471
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:50,830
third one was 82 31 updates I've got

472
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:56,240
this little draft clarifying the use of

473
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:57,918
bits if we're gonna make 82 31 updates

474
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,220
we should think about whether we bundle

475
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,070
them together or not yeah I just want to

476
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,250
quickly just say about the peace request

477
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:10,399
not modifying the LSP TV so I think

478
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,279
there may be a use case where you kind

479
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:17,000
of use the PC for OAM so say you want to

480
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,730
ping like an inter domain path right and

481
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,370
you just want to basically say you know

482
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,990
give me some path right but you don't

483
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,290
want to touch the network you don't want

484
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,170
to

485
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:31,100
modify any state in the network based on

486
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,020
that like you just it's it's like you

487
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,750
know you just want to probe the network

488
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,360
right you don't want to modify it so I

489
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,100
think that's why I mean that we said

490
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,070
that but we're kind of open to whatever

491
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,730
the workgroup says they're Hilah burger

492
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,770
I agree with Adrienne's point about the

493
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:53,050
databases you don't want to specify them

494
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:57,520
as formal requirements but as a

495
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:59,960
conceptual talking point as a way of

496
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,610
characterizing the information that's

497
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,280
being stored I think that's really

498
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:08,330
useful it's good to have some common

499
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,280
terminology so I actually like that and

500
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:15,260
just don't make it that you actually

501
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:18,500
have to build it that way the have you

502
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,810
thought about protection paths and now

503
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,640
you're gonna represent them protection

504
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,580
yeah I mean there's just the association

505
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,600
objective well you can there's there's

506
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,980
different ways to model if you're

507
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,010
thinking about it from a database

508
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,930
representation and you could choose just

509
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,700
to leave them uncorrelated and then you

510
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:37,150
have to walk the whole database to find

511
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,740
the Association you know which ones are

512
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:44,150
associated or you might do some formal

513
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:46,640
linkages okay I would say if you could

514
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:50,390
write down on the mailing list in more

515
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,560
detail than I think we can it's really

516
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,750
just think about how you want to

517
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,850
represent that so it's it's usable

518
00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:01,520
information okay cool one thing though

519
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:03,919
about the the database I think we should

520
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,900
specify the key of the database right

521
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,230
because like if different vendors use

522
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,970
like if one vendor uses the LSP ID as

523
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,160
the key and another vendor uses the

524
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,230
tunnel ideas the key like you end up

525
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,210
with a broken you know they're not gonna

526
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,560
interrupt and then nobody wins in that

527
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,570
situation so I'd say that's an

528
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,330
appropriate thing to think about if you

529
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,600
are defining data models like yang

530
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,350
models if you're talking about just sort

531
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:33,230
of informative concepts it's fine to say

532
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,790
that you think of it that way I don't

533
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,680
think you can specify it if you want to

534
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,060
specify it I think you have to end up

535
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,980
with some foremost

536
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:45,679
Asian language which we end up with

537
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:48,470
doing yang I mean okay as you know

538
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,060
Adrienne pointed out we defined behavior

539
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:55,150
on the wire we don't be a defined

540
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:58,149
behavior inside the node all right

541
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,150
thanks

542
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,550
eatle woozy from away I have a question

543
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,530
for radiation you say that in the

544
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,889
Association is not between tunnels but

545
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:12,080
in teas we are modeling in Titan and

546
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:15,980
modern association between Tennyson and

547
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,240
be confusing is the limit so yeah just

548
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,760
trying to understand why we have

549
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,650
different viewpoints on different

550
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,690
working groups right so this is

551
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:29,360
basically you can have association

552
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,610
between tunnels if every I was peeing in

553
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,010
in tano is associated to every RSP and

554
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:37,189
tunnel B then the two tunnels are

555
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,740
associated but making it purl SP it

556
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,330
gives some more use cases such as if

557
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:46,160
you're doing bi-directional for example

558
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:48,800
then the two LS B's there may be you

559
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,380
know a real plus B which is associated

560
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,300
to the real optimist be on the other end

561
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,650
it's not associated to the current of us

562
00:29:53,300 --> 00:30:01,520
B on the other end so services agent

563
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:05,210
again I think we have a disconnect on

564
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,330
terminology that when you're down in the

565
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,610
transport world a there's a double

566
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,340
disconnect on terminology and not not

567
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,449
the layer 4 transport the lion transport

568
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,699
when you're down in the late in the

569
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:22,570
underlying transport world a tunnel is a

570
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:25,790
pipe in rsvp-te world a tunnel is this

571
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:30,350
conceptual collection of potential

572
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:36,070
connections we call LSPs right so it

573
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:36,070
tells term tunnel is your turn LSP

574
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,940
my definition of tunnel is very simple

575
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,510
it's just the thing identified by the

576
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,520
POS PID so your point is that the LS PB

577
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,800
did the association between tan s is

578
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,889
model as association between all y LS PB

579
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:59,010
on the Tumnus that's the way you address

580
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:00,590
that yeah you can you can solve like in

581
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:04,020
some cases it doesn't make sense to have

582
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:06,389
association between individual LS B's in

583
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,220
that case you just associate the tunnels

584
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,950
by associating you know there are space

585
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,290
yeah yeah I'm not saying it indeed you

586
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,870
can associate an S in that then you can

587
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:20,760
do that by using all yellow speed or or

588
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:24,120
not I'm confused so basically just a

589
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,070
clarification when we model T tunnel we

590
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,840
basically saying that Alice piece that

591
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,550
go on to the same tunnel like walking

592
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,639
and protection Alice B's they do not

593
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,500
meet any association they already I

594
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,630
children of this tunnel and associated

595
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,700
native lives for that when we say

596
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,670
associated tunnels it means that there

597
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,800
are tunnels basically all their

598
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,050
connections or only working connections

599
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,360
it doesn't matter but for example there

600
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,879
is an association one supports one

601
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,129
direction in data plane and another in

602
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,970
opposite direction and so forth this is

603
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,620
like a higher level of Association so

604
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,180
basically putting everything into

605
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,429
connection Association or I lost

606
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,350
association it's actually confuses a lot

607
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,600
of things

608
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,790
okay so again

609
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,909
LSPs that belong to the same tunnel they

610
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,230
associated by definition their

611
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:16,410
association object the tunnel ideas

612
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,630
association object yeah and we're not

613
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,490
trying to associate two osp's within the

614
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:23,940
same tunnel typically that there's no

615
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,770
use case for that associate a las peace

616
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,960
between themselves because they belong

617
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,820
to different tunnels okay they just

618
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,370
unprotect the tunnels if they have a

619
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,290
single LSP I'm not sure you said them do

620
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,290
your previous thing that we're somehow I

621
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,540
mean it's not necessary to to associate

622
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,520
LSP is among it within the same tunnel

623
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,550
and I'm saying I agree with you there

624
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,440
and but but you do need to associate

625
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,050
tunnels basically as parents or

626
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,610
sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah and

627
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,360
there are different reasons why you do

628
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,129
that

629
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,379
you do not associate them on the less P

630
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,450
level that's what I'm saying your

631
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,130
associated okay you can bring that up a

632
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,399
new in the meaningless and we can think

633
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:08,039
of a solution thanks tarick from

634
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,110
Jennifer I might all right so about the

635
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,120
Association itself I just want to

636
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,370
clarify you can have multiple types of

637
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,110
Association right there's diversity

638
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:21,178
there's carotid Ness you're so cold out

639
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,899
goodness is one example where you want

640
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:28,010
the LSPs of the same tunnel or possibly

641
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:31,979
forward and reverse to be associated

642
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:35,639
right right I don't think we should

643
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,490
dictate that you cannot do it per tunnel

644
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,178
or you cannot I mean LSP granularity is

645
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,789
fine by me

646
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,279
which is the fine granularity but one

647
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,260
can choose to do it on per tunnel and in

648
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,299
fact you know if you have diversity you

649
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,158
want to always be you know this tunnel

650
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,500
is diverse from this tunnel no matter if

651
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,450
you do make before break or not so my

652
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,570
comment is not to go technical but I

653
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,789
think dictating it raises the concern

654
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,350
but if not fair enough I don't see what

655
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:04,220
you're saying so okay thanks

656
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:08,339
maybe we can go just out there Thanks

657
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,470
yes I think the Association is for LSP

658
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:12,418
but is the recipes can be across the

659
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:15,689
different tunnels so that's how is

660
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:18,239
modeling T's as well so I think what

661
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,990
you're saying terminology wise it kind

662
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,379
of makes sense

663
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:27,449
okay thanks rubbish yeah I think there

664
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:29,368
is maybe maybe this this rule it's the

665
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,259
also as a continuum for ESPYs maybe

666
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:34,169
that's left up to the individual also

667
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:38,129
definition then I think a more generic

668
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:40,020
way yeah thanks Mike Mike as you

669
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:42,598
progress this work on I think a

670
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,219
suggestion that I would give you for

671
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,950
this like you know right now it's a mix

672
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:49,138
of clarifying things mix off making

673
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:50,879
changes into RFC eight two three one so

674
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,770
we need to scope it a little bit better

675
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,690
and maybe the things that needs to

676
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,390
update eight to three one work with

677
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,280
Adrian and we we scope it as a standard

678
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,799
strat thing and the things which are

679
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,480
clarifying there we and again when you

680
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,490
are clarifying I think currently you

681
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,070
clarify from the database point of view

682
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,890
and you think of what is the database at

683
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:13,080
see see what is the database at PCE but

684
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,790
in ITF and in we should worry about

685
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,980
what's on the wire so if there is any

686
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,440
confusion between what people are

687
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,720
encoding in LSP identify TLD or people

688
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,250
are making mistakes with symbolic paths

689
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,250
name and some correction needed there

690
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,830
that is more important than how does an

691
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,930
implementation stores the information

692
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:34,500
the same thing with a SOG DB whether I

693
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,240
create a DB or I it's a state in my LSP

694
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,210
DB itself why does it matter

695
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,279
let that be up to the implementations to

696
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,140
figure out I agree with you that you

697
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,190
know we should I understand okay

698
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,560
ideally that we should be concerned

699
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,450
about protocol on the wire stuff however

700
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,520
in this case what Mike is trying to do

701
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,589
here is clarify interpretation of those

702
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,420
values on the wire so during in araba

703
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,500
ran into that where the meaning of a

704
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,480
certain number of the meaning of a

705
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,890
certain name or the expectation of a

706
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,420
certain name or number to exist or not

707
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,910
exist and how it was used

708
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,910
there was differences of opinion there

709
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,799
and I agree so instead of showing it as

710
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,560
a data base at rest we should show

711
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,120
what's the message that the require the

712
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,759
report message or update message should

713
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,609
include so my kind of comment to that is

714
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,690
it it doesn't matter what the message is

715
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:24,600
so I mean okay maybe we are interrupting

716
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,860
message is more important so for example

717
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,040
what I'm saying here in the first point

718
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,800
is that the PCC DB is mod of PCC LSP DB

719
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,450
is modified by any trigger it could be

720
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,140
PCI update there could be a local

721
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,759
computation it could be configuration so

722
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,560
regardless of what triggered it like I

723
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,960
don't need to specify it you know the

724
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,440
same thing 3 the same rule 3 times I'm

725
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,420
just saying that basically it's the the

726
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,400
tribulus common and you know your state

727
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:56,970
changes in one way so we can discuss

728
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:58,590
that on the mailing list I think so I

729
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,779
this useful work I mean we've had

730
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,640
various implementations interpret things

731
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,640
different ways so I think is really

732
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,410
useful if you're going to add some

733
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,970
recommendations for what the Association

734
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,870
DB needs to look like and proposed

735
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,339
terminology for tunnels and things like

736
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,130
that I would encourage you to look at

737
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,260
the T tunnel modeling's work that's been

738
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,700
done there's a fair bit of work that's

739
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,920
gone into how the associations are

740
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,529
specified for connections belonging to

741
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,900
various Colonels across various

742
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,700
technology so take a look at that before

743
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,210
you make any recommendations in this

744
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,710
topic

745
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:41,190
okay sure thanks thank you much

746
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,990
so you have a unified some interesting

747
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,990
issue to you to work on here so please

748
00:37:46,760 --> 00:38:07,440
so what makes presenters is the first

749
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:13,950
worker is state - synchronization

750
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:16,320
between states for PCs and firstly let's

751
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,230
briefly recap what has been done in

752
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,380
these drafts so basically it's a yeah

753
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:27,840
original motivation is to describe the

754
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:31,290
procedure for the sync up function

755
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:35,070
between the states of PCU communications

756
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,330
and the objective is to make the

757
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:39,300
deployment of pce

758
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:43,770
in a more resilient way and we can solve

759
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:46,920
the computation and loop issues for the

760
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:49,130
dependent task computation like the

761
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,740
diversity so basically we have also

762
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:56,670
included a scenario so is written NPC

763
00:38:52,740 --> 00:39:02,609
for backup or to the load balance and we

764
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:05,430
are also looking to the applicability of

765
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:09,120
this mackensen into the inter domain PC

766
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:11,460
and the hierarchical PC is nervous so

767
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:16,700
this work has been discussed previously

768
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:19,800
in ITF 100 which is almost two years ago

769
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:25,680
so since the present her has a bad

770
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:28,410
memory and I'd like to reintroduce some

771
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:33,690
of the key concept in the draft so

772
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:35,879
firstly with har get all set up at this

773
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:40,190
obsession between the state for PCs

774
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:45,210
which is named as state sync session and

775
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:47,960
the second object would be say to

776
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:51,680
synchronize the RSP state between this

777
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:57,480
the state OPC is using this session and

778
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:00,870
this kind of say synchronization can be

779
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,370
applied to in both directions and only

780
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:08,549
the incremental state would be required

781
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:10,770
for the state single synchronization so

782
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,530
that would be also risky because if you

783
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:17,610
miss one of them or you duplicated some

784
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:19,680
of the wrong state information that

785
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:23,910
would be a kind of inconsistent data

786
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,690
base between the PC NPCs so we also

787
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:32,029
introduced the master and the slave

788
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:36,240
relationship between the pcs so for

789
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:38,910
multiple errors piece and one PC you can

790
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,359
become the master and the other can be

791
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:46,980
the slave and all the RSPCA is a kind of

792
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:51,930
dedicated to the master pcs and we also

793
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:55,380
have some minor contributed have to

794
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,629
describe say the use a draft database

795
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,270
portion to maintain the latest change

796
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,760
and also we need to maintain the earth

797
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:06,690
piece data from multiple sources and we

798
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,510
use an example to describe a a kind of

799
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:13,560
how this state of synchronization is

800
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:18,060
done so we assume in the figure this is

801
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,220
a time order of the three phases and we

802
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,480
have one PCC connecting with two

803
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:26,009
different pcs and there is a kind of

804
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:30,230
synchronization request is between the

805
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:34,200
two pcs so basically are as very

806
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:37,350
beginning time phase we have the PCC

807
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,750
trigger let's call it a dream message to

808
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:43,350
both PC number one and PC number two

809
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,210
but unfortunately the delay of the PC

810
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,600
message delivery is different or

811
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,770
Tuesday's to PC is so it is possible

812
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,560
that a while is

813
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:56,550
one of them is to reach earlier than the

814
00:41:52,560 --> 00:42:00,150
other so this problem would be somehow

815
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:04,140
solved by using the states of

816
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:09,230
synchronization sessions and finally the

817
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:13,230
PC to will recorder the latest RSP state

818
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:15,990
Korea I received from the PCE one before

819
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,630
receives a responding message from PCC

820
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,540
and then we suppose there is another

821
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:25,380
changer that market has a yellow one on

822
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:29,490
the slides and PCC also need to trigger

823
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:34,100
the changes to both of the PCs and again

824
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:35,549
it reach the PCE number one first or so

825
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:42,960
out great

826
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:45,869
thank you yeah so meanwhile when the PCC

827
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,360
number one is propagating the the yellow

828
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:50,730
message for the PC 2 is still receiving

829
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:57,780
the message from the PCC so that which

830
00:42:50,730 --> 00:43:00,869
is a kind of not synchronized the state

831
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,030
but to give him the mackensen specified

832
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:06,080
in this document we allow the PC number

833
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:11,550
2 to figure out which is the latest

834
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:14,940
RSP state with different value and then

835
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:17,580
the PC number to understand he need to

836
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:21,540
ignore the the Korean War which is the

837
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:25,350
old one so and finally there is a kind

838
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,900
of late message from the PCC who if you

839
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:32,509
see number two but that would not affect

840
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:39,000
any changes in the in the RSP database

841
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:41,640
so we okay we looked back to what has

842
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,910
been discussed in IETF 100 and all

843
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:49,100
comments has been clarified oh how the

844
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:53,368
PC is interacting with each other and we

845
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:56,009
have addressed this kind of problem by

846
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:59,430
aligned with other state for PCs and

847
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:03,030
hierarchical PC of work so this would be

848
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:06,270
an important mechanism you

849
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:09,720
for the Mokpo PCU session so we request

850
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:13,350
to the working group to adopt this draft

851
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:18,209
or and it's the protein to the adoption

852
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:31,920
queue yes sir that do it now okay that's

853
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:34,560
all for presentation any comments I

854
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,510
personally feel that this is important

855
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,570
some some of our recent publishing work

856
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:43,830
like stateful HPC and actn work also

857
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:46,020
referred to this document so this is if

858
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:48,900
I have feeling that has not been seen by

859
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,670
the right set of eyes yet so should we

860
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,300
ask how many people have read how many

861
00:44:50,670 --> 00:45:00,020
people have read this document okay

862
00:44:53,300 --> 00:45:03,960
that's good should we check the interest

863
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:06,720
so how many people feel that this work

864
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,460
is whether we should be working on this

865
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:14,939
document as a inside a working group

866
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:19,500
okay so almost the same set of people

867
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:25,260
and anybody has any objection on working

868
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:27,360
group taking on this work none good good

869
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,830
we will reconfirm anyway as our usual

870
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:33,180
process things on the list thank you

871
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:37,020
Thanks as always we open the technical

872
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,700
contribution to how this work and there

873
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,300
are some commands to be addressed anyway

874
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:50,160
but know again nothing to prevent a

875
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:52,890
motion to other operation this is how me

876
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:57,120
again and this time I marked my name

877
00:45:52,890 --> 00:46:00,210
with a color so the next presentation is

878
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:04,400
about the extension or say for PCE to

879
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:08,130
allow optional processing of the PC PC

880
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,750
objects so basically we see this kind of

881
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:13,950
discussion all the layers are talking

882
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:16,460
about the processing of flags and it's

883
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,460
kind of

884
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:21,959
Seabury is a kind of mist when we

885
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:26,390
migrated from City less PC to late fall

886
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:30,959
and this graph to specify the usage of

887
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:35,549
PFLAG and I flag in a piece of message

888
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:41,538
so PFLAG is the semantic meaning is to

889
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:44,930
indicate whether the object is must be

890
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:48,380
processing or it can be optional and

891
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:54,058
I've Clara is a follow up flag

892
00:46:48,380 --> 00:47:00,390
indicating that whether the piece of

893
00:46:54,059 --> 00:47:04,799
speaker can ignore this message so what

894
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:08,489
has been done in the States for PCE RFC

895
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:13,559
82 thirty one is they have specified the

896
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:18,269
state for PCE saying that the usage of

897
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:20,249
P&I flag must be set to zero in the

898
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:23,669
transmission and should be ignored on

899
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:27,169
the received so the problem is the

900
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:31,589
behavior on the pni flag in this object

901
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:34,499
this object is somehow stated but see in

902
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:37,109
the other object the specified so the

903
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:41,459
specification is missing and we finally

904
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:47,489
find that some of the object would be

905
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:53,190
useful if they can have the pni flag set

906
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:56,099
or not set so that's the draft that

907
00:47:53,190 --> 00:48:00,420
that's about the draft so we clarify how

908
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:03,829
the pni flaps are used and to identify

909
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:07,999
the optional objects and this is

910
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:11,069
applicable to all the organs a PCE

911
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:13,218
report update and initiate message off

912
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:18,089
semi interstates for style

913
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:21,029
so we also update what would be done if

914
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:27,109
there are some unknown objects based on

915
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:30,089
this kind of flats so so far we have

916
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:30,799
categorized all the PCE into two

917
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:34,920
different

918
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,800
one can proceed as a peon I flag and the

919
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,880
other cannot do this so it would be

920
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:44,190
necessary to introduce a new flapper to

921
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,589
indicate the capability and we use the

922
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:49,500
state for PC capability are we and

923
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:53,220
introduce relaxed format so if this

924
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:58,250
speed is set then the PC you can process

925
00:48:53,220 --> 00:49:02,520
the P&I flag according to this craft and

926
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:06,210
if this is now set then it will always

927
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:10,349
ignore the pni flag so this it is worth

928
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:13,319
noting that so the kind of relaxed flag

929
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:16,560
need to be set by both peers I simply

930
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:19,170
talked with juniper again so about the

931
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,680
relaxed flag and the P and I when you

932
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,869
say ignore is there a way to say best

933
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,390
effort ignore like say you're doing

934
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:29,880
exclusion of multiple addresses or links

935
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:33,089
or nodes you want to go best effort kind

936
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:36,829
of exclusion or inclusion the integral

937
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:39,540
for the ignore means all the

938
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:42,300
informations object will not be taken

939
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:49,349
care there is a case where your

940
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:52,650
computing a backup path know your your

941
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:55,369
exclusion constraint is input yeah but

942
00:49:52,650 --> 00:50:03,150
that you want to do best effort kind of

943
00:49:55,369 --> 00:50:05,940
you know let me clarify I think our C 5

944
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:08,640
4 4 0 when we set the P flag in a

945
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:11,520
request message we basically meant that

946
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,828
PC is free to ignore it but it is

947
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,480
allowed to process it as well so if so

948
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:17,550
ideally what we usually do in this case

949
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,460
if the path is found meeting that

950
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:22,260
constraint we will give that path but if

951
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,470
we are not able to meet the constraint

952
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:27,000
then we will ignore the object yeah my

953
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,730
point so this is best effort in my mind

954
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,060
I don't want to ignore it I want to

955
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:36,329
still consider the object but and on a

956
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,630
best-effort so so so let's say diversity

957
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:42,359
is you know computing to LSP two paths

958
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:44,610
that I diverse I cannot find fully

959
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:47,400
diverse paths they could be neat

960
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:49,620
at one place I'm okay with that is it

961
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,440
possible it's possible in the diversity

962
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,779
Association drop document so within that

963
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,410
Association we try to handle this not at

964
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:01,080
the whole object level oh okay the

965
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:07,069
reason we're discussing this is in the

966
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:07,069
modeling effort we did model this yeah

967
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:21,200
my question is what happens is that we

968
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:24,810
see while doing the path computation

969
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:29,549
okay though there could be two

970
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:33,299
situations it is possible to wanna say

971
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:38,280
inclusion and come up with the path

972
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:40,500
which is longer in delay that if you

973
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,560
would orbit this inclusion

974
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,160
allo and and get it a better delay okay

975
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:50,009
so how do you handle the compromise

976
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:53,190
between two optimizations one is

977
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:57,980
following not mandatory inclusions and

978
00:51:53,190 --> 00:52:00,890
another provided like a birthday way I

979
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,490
think you are asking how to balance

980
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:05,160
optimization between two different

981
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:07,049
parameters yeah yeah how do you know so

982
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,540
basically what this PC is supposed to do

983
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:12,750
if process that was a choice

984
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:16,020
ignoring the inclusion it will come up

985
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:19,260
with a better delay but owner inclusion

986
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:22,670
it it will be closer to the path that

987
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:27,330
was specified but providing was delay I

988
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:30,150
think this is a general problem for past

989
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:33,810
computation and my understanding is the

990
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:37,410
PCC can indicate effective objective

991
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:41,190
function right so since multiple

992
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:44,370
parameters instead of one so that is a

993
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:46,830
little bit away from this document so

994
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,410
what the modeling that we did in T right

995
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,910
so basically the way we addressed this

996
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:54,770
problem which is a big problem right

997
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:57,830
away the resid as honoring this

998
00:52:54,770 --> 00:53:00,060
non-monetary inclusion as a base

999
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:02,160
optimization okay the same as

1000
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:06,270
optimization like this delay and we

1001
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:09,149
provide basically the weight to the

1002
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:11,450
optimization then PC knows exactly what

1003
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:20,360
to do what would be the best

1004
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:20,359
optimization overall you might consider

1005
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,910
I don't know what can do cut it down

1006
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:33,140
with the flags but we can achieve this

1007
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:36,620
by setting our captive functions and

1008
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:43,170
balance between different constraint or

1009
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:45,450
using a kind of like a best effort

1010
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:47,580
actually that's an interesting point but

1011
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:50,750
that was beyond the scope of this very

1012
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:53,910
specific document so well maybe I should

1013
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:55,710
do something in the list only when we

1014
00:53:53,910 --> 00:54:02,120
talk about these things before in the

1015
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:02,120
past but that's far beyond presentation

1016
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:20,100
so okay let's move back to slides and we

1017
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:23,899
given this our flap we can indicate the

1018
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:28,410
capability of the PC to preceding or

1019
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:31,710
these two flags and then we keep the

1020
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:35,430
definition on how to use a P flag and I

1021
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:37,650
flag so for the P flag firstly the

1022
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:40,410
semantic meaning is to indicate whether

1023
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:43,650
the object so with this flag is

1024
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:45,450
mandatory if the flap is set or it's

1025
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:51,020
just the option now if the flap it's not

1026
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:54,710
set so different message rule requests

1027
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:59,040
the flag is indicated apart by different

1028
00:54:54,710 --> 00:55:03,800
entity in different messages so in PCI

1029
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,420
update and initiate message with PC is

1030
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:11,119
entity who should indicate the PFLAG

1031
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:13,670
processing and PCE

1032
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:18,769
report manager this this black rupee

1033
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:21,529
indicate by by PCC and P equals one

1034
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:24,499
means the object must be taking into

1035
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:26,749
account and P equals zero means the

1036
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:29,689
object that can be ignored in the

1037
00:55:26,749 --> 00:55:33,200
discussion from the etheric or the best

1038
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:39,079
air filter is a sub case for P equals to

1039
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:42,259
zero and four regarding was a flag so in

1040
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:47,390
the it would be effective being PC

1041
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:52,160
update and report message and when it is

1042
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:56,960
set it means the there is an optional

1043
00:55:52,160 --> 00:56:01,160
object it proceeds is processed and if

1044
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:03,529
it is not not set it means the the

1045
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:08,839
object is not going to be processed and

1046
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:11,359
indicated by by by different a PC or PC

1047
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:16,910
in the PC update Henry report

1048
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:23,299
accordingly and it would be noted that

1049
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:27,700
in the PC initiated that there is a flag

1050
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:27,700
its minimis and should be ignored so

1051
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:37,729
with semantic meaning of the PFLAG and I

1052
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:40,519
flag basically its PFLAG it's the PC

1053
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:44,680
sees sorry the PC speaker need to check

1054
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:49,519
the status of PFLAG and the to process

1055
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,098
in so following a procedure flowchart so

1056
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:55,598
the first step is to check if the Platt

1057
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:59,029
flag is set and need to determine did

1058
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:02,749
decide whether the PC speaker is free to

1059
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:05,660
ignore and if the flag is set then that

1060
00:57:02,749 --> 00:57:08,808
is II also need to figure out whether

1061
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:13,910
there are some unknown objects in the

1062
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:18,109
object er we and if there is because P

1063
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:21,229
flag is set and the PC must process so

1064
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:24,819
if there is unknown if there is unknown

1065
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:28,069
objects the precept should reject the

1066
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:31,849
request always I error message and if

1067
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:35,930
everything is known that would be a kind

1068
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:40,609
of normal procedure processing so in

1069
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:42,710
this working document we reuse the RSP

1070
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:47,319
error code TR we define the instead for

1071
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:52,599
PC RFC and we have not introduced NC new

1072
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:57,920
so the status okay

1073
00:57:52,599 --> 00:58:00,880
the status is we we updated the the text

1074
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,970
by adding the dedication scenario and

1075
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,040
the state the problem space has been

1076
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:09,439
confirmed now the mailing list and we

1077
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,380
believe there are other documented

1078
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,990
talking about other flats and people

1079
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:18,290
agreed although useful of the document

1080
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:21,680
so again we our request for the working

1081
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:29,990
group to adopt this work that's all for

1082
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:38,060
the presentation you come on from room

1083
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:43,578
and your other commits I mean since I'm

1084
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:45,430
correctly in 1831 updates if I

1085
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:49,190
understand this correctly you're not

1086
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:53,000
proposing any change 282 31 you're

1087
00:58:49,190 --> 00:59:05,710
proposing and an extension that people

1088
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:11,410
could choose to implement yes okay thing

1089
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:16,569
so but this one I think we don't you

1090
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:18,640
have some problem socialization to which

1091
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:23,020
even that on I think it is linked to a

1092
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:26,558
moral issue that has been raised Monday

1093
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:29,640
comin from turrican ego so glad to see

1094
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,079
some parallel discussion not necessarily

1095
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,558
linked to that graph itself but maybe

1096
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,760
also to diversity graft which is also

1097
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:41,170
tackling some interesting mechanism

1098
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:43,839
linked to tax question so please make

1099
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:46,089
sure that your use case is fine and

1100
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,069
we'll take that to the list of progress

1101
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:56,078
those may be in all the document on this

1102
00:59:48,069 --> 01:00:06,190
one thank you so next presenter is Cheng

1103
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:13,030
Ying Chun Li from Maui my topic today is

1104
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:15,880
convey okay thanks conveying okay the

1105
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:18,880
bank vendor specific information in

1106
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:22,329
peace app extension for a state for PCE

1107
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:26,490
so basically what is than the

1108
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:29,910
specification information so the vendor

1109
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:33,490
information can be arbitrary or

1110
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:36,399
appropriate information such as than the

1111
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:39,819
specific constraint between during the

1112
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,420
post into computation and the price

1113
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:44,799
number uniquely identifies the

1114
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:48,819
organization responsible for the

1115
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:51,819
definition of the content and meaning of

1116
01:00:48,819 --> 01:00:56,069
the vendor specific information so by

1117
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:59,710
definition this implies inequity in

1118
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:02,140
inability to interoperate at the

1119
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:05,109
functional level between the vendors

1120
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:08,680
unless the research there's some

1121
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:11,470
cooperation right so the history of

1122
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:19,710
vendor specific a specific information

1123
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:22,109
is in RFC if 7150 it defined it that

1124
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:26,190
the vendor information objet and theory

1125
01:01:22,109 --> 01:01:32,690
which can be used for I mean stateless

1126
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:37,109
PCE but in I've seen a 74 and 770 it

1127
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:39,630
obsolete the previous one and you find

1128
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:42,598
some milk on point for the theories in

1129
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:46,140
this I've seen the vendors information

1130
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:51,450
TV can be used by the precept object

1131
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:54,450
that allows option theories and also the

1132
01:01:51,450 --> 01:02:00,029
vendor information objects support in

1133
01:01:54,450 --> 01:02:05,250
his PC requires request NPC reply

1134
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:08,940
message but they but this RFC didn't

1135
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:12,599
mention anything of than the information

1136
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:14,430
in for state of all piece set so that is

1137
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:17,700
what we do in this draft

1138
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:21,750
we stands the extension for supports

1139
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:25,970
supporting the state for PC by including

1140
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:30,510
vendor information object in a piece app

1141
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:36,029
report and PC update and as well as this

1142
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:40,680
initiated message so and as well the TV

1143
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:44,400
was already support so what we have done

1144
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:48,259
in this job is we make some extension in

1145
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:51,300
the state of all PC messages such as

1146
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:54,420
peace report and this update and peace

1147
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:59,099
initiate so let's take a look up the

1148
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:03,480
format's of these three messages okay

1149
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:06,619
then questions and next steps so

1150
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:10,290
basically we could like to request the

1151
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:15,450
comments from the working group it did

1152
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:17,609
it is it useful and is it correct and by

1153
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:23,390
the way is there ready for working group

1154
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:23,390
adoption any comments

1155
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:39,609
no one so question of the usefulness is

1156
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:44,160
legitimate so begin to have some

1157
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:46,750
feedback on that correct I think so

1158
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,670
you're using some more different

1159
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:52,270
mechanism make sure it's properly

1160
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:56,820
supported all existing device it so

1161
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:59,470
correctness is okay for me a usefulness

1162
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:01,329
interesting to know about from the

1163
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:05,069
working group so if not today from the

1164
01:04:01,329 --> 01:04:08,079
list that's not a complicated Pokemon so

1165
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:11,579
ready please do we will consider it's

1166
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:18,070
useful to qualify your limitations or

1167
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:28,450
specification this is pretty easy to

1168
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:35,589
understand so yes I see my coming this

1169
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:37,750
is Mike Francisco because for example

1170
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:41,710
not sometimes some vendors you know they

1171
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:43,329
they kind of jump ahead of the of what

1172
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:46,270
the working group is doing and sometimes

1173
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:48,099
it's useful to just do something in a in

1174
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:50,859
the backward compatible way to signal

1175
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:53,230
something and there is also some things

1176
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:55,029
that you know may be very specific to a

1177
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:57,760
vendor that you know so on a signal so I

1178
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:58,940
definitely think it's useful thanks

1179
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,650
thank you

1180
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,650
[Music]

1181
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:18,569
updates 282 sort 182 81 as well yeah

1182
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:18,569
indeed

1183
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:26,140
triumphant I'll come here under now

1184
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:29,829
easier any initiation in the previous

1185
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:33,098
document that limited the unity of the

1186
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:35,700
theory harder message you know you have

1187
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:41,349
Mason and his tiara we had been put into

1188
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:44,710
you to to PMS or message and your uncle

1189
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:47,740
and they you a lot of Sri message so I

1190
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:49,900
think I just want to you know any leave

1191
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:55,990
shakes me in the kind of see reverse

1192
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:59,770
right yeah yeah here

1193
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:04,299
easy Ernie you something you now see 7

1194
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:14,170
for 17 to restricted the tyranny POV you

1195
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:17,859
in other let me try if I understood your

1196
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:20,020
question correctly the 7 for 7 0 said

1197
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:23,140
that this theory can be carried in any

1198
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:25,480
object that allow optional TLV so that's

1199
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:28,720
why when we define stateful objects like

1200
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:31,000
SRP and LSP object we were able to carry

1201
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,290
the TLV but we were not able to carry

1202
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,750
the of judges yes

1203
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:36,220
so this document simply says that you

1204
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:40,569
can also carry the vendor information

1205
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:43,750
object not just the TLB okay yeah

1206
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:46,240
basically what we have done is we tried

1207
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:51,609
should do something that that that is

1208
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:55,859
missed in that I see yes so you stopped

1209
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:59,529
just run to make the vendor information

1210
01:06:55,859 --> 01:07:06,369
object the P in care DD in the PCP

1211
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:09,069
exactly just answer I suppose this work

1212
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:12,099
I mean it's beautiful and in my previous

1213
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:14,170
slide who are going to use it for what

1214
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:16,920
useful stuff so I think it should be

1215
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:20,370
progressing okay okay

1216
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:36,030
Thanks thank you for feedback so next

1217
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:39,240
presenter is Mike again hi this is Mike

1218
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:42,390
coalition from Cisco so I'll be

1219
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:45,390
presenting some brainstorming that we

1220
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:51,299
had about how do you a signal ecmp and

1221
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:53,250
UCM key information in kissa so we are

1222
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:57,600
motivated by the need to encode multiple

1223
01:07:53,250 --> 01:08:00,030
segment lists for SRT policies some of

1224
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:03,150
you may know 30 policies they have these

1225
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:06,500
are candidate paths and which candidate

1226
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:12,060
path has multiple segment lists which

1227
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:14,940
have you CMP among them so I just quote

1228
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:17,100
the segment routing policy draft here so

1229
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,980
I highlighted that it's basically saying

1230
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:22,440
that the PC may compute not just a

1231
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:24,839
single segment list but a set of segment

1232
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:30,750
lists as a solution to the optimization

1233
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:32,760
problem so doing kind of our

1234
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:37,109
brainstorming we realize that there is

1235
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:41,070
actually two use cases here so one the

1236
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:45,569
first use case is when you have a single

1237
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:48,120
optimization objective and this was the

1238
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:51,240
solution to that objective is multiple

1239
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,859
ecmp paths and the second use case is

1240
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:56,420
when you have multiple optimization

1241
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:59,790
objectives and you want ecmp among those

1242
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:01,620
objectives so you want a signal both

1243
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:04,529
these are valid use cases and in fact

1244
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:06,750
they're kind of orthogonal which means

1245
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:10,080
that they can exist independently of

1246
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:12,600
each other so here I'll give an example

1247
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:16,350
LS p1 and LSB - you have different

1248
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:22,800
optimization objectives and the PCC

1249
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:28,440
wants to have a CMP among LS p1 and LSB

1250
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:29,250
- so LS p1 gets single path X and speak

1251
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:36,870
to get

1252
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:40,319
to ecmp paths y&z and so as a result 50%

1253
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:41,210
of the traffic goes on tax 25 1 y and 25

1254
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,640
on that

1255
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:48,859
so we'll see later that how we propose

1256
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,859
to represent this in Pisa

1257
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:55,530
so for use case 1 which is the single

1258
01:09:53,040 --> 01:10:03,210
optimization objective yielding multiple

1259
01:09:55,530 --> 01:10:08,040
paths we we basically propose three ways

1260
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:10,890
to or sir two ways to encode this and we

1261
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:14,850
would need to extend Pisa to specify the

1262
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:18,030
maximum number of paths that PCC can

1263
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:21,240
handle so for example if the if the

1264
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:24,330
router can can install like 32 outgoing

1265
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:27,570
paths with UC and PU and it would just

1266
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:33,559
need to signal that number 32 and then

1267
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:38,160
the PC would reply with 32 or less

1268
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:40,710
unequal cost multi paths and so are two

1269
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,410
kind of options that we proposed here

1270
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:48,140
are basically different ways of putting

1271
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:52,200
multiple euro objects into the same LSP

1272
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:55,040
so option a would be to introduce this

1273
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,019
yellow attribute object and basically

1274
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:03,990
use it as a separator to separate

1275
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:06,300
different arrows so basically it needs

1276
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:11,099
to carry the weight and needs to carry

1277
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:14,390
the upper status for each using P path

1278
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:17,550
and can carry optional T of ease and

1279
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:21,270
then option B is something that drew

1280
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:25,620
suggested basically this is to reuse

1281
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:28,740
something from T to MP and here we we

1282
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:36,840
can use already existing objects to

1283
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:40,740
separate the arrows so there's already

1284
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,840
this this type of us to our us object

1285
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:45,330
that is actually very similar to what

1286
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,100
we're proposing so if we go with this

1287
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:49,140
approach we we just need to define one

1288
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:52,860
new TLD for it

1289
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:56,270
to carry the weight and basically this

1290
01:11:52,860 --> 01:12:01,380
is what the the encoding would look like

1291
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:03,600
so you see arrow 1 + 0 2 they're both

1292
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:08,220
encoded under the same LSP and they're

1293
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:12,360
separated by these endpoints in STL a

1294
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:14,820
subject and basically the advantage of

1295
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:17,580
this approach of option B is that you

1296
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:20,700
can reuse the RB n F that's already

1297
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:26,010
there in the RFC and you just need to

1298
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:28,620
define one single TOB to use so use case

1299
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:30,780
2 is a is a completely different use

1300
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,599
case so it's basically if you have if

1301
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:36,269
the PCC knows in advance how many

1302
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:39,450
objectives it has so if it wants like

1303
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:43,200
one path on red and one path on blue and

1304
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:45,599
once ecmp among those two paths then

1305
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:48,720
basically the LS the PCC will allocate

1306
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,720
different piece of tunnel and tunnel in

1307
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:54,180
the sense of my previous presentation

1308
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:56,970
for each objective and it would create

1309
01:12:54,180 --> 01:13:01,440
some new Association type for example

1310
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:06,450
code EMP Association - by buying these

1311
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:08,969
tunnels together so here I give an

1312
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:10,650
example of how these two use cases are

1313
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:15,120
orthogonal and they exist at the same

1314
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:17,129
time so I already gave this example I

1315
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,040
mean in the previous slide so I'm just

1316
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:23,070
gonna give the piece up representation

1317
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:25,380
so if you have 1 LSB or so if the PCC

1318
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:28,980
has constrained for example it wants 50%

1319
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:32,880
traffic on red 50% on blue then we

1320
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:36,120
create like sp1 and I will speak to you

1321
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:40,590
and put them in a single Association but

1322
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:43,590
within the LSP itself there is the

1323
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:48,800
option to give to return multiple equal

1324
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:50,360
cost multi paths so that you could have

1325
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,800
you know 50

1326
01:13:50,360 --> 01:14:00,049
going on red as one path and 50% going

1327
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:03,440
on blue eyes as two paths so that's what

1328
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:04,100
this is and that's the end of my

1329
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:17,960
presentation

1330
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:26,530
oh and Peter can you go to the slide

1331
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:30,739
where you mention piece of tunnel okay

1332
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:37,389
to console yourself

1333
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:40,009
so one a can you go to one a the example

1334
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:43,250
yeah I think you have the Pearson yeah

1335
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:47,239
yeah I think you can still retain this

1336
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:50,000
existing vnf if you introduce a sub

1337
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:53,650
object to carry the ingress hop action

1338
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,810
okay so if we ever extend piece up to

1339
01:14:53,650 --> 01:15:00,138
signal a multipath why a dag you could

1340
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:04,420
reuse the same sub TLV so and then that

1341
01:15:00,139 --> 01:15:07,250
way you could still use the existing BNF

1342
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:09,170
today we do have precedence for a CRO

1343
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:12,520
very inside a production object as a

1344
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:15,230
second sub object so if you think of the

1345
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,820
load balance specifier as an english

1346
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:19,099
action you can just put it as a sub

1347
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:24,799
clearly so that's one comment like can

1348
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:28,670
you go further up this one way yeah yeah

1349
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:30,710
so when you say different piece of

1350
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:32,989
tunnel what do you mean here

1351
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:35,690
so I mean exactly what I meant in my

1352
01:15:32,989 --> 01:15:38,659
previous presentation today okay Tohno

1353
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:41,509
is the thing identified by the PSP okay

1354
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:42,799
so there's a single pls PID you would

1355
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:44,600
create if you want to different

1356
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,790
associate us to different objectives you

1357
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,790
would create two different PSP IDs okay

1358
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:51,280
yeah that works thing just one

1359
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:55,100
clarification

1360
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,550
even if he do sub objects to do a ro

1361
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,980
list

1362
01:15:55,550 --> 01:16:00,050
we still need to update our be enough

1363
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,419
because our problem is our report update

1364
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,240
message only allow us to put one Jaros

1365
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,850
object

1366
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:08,160
so Liz you have two options that one is

1367
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,960
today the semantics of ero would say

1368
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,000
that you process the first one and if

1369
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:18,030
you see more than one year or you ignore

1370
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:20,060
the rest or you could use a CRO as for

1371
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:24,210
the additional ones and this and that

1372
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:25,920
fits your en of a arrow / ero followed

1373
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:29,370
by C arrows and all of them carry the

1374
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,530
same I think our piece of I'll be enough

1375
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:33,210
is little bit different so I discuss

1376
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:39,809
this with you and we can go over this

1377
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:44,640
 hi it's Aaron again as an

1378
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:47,550
individual I'm trying to sort out in my

1379
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:51,960
head how the weighting of traffic across

1380
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:54,960
this set is different from the flowspec

1381
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:59,940
work that we've got in other words it's

1382
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:05,070
telling the system what traffic to put

1383
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:08,730
on which LSP is that is that a

1384
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:09,990
reasonable question to ask don't have

1385
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:12,709
the answer for you I think that's

1386
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:15,420
reasonable questions so I think let me

1387
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:20,250
reply actually on the mailing list yeah

1388
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:23,430
sure thank you John from Hawaii and my

1389
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:26,280
question is when I use the Association

1390
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:30,980
group 2 Association the least or the ero

1391
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:35,670
that we can beauty like ECM pou CMP

1392
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:39,839
daños and I think we have a draft in

1393
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:41,760
four as a policy in peace app was the

1394
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:47,460
relation between this draft and that

1395
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:50,060
draft yeah so basically there's two use

1396
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:54,270
cases right so in the first year's case

1397
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:56,310
you don't know in advance how many ecmp

1398
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:59,910
paths you will get you just simply say I

1399
01:17:56,310 --> 01:18:03,180
can install up to thirty two paths okay

1400
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:05,250
and the PC then may give you one path or

1401
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:08,340
it may give you two paths or it may give

1402
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:10,500
you sixteen paths or thirty two paths in

1403
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:13,380
the second use case that's where you use

1404
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,780
the optimization objective that's why I

1405
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:17,370
use the Association object to bind the

1406
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:20,599
different Association objectives that's

1407
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:23,880
when you know the PCC knows in advance

1408
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:29,190
how many objectives it has in it that's

1409
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:31,380
when the association is used so you can

1410
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:33,660
really use the association object in the

1411
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:37,170
first news case because the PCC does not

1412
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:51,480
know in advance how many hours piece it

1413
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:54,690
it will cut the line of so on the same

1414
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:57,599
slide I heard you say the two approaches

1415
01:18:54,690 --> 01:19:02,070
are orthogonal but can't coexist yeah I

1416
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:05,220
was confused to me the second example

1417
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:08,549
option second option is a specific case

1418
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:11,310
of you know the first option is a

1419
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:15,000
specific case of the second meaning one

1420
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:18,330
LSP one optimization objective is a

1421
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,490
specific case of multiple SPS and each

1422
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:23,370
have a different optimization objective

1423
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:25,469
do you see it differently yes okay I am

1424
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:29,640
not clear if you can clarify I mean I'll

1425
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:32,100
give an example there so it's that's

1426
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,440
where what I'm trying to say is you have

1427
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,900
to you have two LS B's here and each has

1428
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:40,830
its own objective function objective

1429
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:43,740
function strange objective function and

1430
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:45,720
constraints but if you wanted one

1431
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:48,300
objective function and one constraint

1432
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:52,890
you're free it's a special case of the I

1433
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:56,670
mean I don't see but you create to say

1434
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:59,670
you can install 32 CMP paths would you

1435
01:19:56,670 --> 01:20:02,700
create 32 what I'm trying to say it's a

1436
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:05,760
it's an operator decision to specify I

1437
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:07,530
want multiple or one I understand but

1438
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,060
basically the problem is becomes very

1439
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:12,210
inconvenient because say if your router

1440
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:15,450
can install 32 ec MPs then you would

1441
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:19,170
need to say create 32 empty osp's

1442
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:21,000
delegate them to the PC and then the PC

1443
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:22,920
you would give you maybe one path and

1444
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,100
there are say be empty so all the

1445
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,920
details and one policy I might choose to

1446
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,660
do one LSP one objective another policy

1447
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,210
I might choose

1448
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,470
do two of them two of journalist p1

1449
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:36,260
objective you can't have two objectives

1450
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:39,230
for LSP that's that someone I said I

1451
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:42,740
said one policy one LSP one objective

1452
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:45,799
another policy to LSPs and two

1453
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:47,269
objectives on the same box and the PCE

1454
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,920
should be able to me there's no there's

1455
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:51,020
no policy your first of all right so

1456
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,120
that's why I'm giving you an option

1457
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:56,150
where there is a policy so I'm not sure

1458
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:59,480
where the policy is in terms of policy

1459
01:20:56,150 --> 01:21:02,150
is something SRTP SEP is okay okay so

1460
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,919
what i'm okay i think we regardless i

1461
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:06,230
think we should be generalizing rather

1462
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,540
than restricting and yes so this is the

1463
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:10,490
movies to is the generalization and for

1464
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,690
it i believe that they're both

1465
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:16,730
orthogonal and the only way to

1466
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:19,490
generalize it is can i apologize i

1467
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:28,309
didn't read your draft and I didn't even

1468
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:32,090
hear your presentation so my question is

1469
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:37,160
that say if I ask for say 100 G pass

1470
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:39,500
okay and can PC return an answer such

1471
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:42,950
drug that I cannot do it in one short

1472
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:47,800
but I can do it say in two ways one is

1473
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:50,540
40 G and another in 60 G yes exactly

1474
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:53,390
okay okay and then and then you can use

1475
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:56,390
this as setting up for example a set of

1476
01:21:53,390 --> 01:22:00,050
what Ovilus piece right that can

1477
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:02,060
collectively provide the there yeah well

1478
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:05,150
you can say I want like a hundred gig

1479
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:07,250
path and with certain constraint like

1480
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:10,490
you know going on some certain set of

1481
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:12,410
links and I also want like another

1482
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:15,139
hundred gig path on some other set of

1483
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:17,080
links and that is use case too but the

1484
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:21,050
original use case that you gave is a

1485
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:23,900
basically if you if you request that you

1486
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:27,350
want 100 gigs but the PC cannot give you

1487
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:29,839
one path that satisfies 100 gigs so it

1488
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:32,240
would give you two paths back right and

1489
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,590
say you cmp among them can it give like

1490
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,110
a several options like for example

1491
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:38,240
either this two of these three something

1492
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:40,790
like that that collectively well

1493
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:43,150
satisfies one hungry G or it's just one

1494
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:46,269
this duel is I'm

1495
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:49,809
I mean say I can do it in one short

1496
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:56,680
right but I can do either like 60 and 40

1497
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:59,590
or like 300 basically that's that's an

1498
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:02,200
interesting I mean you could have like a

1499
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:04,060
whole bunch of different you know

1500
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,130
different solutions I mean there are

1501
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:07,870
solutions that you can choose yeah

1502
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,020
currently I mean what kind of we're

1503
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:13,410
thinking is to I mean you only have one

1504
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:16,900
but that's a good idea

1505
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:19,050
okay so consider that because we're also

1506
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:24,549
considering that okay thanks

1507
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:28,870
kiss me quick gesture so to adjust

1508
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:31,450
audience question the binding of factor

1509
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:35,470
T know is coming in BGP update as color

1510
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:39,639
and point so this is how you know which

1511
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:42,010
still associated with which fat here we

1512
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:44,230
are mixing a bunch of use cases and I

1513
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:48,850
think we should decouple them one of

1514
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:51,339
them sin get when you use PC to compute

1515
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:54,880
to know our number of tools associated

1516
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:57,520
with the policy rather than trying to

1517
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,170
provide segmented to knows because we

1518
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,640
cannot satisfy a particular number of

1519
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:02,800
constraints that two completely

1520
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:07,210
different things and mixing them creates

1521
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:09,720
lot of confusion and say it's different

1522
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:13,270
things I agree but we need to mix them

1523
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:20,470
in order to be general you know you need

1524
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:25,200
to become problem in order to sure but

1525
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:25,200
solve one problem and then every game

1526
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:34,980
thank you Mike so the next presenter is

1527
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,980
human

1528
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:50,630
so my name is human wit Kohli from Nokia

1529
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:55,519
I'm new to this working group please be

1530
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:57,230
kind as the French say in Mexico good so

1531
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:03,739
this graph is about point-to-multipoint

1532
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:06,379
policy so just to give an idea why we

1533
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:08,450
are introducing this graph and I think

1534
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:10,400
on the unicast side we have done a

1535
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:13,250
really good job for the next generation

1536
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:15,830
networks to be simplified when I say

1537
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:19,280
simplify I mean we are a controller

1538
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:21,880
removing some of the MPLS protocols but

1539
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:25,910
multicast is kind of lagging behind

1540
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:29,239
we do have protocols like B which uses

1541
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:32,950
the underlay IGP but when it comes to an

1542
01:25:29,239 --> 01:25:36,320
MPLS transport as of now we really need

1543
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:39,769
rsvp-te point-to-multipoint MLBPA etc

1544
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:43,130
etc so just to be in par with unicorns

1545
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:45,969
we try to introduce this draft that uses

1546
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:48,020
a controller very thin layer of

1547
01:25:45,969 --> 01:25:51,310
communication between the controller and

1548
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:53,270
the PC see we are starting with Pisa

1549
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:56,600
eventually we probably going to move on

1550
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:59,840
to other protocol su but basically the

1551
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,690
controller figures out the tree using

1552
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,120
bgp LS it has all the states in the

1553
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:07,820
network it sees the route and the Leafs

1554
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:10,099
it calculates the path from the root to

1555
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:13,580
the Leafs via a set of policies which

1556
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:16,040
I'll explain later on and it uses PCE to

1557
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:21,380
download or Pisa to download all that

1558
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:23,060
information to the PCC so basically what

1559
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:26,060
this will give the operators going

1560
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:28,780
forward is to bring the multicast in the

1561
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:30,140
same level as unique as from program

1562
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:35,000
programmability

1563
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:38,780
on the on the router itself so to do

1564
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,670
this there is a couple of objects or

1565
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:43,429
segments that we are introducing in

1566
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:46,100
spring and one of them is the point to

1567
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:48,050
multi-point segment so basically the

1568
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,850
simplest way to explain the point to

1569
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:53,300
multi-point segment it's it's a

1570
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:54,800
container that contains the route and a

1571
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,300
set of Leafs and it needs to be

1572
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,389
identified

1573
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:02,090
a set of parameters which you can read

1574
01:26:59,389 --> 01:27:04,790
the draft and figure that out how the

1575
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:07,599
root and the leaf are discovered there

1576
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:12,920
is nothing new we can discover them via

1577
01:27:07,599 --> 01:27:16,699
NP BGP procedures was at the entry and

1578
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:19,790
VPN procedures the RFC 6514 6513 all

1579
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:22,610
those discoveries can become indicated

1580
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:24,469
up to the PCE we are the mechanism that

1581
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:26,690
you guys already have and invented

1582
01:27:24,469 --> 01:27:29,030
previously as you will read it in the

1583
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:31,040
draft or later on in these slides so

1584
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:32,389
there is nothing new here the only thing

1585
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,050
you gotta keep in mind is you need to

1586
01:27:32,389 --> 01:27:38,750
understand what is a point-to-multipoint

1587
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:40,489
segment so the next part is as I

1588
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:42,650
mentioned point-to-multipoint segments

1589
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:44,869
actually contains the rule and a set of

1590
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:46,429
leaves obviously between the root and

1591
01:27:44,869 --> 01:27:48,589
the Leafs there's a replication points

1592
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:50,960
and that's what the replication segment

1593
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:53,360
comes in in a simplest way to think

1594
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,880
about sitting a replication segment

1595
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:59,780
think of it as a forwarding instruction

1596
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:03,469
at each new at each no that's a simplest

1597
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:06,679
way of putting it incoming seed incoming

1598
01:28:03,469 --> 01:28:09,949
label for a segment label for a

1599
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:12,020
replication segment that identifies the

1600
01:28:09,949 --> 01:28:15,110
resource and then you have the outgoing

1601
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:18,050
interfaces with outgoing labels that

1602
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:19,579
will connect you to the next replication

1603
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:21,889
segment that's it

1604
01:28:19,579 --> 01:28:25,009
that's all one thing you need to keep in

1605
01:28:21,889 --> 01:28:31,070
mind is pure replication segments they

1606
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:33,230
can be disjoint via a unicast SR segment

1607
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:36,170
if you will in that case you guys have

1608
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:39,230
already invented the seedless we use a

1609
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:41,599
Sibley's the the unique as is our policy

1610
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:44,750
to connect to replication segments

1611
01:28:41,599 --> 01:28:47,510
together and our important thing to keep

1612
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:49,670
in mind here is replication segments

1613
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:52,940
they cannot be stacked

1614
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:54,829
why is that the reason for that is when

1615
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:57,678
you get to a replication point that you

1616
01:28:54,829 --> 01:29:00,730
have multiple OFS outgoing or if's

1617
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:03,440
if you start stacking stacking segments

1618
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:05,480
multicast segments where you really

1619
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:09,409
cannot go through every single one of

1620
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:09,949
those labels to figure out which is the

1621
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:13,129
leaf

1622
01:29:09,949 --> 01:29:16,249
disconnected on beach of' in malta in in

1623
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:19,459
multicast you know if you look at only

1624
01:29:16,249 --> 01:29:21,559
the top of the the list if you will it

1625
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:24,079
will not give you the entire picture on

1626
01:29:21,559 --> 01:29:26,989
that replication segment for all

1627
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:28,759
outgoing interfaces so this is why when

1628
01:29:26,989 --> 01:29:31,400
it comes to the replication segment

1629
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:34,400
there is only a single label that single

1630
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:37,249
label on that note will identify the

1631
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:39,469
outgoing interfaces and the labels or

1632
01:29:37,249 --> 01:29:42,199
the seats that are being used to the

1633
01:29:39,469 --> 01:29:45,050
next one again this is only true for

1634
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:48,379
replication segments you can connect to

1635
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:52,340
replication segments via a seedless and

1636
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:54,860
unique ass as our policy so just going

1637
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,659
through the data path very quickly the

1638
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:59,478
source sends a payload that payload is

1639
01:29:56,659 --> 01:30:02,570
the IP gets through outer a router a has

1640
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:04,670
a replication policy that says your to

1641
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:07,099
get to router D and E which are the

1642
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:11,119
Leafs your next hop is a replication

1643
01:30:07,099 --> 01:30:14,269
segment c b.push c payload is on the

1644
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:17,348
bottom we send it the the packet to see

1645
01:30:14,269 --> 01:30:20,209
C looks at the see the label C

1646
01:30:17,349 --> 01:30:22,699
identifies the replication policy or the

1647
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:26,409
replication segment segment looks at

1648
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:30,079
their outgoing instructions the outgoing

1649
01:30:26,409 --> 01:30:31,728
OFS outgoing interfaces figures out what

1650
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:35,840
is the label that it needs to push on

1651
01:30:31,729 --> 01:30:39,079
each interface to D it pushes D to e it

1652
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:42,889
pushes E and it forwards the packet

1653
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:46,549
through the according interface to those

1654
01:30:42,889 --> 01:30:49,039
routers the next one is fast reroute the

1655
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:52,010
PC can camp compute a fast reroute that

1656
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:55,219
bypasses the link between a and C that's

1657
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:58,489
via router G that fast reroute could be

1658
01:30:55,219 --> 01:31:01,479
TI l fa it could be RSVP T it could be

1659
01:30:58,489 --> 01:31:04,909
anything it's beyond the scope of these

1660
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:06,530
draft but you have the fast reroute that

1661
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:09,739
is sitting on the data path and you can

1662
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:11,900
achieve very fast fast readouts here's

1663
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:15,678
an example when there is a node that

1664
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:19,429
does not support replication segment on

1665
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,909
the on the network that's not B and F as

1666
01:31:19,429 --> 01:31:23,659
an example here so in this case is

1667
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,728
because PC

1668
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:28,699
that note B does not support replication

1669
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:31,999
segment they actually push on a label

1670
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:34,070
stack saying that C which is the next

1671
01:31:31,999 --> 01:31:37,010
replication segment is at the bottom of

1672
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:41,780
the stack pushes B for unique hash

1673
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:46,189
unique SSR C and forwards that packet

1674
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:48,919
through B to C B pops a label C gets the

1675
01:31:46,189 --> 01:31:50,719
label label C figures out what is the

1676
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:53,090
replication segment and forwarding

1677
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:55,389
information on C and forwards the packet

1678
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:59,329
that is what as it was in the previous

1679
01:31:55,389 --> 01:32:01,969
slide going forward you can have all the

1680
01:31:59,329 --> 01:32:04,969
good stuff that you guys have in unicast

1681
01:32:01,969 --> 01:32:08,119
canada tad let's speed redundancy fast

1682
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:10,189
reroute etc etc we are using all the

1683
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:12,380
draft all the tools that you guys have

1684
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:14,090
already invented we are not trying to

1685
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:15,739
come up with new mechanism I think you

1686
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:17,780
guys have done a great job previously so

1687
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:18,409
we're just using all those tools all

1688
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:21,079
over again

1689
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:25,009
here's that high-level bird's-eye view

1690
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:25,999
of how the objects loop again some of

1691
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:27,709
the objects that are already there

1692
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:30,349
Canada pads

1693
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:32,239
you know nothing new the only part that

1694
01:32:30,349 --> 01:32:33,439
I as I explained previously is you need

1695
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:36,348
to understand the point to multi-point

1696
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:38,269
policy and the replication policy the

1697
01:32:36,349 --> 01:32:40,969
replication policy can contain multiple

1698
01:32:38,269 --> 01:32:43,880
canada paths and this candidate paths

1699
01:32:40,969 --> 01:32:47,300
can be used as LSP redundancy they could

1700
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:48,889
be end to end or aka global optimization

1701
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:52,489
if you will throughout each one of these

1702
01:32:48,889 --> 01:32:54,709
candidate paths and for the sake of time

1703
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:57,110
I'm not going to go through the details

1704
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:59,539
of what are the bits and bytes in this

1705
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:02,478
graph you can go with the draft one of

1706
01:32:59,539 --> 01:33:04,159
the things that I want to specify it is

1707
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:06,349
that the RFC's that I put in there the

1708
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:07,219
first you RFC's they probably don't make

1709
01:33:06,349 --> 01:33:10,459
sense to anybody

1710
01:33:07,219 --> 01:33:14,030
there should be 82 31 I believe it's all

1711
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:15,860
right yes and the second one is 86 23

1712
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:18,169
which is the new RFC that you just gave

1713
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:21,919
out so those are some of the current

1714
01:33:18,169 --> 01:33:24,800
other sins that we are using we did try

1715
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:27,530
to change and introduce some very minor

1716
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,590
objects which were necessary as an

1717
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:32,780
example we are using the CCI object but

1718
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:34,039
currently in the CCI object you can send

1719
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:36,289
down the single label

1720
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:37,009
going forward we are using or CCI

1721
01:33:36,289 --> 01:33:40,750
objects

1722
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:43,940
on multiple labels for the seed list for

1723
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:45,950
the outgoing interfaces because there

1724
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:47,540
could be multiple outgoing interfaces

1725
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:49,700
hopefully all business stuff are

1726
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:51,560
explained in the draft if they are not

1727
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:55,099
clear please send the email under a

1728
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:56,660
mailing list and the workflow I'm not

1729
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:59,120
going to go through it too much for the

1730
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:00,830
sake of time I want to leave the the

1731
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:03,380
rest of the time open for any question

1732
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:06,260
comments that are there one thing I want

1733
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:08,510
to bring up is that from author's point

1734
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:13,190
of view there is one author missing

1735
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:15,650
which is by the microphone right now so

1736
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:18,830
I do apologize on that you'll be added

1737
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:21,469
on the next one please go I Holman this

1738
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:28,010
is Tarek with juniper I'm gonna go easy

1739
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:31,100
and effective SEO Marcy so Mike we did

1740
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:33,500
this cuss offline and I don't want to

1741
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:37,130
raise it debate here but we should be

1742
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:41,780
open to the replication segments on

1743
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:43,850
transit nodes to be shareable it's a it

1744
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:46,820
we will discuss this further and there

1745
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:50,990
might be reasons why not - I'm open to

1746
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:53,240
them I'll leave it right there and that

1747
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:56,330
that's a very good question and and and

1748
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:57,889
I'm I know you we discussed this but for

1749
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:59,870
the sake of working group I want to

1750
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:03,560
bring up there are some differences

1751
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:06,200
between multicast and unicast one of

1752
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:08,510
those differences is if everybody here

1753
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:11,269
remembers the old way of way we were

1754
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:15,110
doing the unique acid for VP RN even

1755
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:17,600
there was a subnet that was in a verse

1756
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:20,630
that was connected to a tunnel so a

1757
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:24,620
transport tunnel back in the days was

1758
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:26,750
really identifying a subnet itself we

1759
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:29,390
went away on the unique aside from this

1760
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:31,700
mechanism we actually have now a VC

1761
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:33,500
label or a rough label whatever you guys

1762
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:36,110
want to call it that the transport

1763
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,510
tunnel gets you to the end and then you

1764
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:41,630
pop the transport tunnel you look at the

1765
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:44,030
valve label or the the service label

1766
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:45,860
gets you to the to the service and then

1767
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:48,320
you do a lookup in that v RF and you

1768
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:50,820
figure out where is your IP going on

1769
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:55,880
multicast on fortune of behaviors

1770
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:58,190
the stock in the 18th centuries so it a

1771
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:04,440
transport tunnel a point-to-multipoint

1772
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:06,780
LSP can identify a specific SG so you're

1773
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:10,619
absolutely right in some cases we could

1774
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:13,309
use replication and reuse it but for the

1775
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:16,469
cases that that point to multi-point LSP

1776
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:20,489
identifies a specific SG within the

1777
01:36:16,469 --> 01:36:22,530
worth we need to have a unique

1778
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:25,309
identification of that point moil

1779
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:28,949
multi-point lsv throughout the entire

1780
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:30,869
path that's it yes we will work on it

1781
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:33,360
try to figure out whether we can make it

1782
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:46,530
reusable thank you woman thank you very

1783
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:49,559
much I'm thinking about that Shoei

1784
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:54,389
maintain some state of State on the

1785
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:56,429
replication note right when you say is

1786
01:36:54,389 --> 01:36:58,469
say them not question so there is a

1787
01:36:56,429 --> 01:37:01,139
state there's definitely a state on the

1788
01:36:58,469 --> 01:37:03,329
data path and even depending on the

1789
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:05,579
implementation maybe even on the on the

1790
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:07,199
multicast or if they're there there will

1791
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:09,509
be a state it just really moved their

1792
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:30,210
protocol but the thing is if you use

1793
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:33,210
beer so just yes it could be feasible

1794
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:35,280
that two different or multiple yes it

1795
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:37,020
will be a sub all is this code in a

1796
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,909
certain part of the topology share the

1797
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:42,119
same interrupt location state and

1798
01:37:38,909 --> 01:37:45,629
therefore you you know might the

1799
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:48,269
replication policy but they might

1800
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:49,980
diverge you know later down the tree and

1801
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:53,520
so to do what you're suggesting you

1802
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:55,769
probably have a carrier tree or it can

1803
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,829
be policy context in the data plane

1804
01:37:55,770 --> 01:38:02,610
engineer so my point is it is feasible

1805
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:05,820
but it comes at a cost

1806
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:09,480
I reckon sorry I cut the line in the

1807
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:11,580
movie yeah that is talking thank you

1808
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:14,330
so the next presenter is remote that's

1809
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,330
my mom

1810
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:20,450
you know she can be quickly out of time

1811
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:32,820
hello kami yes great I could model today

1812
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:37,230
I'm going to pretend that you snitching

1813
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:39,780
to PC for SR pass protection so first of

1814
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:43,379
introduction we know that some of a

1815
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:47,250
critical real-time at the live traffic

1816
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:50,760
may be transported by SR pass for

1817
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:56,340
example we may have a surpass from where

1818
01:38:50,760 --> 01:39:01,530
Punk to New York Stock Exchange which is

1819
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:07,730
to be used to send requests for buying

1820
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:11,580
or selling stocks we may also have SR

1821
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:16,110
past connection between operational role

1822
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:21,630
and polkas office which is used by

1823
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:24,269
doctors to do remote surgery we may also

1824
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:28,830
have some kind of as a pass to support

1825
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:33,350
life Ethan's life broadcast so for all

1826
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:37,200
these esta pass we need a fast

1827
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:41,370
protections so without fast essa

1828
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:46,650
protection we may have big loss for

1829
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:52,490
example for real-time stock exchange or

1830
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:57,360
trade if we have broken answer a pass

1831
01:39:52,490 --> 01:40:01,590
then we may lost lots of money for

1832
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:06,710
example in the peer market the stock

1833
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:11,010
away going down very fast so bank may

1834
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:14,130
send a request to sell quick as quick as

1835
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:16,440
possible to sell stock before the mock

1836
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:21,240
market going down going down

1837
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:23,639
so in so without fast protection if SF

1838
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:26,880
has broken and then those requests were

1839
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:29,730
not executed faster so we we almost not

1840
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:32,010
so money so for what this case we will

1841
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:38,099
have big loss result faster protection

1842
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:43,260
for SR pass so night speech so we're

1843
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:47,220
given over view about pass protection so

1844
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:50,370
right now we have te else fees so for T

1845
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:53,210
LSP is we have end-to-end fast

1846
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:56,250
protections we have incurred production

1847
01:40:53,210 --> 01:40:59,120
we have a midpoint protection and then

1848
01:40:56,250 --> 01:41:04,410
we also have equals protections

1849
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:08,820
however for SR plus we only have a few

1850
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:11,849
drafts which proposed to put fast

1851
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:15,960
protection for the only middle Point and

1852
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:22,610
the egress ingress so there is a need

1853
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:30,930
for provide fast protections for the

1854
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:34,320
ingress note of SR pass so next page so

1855
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:38,570
the extension for PCC for support has

1856
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:43,429
equal protection is a very good feat

1857
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:48,900
because right now we have PC extensions

1858
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:54,000
for essa passport on oh so he's very

1859
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:59,700
literate to extend the PCE to support SR

1860
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:02,670
pass English protections so next page so

1861
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:04,950
in order to provide SR plus interest

1862
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:07,650
production we need to send some

1863
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:09,929
information which is a lidded for

1864
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:13,500
english production to the bike hub

1865
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:15,840
equals node so the information we need

1866
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:22,530
to send to the bankable ingress egress

1867
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:26,120
not include bike hub as a pass primary

1868
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:30,389
universe node address in some case and

1869
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:34,469
also the description of the traffic

1870
01:42:30,389 --> 01:42:38,969
which is transported by the SA pass in

1871
01:42:34,469 --> 01:42:39,630
addition so essa pass may transport some

1872
01:42:38,969 --> 01:42:43,980
service

1873
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:46,949
so those IDE of that surface which is

1874
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:50,730
transported by the s epatha may also

1875
01:42:46,949 --> 01:42:54,419
need to send solitude the backup equals

1876
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:57,570
note so for this for some of this

1877
01:42:54,420 --> 01:43:01,170
information the encoding we already have

1878
01:42:57,570 --> 01:43:05,429
for example for the SR passed primary of

1879
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:09,780
us because we have extensions for the SR

1880
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:14,460
sake policy in that exchanger where we

1881
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:15,389
already have extensions for support as a

1882
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:18,030
passing coding

1883
01:43:15,389 --> 01:43:22,530
so for pike harbors a passing coding

1884
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:27,480
which we can reuse those encoding for SR

1885
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:30,570
primary path so for the rest of them we

1886
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:34,709
may have some kind of simple extensions

1887
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:39,619
to PCE to support backup of support

1888
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:42,449
image ingress protection so next page

1889
01:43:39,619 --> 01:43:44,969
so before we send all the information to

1890
01:43:42,449 --> 01:43:48,599
packable risk equals note so we also

1891
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:53,310
have Sankar we need to have some kind of

1892
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:55,110
ability exchanges banks ways to save

1893
01:43:53,310 --> 01:44:00,869
time can we skip the encoding and

1894
01:43:55,110 --> 01:44:02,670
directly move to the final questions it

1895
01:44:00,869 --> 01:44:04,320
wouldn't help really not be the best

1896
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:05,670
time like we are running a little bit

1897
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,190
late so people can go through the

1898
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:10,320
encoding in your drafts so let's just

1899
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:15,178
focus on the motivation and some

1900
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:17,159
questions because the encoding is it was

1901
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:19,830
so much weight you psyche it okay so we

1902
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:27,780
need a comments and the suggestions of

1903
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:31,050
discussions for this this one so I think

1904
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:33,150
III raise some questions on the list as

1905
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:35,150
well so I hope like you can answer them

1906
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:39,869
a little bit more clearly and explain

1907
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:42,869
why we would want the backup ingress to

1908
01:44:39,869 --> 01:44:44,309
do this protection and when the source

1909
01:44:42,869 --> 01:44:47,250
is anyway doing the

1910
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:49,680
affection the why should backup ingress

1911
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:51,210
detect and I got the not a direct answer

1912
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:54,060
but I thought the your answer would be

1913
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:56,580
that you don't want to make the backup

1914
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:58,920
path active and only when the fail you

1915
01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:02,040
detect the failure at that time you make

1916
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:03,960
the backup path active so these kind of

1917
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:06,750
use case if you think it exists maybe we

1918
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:09,150
can generalize them and we already do

1919
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:13,080
flowspec for identifying of what flow to

1920
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:15,299
go into a particular particular tunnel

1921
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:17,519
so if you have a particular use case

1922
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:19,770
maybe we can think of doing solving this

1923
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,990
in a more general way rather than just

1924
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:24,810
as a backup ingress that's just my

1925
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:31,320
personal without my chair hat on opinion

1926
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:36,090
thank you I think we need we generalize

1927
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:38,519
this one so have we presented some use

1928
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:41,790
the case in the draft and the pattern

1929
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:43,680
will make a more sense agree yeah yeah

1930
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:48,420
it's different so for orange I'm sorry I

1931
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:51,510
haven't read the draft but it from first

1932
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:53,340
year it's in similar to the Protection

1933
01:45:51,510 --> 01:46:01,620
Association is it really different or

1934
01:45:53,340 --> 01:46:12,990
not okay so what VI what is V very why

1935
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:13,849
did you your voice is lower so yeah

1936
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:16,080
sorry

1937
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:18,750
so you were telling that you'd submit

1938
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:20,790
out of the protection association so in

1939
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:26,130
this case what is the value added that

1940
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:30,500
you are bringing so you mean to which

1941
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:36,810
one have protection association

1942
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:39,450
protection we for let me try to answer

1943
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:41,580
from what I gather the differences with

1944
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:44,490
respect to detection like primary

1945
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:46,410
getting failed that detection we never

1946
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:49,110
talked about it an association draft and

1947
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:51,000
this document somehow says that it's the

1948
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:53,580
job of the backup ingress to somehow

1949
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,950
detect the primary has failed and now

1950
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:57,680
switch the traffic that's what I gather

1951
01:46:55,950 --> 01:47:03,800
I'm not wasn't sure but just

1952
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:09,200
we can move the conversation along so if

1953
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:11,150
we allow that when will we have the

1954
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:25,940
second speaker ready let's go thank you

1955
01:47:11,150 --> 01:47:32,599
for representation thank you let's

1956
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:35,990
present to give a present for my

1957
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:38,960
colleague on yeah all of them are not

1958
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:41,150
able to join a session and therefore

1959
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,890
this contribute for this project in so

1960
01:47:41,150 --> 01:47:45,559
it's about as beautiful she see for

1961
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:46,970
assigning to demand for the over real

1962
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,280
there are some more passing has been

1963
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:51,290
done they are being dying I have in

1964
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,210
different working group so I just what I

1965
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:57,290
could to give an overview of this but I

1966
01:47:53,210 --> 01:48:04,520
want to redesign that's try to save time

1967
01:47:57,290 --> 01:48:07,870
and then next okay okay

1968
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:12,500
for this so I do it just give some

1969
01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:14,150
analysis about what we could do the

1970
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,070
first amazing is a very direct and a

1971
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:19,700
possible association and signalizing is

1972
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:22,040
inter demand pass corrilesa or we can

1973
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:24,710
call it association now this is a

1974
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:26,720
different kind of a location of a past

1975
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:29,830
segmental it could be located by the

1976
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:31,460
past prior in the PCE or could be by

1977
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:35,780
child oficial

1978
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:37,670
she said and the english instructor we

1979
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:40,040
consider two kinds of scenario the

1980
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:42,050
facility in Terraria ii know i think i

1981
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:43,730
yes it could be pieces in unity

1982
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:48,110
throughout it could be stated for

1983
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:50,570
Casilla hierarchic a PCE scenario next

1984
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:55,460
for this slides away just gave us some

1985
01:48:50,570 --> 01:49:00,080
analysis of the case that is the inter

1986
01:48:55,460 --> 01:49:02,570
area case how it was this this I was

1987
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,730
kidding in the story area together we

1988
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:08,000
just try to use an association work what

1989
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:10,250
was this - sorry I was a few second in

1990
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,389
the together to a former and and I was

1991
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:16,269
he passed

1992
01:49:11,389 --> 01:49:19,939
and next day some into a solution and

1993
01:49:16,269 --> 01:49:21,409
the in this case is a different from the

1994
01:49:19,939 --> 01:49:24,260
previous line in this case I would also

1995
01:49:21,409 --> 01:49:28,749
try to propose to use a stitching

1996
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:33,889
liberals who try to form a end-to-end

1997
01:49:28,749 --> 01:49:36,108
pass with the included into a s pass

1998
01:49:33,889 --> 01:49:40,119
segment and the int sorry

1999
01:49:36,109 --> 01:49:43,639
intro yes and the inter yes it's a

2000
01:49:40,119 --> 01:49:47,688
consisted of a five five of a segment in

2001
01:49:43,639 --> 01:49:50,300
this scenario and this is a this draft

2002
01:49:47,689 --> 01:49:52,039
raises a some give some over real over

2003
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:52,219
the absolution that we want to do by the

2004
01:49:52,039 --> 01:49:55,969
way

2005
01:49:52,219 --> 01:49:57,260
currently we did not give our extension

2006
01:49:55,969 --> 01:50:00,800
that may be needed

2007
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:04,699
they also another companion Java Teresa

2008
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:07,189
is a part of the Association Apogee at

2009
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:12,438
retention which will be present in the

2010
01:50:07,189 --> 01:50:15,499
later and for the next step we sing we

2011
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:18,409
will just to try to give some details

2012
01:50:15,499 --> 01:50:21,559
loose and for the Peace app and and also

2013
01:50:18,409 --> 01:50:29,179
we welcome any comments and discuss it

2014
01:50:21,559 --> 01:50:32,209
yeah a similar question was asked in the

2015
01:50:29,179 --> 01:50:34,399
SR when you presented this in the MPLS

2016
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:36,919
working group that why the path segment

2017
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:38,269
is being used for stitching so I don't

2018
01:50:36,919 --> 01:50:40,369
want you to answer right now but this is

2019
01:50:38,269 --> 01:50:42,469
something that I hope you can discuss in

2020
01:50:40,369 --> 01:50:44,780
spring or MPLS whichever is the right

2021
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:47,149
place and then we can think about doing

2022
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:49,728
this work NPC because our main concern

2023
01:50:47,149 --> 01:50:51,349
is whether this segment should be used

2024
01:50:49,729 --> 01:50:55,129
for stitching itself that needs to be

2025
01:50:51,349 --> 01:50:57,019
clarified before and now I also wear

2026
01:50:55,129 --> 01:50:59,358
there's another similar to awfully

2027
01:50:57,019 --> 01:51:01,699
working over the way have already talked

2028
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:08,070
about also that work try to figure out

2029
01:51:01,699 --> 01:51:23,339
how to proceed next

2030
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:25,950
his good morning everyone my name is

2031
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:28,740
Ching I'm here to discuss RGB extension

2032
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:32,250
for PC EP security capability support in

2033
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:36,000
the PC discovered this job is Aris are

2034
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:38,760
working to adapt and the basic idea is

2035
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,970
so now we have dcpl suppose we have a

2036
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:46,020
TRS supporter we have many different

2037
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:49,440
security capability how to reproduce

2038
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:54,600
these different ability to allow ECE to

2039
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:57,419
company with his PCC so a quick update

2040
01:51:54,600 --> 01:52:01,830
actually this job actually is a DB

2041
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:04,400
extension so that's why it discussed in

2042
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:07,590
the Arisaka kukaku but it also

2043
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:11,339
references our GP extension for PC a

2044
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:14,430
discovery that we developed by the PCE

2045
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:16,320
working cool so for for this job

2046
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:19,470
actually we discussed in a Paris our

2047
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:22,469
working group when during the carpet

2048
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:27,240
option actually summer situations is to

2049
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:29,790
consider to add the tier theory for the

2050
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:32,840
key ID and a key name but to support

2051
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:37,410
that actually we required to update the

2052
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:46,560
obviously fake 50 88 and fifty eighty

2053
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:49,910
nine and so that's actually we make this

2054
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:54,900
change actually and this get adopted in

2055
01:52:49,910 --> 01:53:00,389
last night in November

2056
01:52:54,900 --> 01:53:01,889
ITA meeting in Tucson 18 so here what we

2057
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:05,430
like arrays is we would really want to

2058
01:53:01,890 --> 01:53:08,460
get a feedback from PC would go it was

2059
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:11,790
when we first bring up this draft that

2060
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:13,350
didn't get a lot of Attraction so we do

2061
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:16,230
to the concerns in iOS are but that we

2062
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:18,210
didn't get feedback from the PC so for

2063
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:20,129
the channel will make actually we

2064
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:21,469
require to update of C

2065
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:25,219
58

2066
01:53:21,469 --> 01:53:29,940
89 to allow the advertisement that

2067
01:53:25,219 --> 01:53:36,360
Tara's teacher several theory related to

2068
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:39,870
the security parameter so we have some

2069
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:41,370
feedback from Aris our Minister some

2070
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:45,390
some people really some concern whether

2071
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:47,780
we should advertise this and long RG

2072
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:52,110
period information is may impact the

2073
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:55,739
performance but the the benefited to

2074
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:59,719
allow advertisers kinda capability is

2075
01:53:55,739 --> 01:54:04,739
actually you can really you know

2076
01:53:59,719 --> 01:54:07,590
piggyback some security community to

2077
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:11,928
simplify the operational also we from

2078
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:15,090
also perspective we think actually you

2079
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:18,150
this kind of advertisement only you know

2080
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:20,400
take place out of the initial stage

2081
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:23,639
before you accept you the connection

2082
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:25,160
between PC and PC you so it's not a big

2083
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:29,210
deal actually to impact the performance

2084
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:32,489
so but we'd like to hear the feedback

2085
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:36,630
from a CPC working Co about these kind

2086
01:54:32,489 --> 01:54:40,110
of issues and for the second issue

2087
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:42,570
actually also relate to this first the

2088
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:44,940
issue that because some of people

2089
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:49,620
suggest that maybe we can make it a base

2090
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:53,009
for the FC 50 88 and 89 where them to

2091
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:57,929
write another document to define these

2092
01:54:53,010 --> 01:55:01,920
kind of security support so we we we are

2093
01:54:57,929 --> 01:55:04,860
flexible for these issues and we want to

2094
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:07,290
hear your feedback on this and in a

2095
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:11,610
minute I'm actually you can come out and

2096
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:16,040
right now we can you can come on it is

2097
01:55:11,610 --> 01:55:19,230
so wait we also can follow up how to

2098
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:22,949
deal with these issues so for next step

2099
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:27,059
we will look at all your comments and

2100
01:55:22,949 --> 01:55:29,699
and also to chair we want to make sure

2101
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:33,710
whether these right a placing errors are

2102
01:55:29,699 --> 01:55:33,710
or in PC we can go yeah

2103
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:45,240
comments thank you so so far working on

2104
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:47,920
the external GPS so you make sense

2105
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:49,870
show me from Eastern with the PC working

2106
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,880
group with also for you event so it's

2107
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:53,440
thank for that

2108
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:56,200
back to the issue quickly because we

2109
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:59,620
won't have much time to go over them but

2110
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:01,150
second issue is for me under a set of

2111
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:03,849
rate equation either graph remains in

2112
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:06,700
the working group the way women are

2113
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:09,610
progressing is up to the reserve rule

2114
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:11,590
punchers and for the first question as

2115
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:14,710
far as I remember the limitation about

2116
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:16,570
further extension was imposed by the IGP

2117
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:20,890
your eighty working groups at that time

2118
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:24,070
so if now okay to move this limitation a

2119
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:30,010
scene from the PC standpoint it's pero

2120
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:32,769
to have this restriction removed Thanks

2121
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:46,060
so we move to our last presentation for

2122
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:48,070
today three four minutes thank you as I

2123
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:51,370
mentioned in last apprentice and it's a

2124
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:54,370
companion just that one it's about an

2125
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:57,610
extension to try to solve the interior

2126
01:56:54,370 --> 01:57:00,099
case let's go directly into our case and

2127
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:03,429
here for this case with other propose to

2128
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:05,650
you the associate to try to extend the

2129
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:09,520
Association projector to describe EULA

2130
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:13,990
how to associate this RSP in different

2131
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:16,930
area together and this is a format of

2132
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:18,969
the association with us to use some flag

2133
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:22,210
of the tree indicate the source of

2134
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:25,240
transit and destination Tom I'm going a

2135
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:29,020
little set this is I think this is the

2136
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:31,420
only accessing units document so next

2137
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:34,180
step we'll just want want to request

2138
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:37,620
involve comments and any discuss are you

2139
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:37,620
are welcome thank you

2140
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:45,519
regarding with previous documents I

2141
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:47,770
could write use name a chunk from Hawaii

2142
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:50,980
regarding the previous presentation I

2143
01:57:47,770 --> 01:57:53,830
think it should be a information or

2144
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:57,190
drops because there are nothing to do

2145
01:57:53,830 --> 01:58:03,219
with the extension right and that's it

2146
01:57:57,190 --> 01:58:06,759
yeah eating from Holley cucumbers I

2147
01:58:03,219 --> 01:58:09,610
think that Tibbets for the transmit SB

2148
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:13,030
is not necessary because if an SP

2149
01:58:09,610 --> 01:58:15,910
segment is neither sauce l speak nor

2150
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:21,099
that signature SP it should be always

2151
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:30,210
the chance to meet else peace so I think

2152
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:32,560
that tip it is not necessary I can tell

2153
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:34,810
your comments to my colleague oh and

2154
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:39,160
maybe you can discuss on you meaning is

2155
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:41,410
yeah okay I think this this document

2156
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:43,809
also has the same question about the

2157
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:46,239
path segments and I think the stitching

2158
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:48,700
the association becomes important if you

2159
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:50,440
use part segment so I think that's the

2160
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:54,900
key so for both the documents let's

2161
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:54,900
resolve that and then we can progress

2162
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:03,300
any other business okay see you in

2163
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:03,299
Singapore

2164
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:16,600
[Music]

2165
01:59:49,310 --> 02:00:01,370
okay I would show this to my colleague

2166
01:59:53,179 --> 02:00:01,370
I'm not for me Oh blue sheets people
