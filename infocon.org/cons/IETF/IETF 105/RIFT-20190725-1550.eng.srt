[Music]

3
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,959
[Music]

4
00:02:41,930 --> 00:03:12,780
because because I know how the chairs

5
00:02:44,220 --> 00:03:15,500
are - very well - JPS work with him

6
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,500
listen now

7
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,150
[Laughter]

8
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:35,420
oh lucky me

9
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:16,010
Tony it's not here Tony

10
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:59,659
you can just start to know okay so we

11
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:06,620
are going to get started now blue sheets

12
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:09,860
is circulating now in sign not well it's

13
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,169
not well if you're have not read it

14
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,870
before read it

15
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:17,020
we already got a note-taker sandy thank

16
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,020
you

17
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:25,639
Jeff is going to be the Shepherd scribe

18
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,940
we have a simple agenda today we have

19
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,789
three presentations so we'll just get

20
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,770
started on that and at the end we'll

21
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,370
talk about the working group status and

22
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,370
the plan

23
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,520
so Tony are you ready

24
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:19,350
Crysta pushy pushy it's almost like a

25
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,039
where any cool so hey everyone I'm just

26
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:26,600
giving you an update what was going on

27
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,480
between the last two idf's we are at

28
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,340
version six and I think after this the

29
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:38,580
seven will be coming after ITF and will

30
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,140
be pretty much raft so we Wow can I

31
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,280
really nice oh yeah I can you probably

32
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,960
can't so we published six on the key

33
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,929
three points to seven and doesn't change

34
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,669
you since the five and they mostly came

35
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,390
from Bruno having implemented a bunch of

36
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:57,210
things and discovered that a couple of

37
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:01,590
things are still unclear all right so we

38
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,270
had this v4 v6 thingy going on so there

39
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,250
was also discussion on the lease rocket

40
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,109
that would have been brought up by three

41
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,910
or four four different people

42
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:17,310
alvaro originally as well and we had two

43
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,810
out two or three clarifications and we

44
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,970
had to omit something from the draft

45
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:27,210
okay so first when Bruno was sending v4

46
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,790
v6 right when he switched off an address

47
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,489
family he stopped sending it but he was

48
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:35,370
still processing the received frames so

49
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:39,150
it led to an answer network adjacency so

50
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,740
we had to add it to the draft that sorry

51
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,590
it was the other way around

52
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,900
when he switched off the AF he stopped

53
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,780
receiving it but you're still sending it

54
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,299
so my side I had bought AFS and here on

55
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,429
each side and only one AF support so we

56
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,540
had to add clarification I thought it

57
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:01,229
was obvious that a note that is not

58
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,889
receiving frames in an address family

59
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:09,669
lies hellos

60
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:11,439
also not send them okay then we had

61
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,240
discussion in the security envelope

62
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:19,810
because we implemented the full security

63
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:22,539
envelope and interrupt it so it wasn't

64
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,879
clear that you can look behind the

65
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:27,460
security envelope and use the fields

66
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,590
before you validated the fingerprint

67
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,799
that are enveloping them in protecting

68
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,870
them subtle thing we had to basically

69
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,510
extend the spec by saying that you must

70
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:42,820
not access any value until you validated

71
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:45,550
the fingerprint okay then we had to

72
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,890
denounce wrap up on the security

73
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,979
envelope or basically the notes goes up

74
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,990
up up up and he can wrap around

75
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,350
generating a zero and the value zero

76
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,620
also is an undefined nonce so we did not

77
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,390
see that that would drop adjacency but

78
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,190
just to be better safe than sorry we

79
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,779
added on that when their notes is

80
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,579
wrapping up and you hit the zero you

81
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:12,089
automatically has to jump to define

82
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:15,370
value one okay then we had this

83
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:19,589
interesting case where we saying that it

84
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:23,890
on unless you in l3 in a threeway state

85
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:27,279
you must send just zeros as nonces

86
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,839
undefined I only buy new in 3-way State

87
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
you start to mirror each other's

88
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,709
nonsense

89
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,019
now the problem is that if you decide in

90
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:39,579
a threeway state to reset the adjacency

91
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,500
the original spec was saying that you

92
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,779
basically start to send zeros right

93
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,480
because you must send zeros and that's

94
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:48,699
how the state how the spec remains the

95
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,440
spec was correct but it leads to the

96
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,229
fact that the guy on the other side has

97
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,620
to wait until he times out because

98
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,740
you're sending him Elwha one way or two

99
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,890
way with all zeros which he will ignore

100
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,070
because the spec says that's in three

101
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,199
way you must ignore one way into way

102
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,620
lies otherwise you could build a very

103
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:16,060
simple attack to research essences so as

104
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,780
an optimization we allow that you may

105
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,369
send

106
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,860
one one way or two way lie with the

107
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,840
nonces you know because you're coming

108
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,670
down from three ways so coming down for

109
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,560
three way and you really want to reset

110
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,199
your Jess each other on the other side

111
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,359
fast and the only way you manage that is

112
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,030
if you show the guy correct nonces on

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,190
the one way or two way so you're allowed

114
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,990
to do that once or twice we're basically

115
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,630
says an optimization you may do that

116
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,450
which will allow you from a three way to

117
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,610
reset the remote guy sending a one-way

118
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,940
with the correct Nazis once before you

119
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,330
reset them to zero does it sound need to

120
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,220
pick you well that is a full fledge

121
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,750
interrupt behind after two people

122
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,280
implemented without talking to each

123
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:05,830
other all right then we had something on

124
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:18,339
the life times we softened up two

125
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:21,910
lifetimes alright so basically we had

126
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,540
this rounding up of life times to

127
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,339
prevent a generation of fingerprints and

128
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,040
we need to talk through the stuff we

129
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:31,390
realize it actually doesn't buy you much

130
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,819
when the non C's advanced very

131
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:40,199
aggressively so we weaken it from a

132
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:43,990
shoot to an A okay then what we did this

133
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,300
we added a couple of optional things to

134
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,190
the schema so the first thing is and

135
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,439
that was demand from a customer actually

136
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:54,670
looking how they would deploy that was

137
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,760
that we added into this when we sending

138
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:01,000
out the note ties with the description

139
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,390
of the adjacencies we added in whether

140
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,240
the essence is protected by a key outer

141
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,939
key which means the Llano the the

142
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,800
pairwise key and the reason was that the

143
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,210
customer wanted to look at the top of

144
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,819
the fabric where they see the whole

145
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,589
fabric right you have the topology the

146
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,040
full topology at the top of the of the

147
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:24,010
fabric and just like we have nice

148
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,230
gambling they wanted to see whether the

149
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,819
fabric is secure generally I was very

150
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,050
surprised the security is actually

151
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,050
general generating

152
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,230
astonish lehigh interest rates I thought

153
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,670
they will be like one of these thing we

154
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,010
must do because we're like a modern

155
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,360
protocol but the discussion how to

156
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,970
secure fabric rollover keys is actually

157
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,860
evoking a lot of interest by a lot I

158
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,320
mean two three large customers really

159
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,660
wanted to know what we want the model is

160
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,220
and there was a direct direct output

161
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,719
they basically want to look at the top

162
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,890
of the fabric understand whether they

163
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,610
have all the links on the fabric

164
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:09,699
protected right it trusted the other

165
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,320
feedback that was from again deployment

166
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,060
and doing all kind of things already

167
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,460
like how would i hook up my controller

168
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:19,599
and do all kind of funky stuff on the

169
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,790
prefix we have optional see them as flex

170
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,800
because the boolean one is telling you

171
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,390
whether the prefix is a loopback and the

172
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,579
other whether it's directly attached to

173
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,620
you right so that way you can say

174
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,930
whether it shows up from some funky

175
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,800
place but some funky means injected by

176
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,750
controller or something simple stuff

177
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:43,740
optional didn't even increment the

178
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:47,589
schema that's all no we had more stuff

179
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:51,400
all right and and there was a discussion

180
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:54,460
of the router requirements so there was

181
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,350
one more I didn't put on the thing also

182
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,089
an optional element but it escapes you

183
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,070
but then we had a discussion where we

184
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:05,860
said a rift router may support a v6 but

185
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,220
must support v4 oh yeah and that that

186
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,860
was why the addition was necessary and

187
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:15,250
and objection just to finally saw was

188
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,020
that before we all pushed hard to

189
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,270
obsolete before right so that way it

190
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,250
will never go away on the other hand the

191
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,199
v6 is nowhere close where people will be

192
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,839
able everyone will run the v6 pure

193
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,620
fabric good a lot of people do but we're

194
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,820
by far not there yet so after and the

195
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,190
reasoning was the following that if a

196
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,320
fabric does not have any v4 addresses

197
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,780
which is highly desirable the only thing

198
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,990
you get on v6 address is nd coming up

199
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:47,350
right once you have two v6

200
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,280
and you exchanged the v6 lies because

201
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,260
you can send v4 lives so no v4 addresses

202
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,209
if you imply that you can be for forward

203
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,340
which is absolutely possible right

204
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,350
because you have to Gateway resolution

205
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,030
well you don't need to get or you have

206
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,790
to make a trip MAC address right nd

207
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:07,150
gives you the binding the MEC binding to

208
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,360
the Gateway so you can very fine forward

209
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,980
before you get a v4 frame yes you don't

210
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,320
have a v4 gateway but the only thing is

211
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,880
a MAC address so you just go to the v6

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,290
and you just get the Mac stick to Mac

213
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,910
and forward works like a charm

214
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:23,380
no tunneling no special configuration so

215
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,689
works beautifully but of course you must

216
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,210
assume that the guys cable go forward in

217
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,570
v4 so you don't black hole so once you

218
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:35,170
remove this requirement that goes away

219
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:37,360
so what we do on the lies now on the

220
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:40,810
hellos you must indicate order your

221
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,730
support v4 forwarding and that that way

222
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,550
I know whether you will black hole my v4

223
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,400
frame or not the intention is of course

224
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,930
not to support rear deployments where

225
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,880
people will start to build fabric

226
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,780
partially forwarding v4 and partially

227
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,939
not and computing partial SPS the spec

228
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,400
will allow you to do that but that

229
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,190
that's not the red hole right

230
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,840
so that way we allow people to build v4

231
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,240
and reliably understand that the v4

232
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,870
foreing will work albeit they have no v4

233
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,560
addressing right while allowing easily

234
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,710
to migrate to pure v6 so that's not as

235
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,689
convenient for the customer but I see

236
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,960
how we net cannot put out a spec saying

237
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,110
it must arouse running this must support

238
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:30,220
v4 and there was a confusion for a beach

239
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:35,590
where people were thinking that thus

240
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:38,050
that implies that zod based on the

241
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:41,590
Charter we must support both address

242
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:44,920
family and expect us that any

243
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:47,170
combination so the sentence was related

244
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,030
to router requirements if you want to

245
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,939
deploy such a protocol so this sentence

246
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:55,000
is gone and we have a new information

247
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,360
element indicated in ipv4 40 so it is

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,040
tedious but this is no really

249
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,989
like grinding it to the point where

250
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,459
people trying to switch the star once a

251
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:05,220
house that's supposed to work and we

252
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:07,740
have to implementation really you know

253
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,019
having stressing all kind of weird

254
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:15,329
corner conditions on the protocol all

255
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:17,250
right so we had a full implementation of

256
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,859
security envelope on the open source and

257
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,669
my site and we had a full interrupt now

258
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,428
finished

259
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,659
so that's result so Bruno I have Bruno's

260
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,819
presentation which is a lot of

261
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:30,029
interesting things that we hit but

262
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:34,408
basically the Python reef has a full

263
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:36,779
implementation of the single plane we

264
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:39,450
have to since a bit and we'll be

265
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,789
releasing the staff and already with the

266
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,610
0-7 draft implementation which means all

267
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:46,559
the I'll talk about what will come in to

268
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:50,178
zero sevens all those changes plus some

269
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,039
more the security envelope

270
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,919
interoperability is finished so we have

271
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,929
the done we will be releasing to zero

272
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,700
eleven juniper which is basically a full

273
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,799
implementation and it will be releasing

274
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,750
in public dome the for public

275
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:07,799
consumption because when we really is a

276
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,389
binary package we'll be releasing a much

277
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,960
wider envelope that we were already

278
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:15,209
giving actually to customers which

279
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,769
includes a thrift API allowing a full

280
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,740
configuration of the protocol during

281
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:22,799
runtime and the full operational state

282
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,200
API as a thrift services as well as

283
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,418
real-time analytics API we're basically

284
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,429
writing real time to hold database and a

285
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,830
lot of operational state of the protocol

286
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:35,580
and already start abase and we're also

287
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:38,010
including open source library which

288
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,379
allows to deserialize

289
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,679
all those stuff we've writing the

290
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,100
analytics from the ready starter base

291
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,309
real time good comment from bruna on

292
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,500
jabber yeah on slide till it is actually

293
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,418
safe to reject a packet based and field

294
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:00,019
after the finger before validation to

295
00:18:54,419 --> 00:19:04,380
fingerprint if you go to selection only

296
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:06,179
yes but there is no need on unless we we

297
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,130
would do what preneur suggests and i

298
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,470
rejected which is protecting something

299
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,860
like rift major because i see absolutely

300
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,600
not

301
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,250
but then you would look before the

302
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,689
fingerprint right now there is nothing

303
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,620
if you look before fingerprint that

304
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,000
makes any sense

305
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:24,600
well sorry nonces no let me read it okay

306
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,149
for example it is safe and efficient to

307
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,010
reject a packet because of out of French

308
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:31,408
nuns before validating the fingerprint

309
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,330
however if you have accept a packet you

310
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:36,720
must validate in the print before taking

311
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,809
any print collection okay so that may

312
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,779
still need a small grind because Brewers

313
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:45,090
absolutely correct you can and shoot

314
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,710
look at the nonces before the

315
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,019
fingerprint because that you can reject

316
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,409
it without being exposed a computational

317
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:55,409
attack because there the fingerprint

318
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:58,080
computation is an envelope where if

319
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,880
someone forces you to compute a lot of

320
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,720
envelope damages basically have a

321
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,850
denial-of-service attack surface against

322
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,470
your computational resources so Bruna is

323
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,570
correct we have that in two minutes

324
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,190
who's taking the minutes because I do

325
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,428
not want to miss that

326
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:18,529
please Bruna will continue on mailing

327
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,529
lifts yes

328
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:41,429
there is actually five four nine things

329
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:49,229
all that link

330
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't think because Ted was when I was

331
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,179
looking for I was only finding the 7

332
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,990
series which was all about tunneling ok

333
00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:01,649
excellent please do poke me reference

334
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:04,500
this document absolutely as well the

335
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:06,449
text is not explained that now the

336
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,389
router requirements were kind making it

337
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,250
implicit right but it would be great to

338
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:13,500
have two five serious reference where we

339
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,240
basically don't even have to explain how

340
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,220
you do it okay yeah because because I

341
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,809
refuse to put into a respect like I'm

342
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,549
not here to describe how to build a

343
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,320
forwarding path right so this was

344
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:28,639
specifically to avoid just attack

345
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:32,720
sorry to the previous person just

346
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,940
freakin yeah yeah okay hope people can

347
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,800
follow that once implementing can do

348
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,740
that for sure

349
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:43,040
all right so back to that so that will

350
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,440
be out in probably two three weeks

351
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,889
starts already but as usual the wheels

352
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,220
need grinding then we went through the

353
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:55,610
early Directorate reviews already got

354
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,970
you know for three hours worth of

355
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:01,580
sitting around and cleaning the stuff up

356
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:04,490
so like I said the router requirements

357
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:07,460
for if discussion has been had and we

358
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,380
removed the router requirements will be

359
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,210
gone completely zero seven and we added

360
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,260
a indication whether v4 forwarding is is

361
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:21,470
supported

362
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:23,450
lots of editorial better wording I sent

363
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,610
a stuff out today to the mail English

364
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:29,090
with a result what we do most know

365
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:33,820
except that um that will go all in to

366
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:36,590
0-7 and that's it from my side

367
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:39,080
so then Bruno's usually put me on the

368
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:48,320
spot you know he's having fun I have to

369
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:52,689
talk questions not only safe Lots people

370
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:58,300
already on the plane alright so this is

371
00:22:52,690 --> 00:23:01,430
the whole output of the interrupts stuff

372
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:05,530
okay alright

373
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:08,780
the usual location Python reference

374
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:14,149
implementation not associated when event

375
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:16,910
or no bribes accepted almost there all

376
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,860
right so since 104 Bruno implemented a

377
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,290
very good chunk of it so he implemented

378
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,659
the positive disaggregation he

379
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,700
implemented and actually very well debug

380
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,800
the flood reduction so he put a very

381
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,020
nice document explaining how flaw

382
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,360
reduction works and the properties is

383
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,710
the Chiefs in rift good reading

384
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,409
generally very interested in flood

385
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,480
reduction and house

386
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,790
during implementation we went in and we

387
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,310
interrupt the staff and he put actually

388
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:48,330
so he had the security analogy so he

389
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:50,639
rafted up he has the security review

390
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,320
report in even more excruciating details

391
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,690
with all the possible attacks whatever

392
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,780
we imagine actually a very good comment

393
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,900
came in that we are probably at a

394
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,280
sentence on the security section

395
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,410
specifically for the host requirements

396
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,300
because now we're talking about protocol

397
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,310
which can extend all the way the routing

398
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,840
domain into the host which is about the

399
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:17,399
first time something like that is being

400
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:19,409
done and the discussion was around the

401
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,000
fact that the host is of course much

402
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,100
more like are we talking datacenter

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,770
server is much more likely to be

404
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:33,050
compromised what kind of attack envelope

405
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:36,080
that could present against the fabric so

406
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:38,310
the output is not nothing particularly

407
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,990
exciting you basically have to own the

408
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,730
host either have a very strict rate

409
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:46,320
limiting how much state you push into

410
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:48,840
the protocol or end on the tour you have

411
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,389
strict limit how much state you're

412
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,040
willing to take up from a host in terms

413
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,740
of all of us on someone showing you a

414
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,700
million kubernetes prefixes probably not

415
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,370
a good idea all right

416
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,220
or they try to pretend there's a million

417
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:04,469
people behind them which if you deploy

418
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,570
that with the leaf flag is not possible

419
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,120
but let's say you do a full ztp and

420
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,370
someone could try to build an artificial

421
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,590
topology and inject it into you at the

422
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:21,750
tour ok so what is still not in the

423
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:26,250
pirate Python multiplying with negative

424
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:29,370
desegregation frankly there are very few

425
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:32,070
people in the world at large scale who

426
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:34,050
have the luxury to run about a plane but

427
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,730
are people who are now multiplying it of

428
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:40,260
the very cheap end of the spectrum

429
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:42,690
surprisingly enough so- this application

430
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,610
east-west links is are not implemented

431
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,700
multi neighbor state which is the

432
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,810
extension to the FSM we did when

433
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,929
multiple people show up on the same

434
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,270
Ethernet right which is a mystic 8 link

435
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:57,179
key Valley which is optional policy be

436
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,639
guided which is optional Oh Brewer

437
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,580
cannot set your bit clock comparison

438
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,980
which is the specific extension for

439
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,309
mobility on the fabric if you want fast

440
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,080
mobility on the fabric which if you

441
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:13,230
don't support is just fine you advertise

442
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,760
without clock fabric bandwidth balancing

443
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:19,160
which is the computation where you bend

444
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,990
with balance

445
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:26,460
northbound which given that he's running

446
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:28,770
on Linux I do not know he well I do not

447
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,640
think that Linux is any kind of support

448
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:34,530
for for next hops which are unequal so

449
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,010
there is seeing people in unequal weight

450
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,870
but I would have to double-check nor

451
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:44,129
test cases so he's always adding test

452
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:45,840
case and we do not look at the label

453
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,980
binding segment routing this Pony time

454
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,449
sing clip simply no demand be ft because

455
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,190
Linux doesn't have anything so the best

456
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,990
you can do is probably reflecting from

457
00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:00,059
the tour so multicast is kind of open

458
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,860
discussion first color probably talk

459
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:05,610
about what is stand with the multicast

460
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:08,149
or maybe Jeffrey and no plan to support

461
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:12,510
engraved Python the end data model

462
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:14,160
alright so positive dissipation I don't

463
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,350
want to explain necessarily again how

464
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:26,040
positive desegregation works but

465
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:30,000
basically when look at this okay so when

466
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,220
spine one loses a link to a leaf that's

467
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,460
the simplest case they're basically spy

468
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,400
1/2 and 1/3 have to show the specifics

469
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,820
of the lead leaf 1 1 so this guy doesn't

470
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,070
like college so they are accepted to the

471
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:51,480
default the adds the desegregation of

472
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:53,460
these leaf 1:1 routes only ok yeah so

473
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,220
that's basically the scenario 1 2 and

474
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,020
1/3 show amount specific and all the

475
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,510
traffic towards leaf 1 1 is being

476
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,800
offloaded or 4 of the spine 1 1 which

477
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,400
would black hole it

478
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,840
and that as we know that it's

479
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,000
non-transitive so if you have a level

480
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,760
about the needs to disaggregated this

481
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
aggregation does not flow south it's

482
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,120
unnecessary as a multiple levels and

483
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,710
multiple parts of the fabric made easy

484
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,810
Brigade at the same time if you have

485
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,360
multiple failures until you're

486
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,850
guaranteed not to black hole and not

487
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,290
physically on a problem to bowtie

488
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,709
through the fabric because these guys

489
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:36,310
could go like this up like this and come

490
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,480
down which in fact can happen if those

491
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,950
guys are in process of these

492
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,900
applications or these guys may black

493
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,630
hole depending how much connectivity has

494
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,920
or timo count it up and end up bow tying

495
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:50,950
through the fabric which is also highly

496
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,600
undesirable condition when people

497
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,100
running those fabrics from experience

498
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,560
because of course it had but no

499
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,780
completely breaks any of your blocking

500
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:07,169
probabilities that you laid out the

501
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:10,740
fabric for all right so as usual

502
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:13,150
well-written pros know very easily

503
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,490
understandable narrative what is all

504
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,020
about and how to go into it is reference

505
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,970
implementation which can dump you all

506
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,160
the states show you what is happening

507
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,050
you know it's excellent to learn how the

508
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,720
protocol works to walk through these

509
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:30,040
kind of feature guides that Bruno is

510
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,900
putting out it's always enabled and we

511
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,060
know the algorithm is you detect the

512
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,280
black hole you trigger that is

513
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,620
aggregation as much as you need to

514
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,389
prevent black holes you advertise the

515
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,909
soft southbound so the desegregation

516
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,590
always go south just as negative if you

517
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,930
never desegregate at the top of the

518
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:54,070
fabric and you install the most specific

519
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:55,810
in the table all right so here we go he

520
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,790
looks at what are the southbound

521
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,110
adjacencies and based on all the

522
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,930
reflection that you get from other

523
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:04,060
people you know what you're not having

524
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:07,120
compared to the people at the same level

525
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:09,040
so people at same level these are north

526
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,530
urgency there's a suffragist since you

527
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:16,149
realize okay I'm missing the adjacency

528
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:18,070
here and then Bruno has all kind of

529
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,330
you know like interface states where he

530
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,490
can tell you you know look there's

531
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,189
people who are forcing me to be

532
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:27,460
partially connected on this interface

533
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:30,180
because this or running actually not in

534
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,420
containers is running on namespaces and

535
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:39,940
then your trigger you know positive

536
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:42,970
disaggregate which is this then the

537
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,470
stuff gets flooded so this is you see

538
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,060
the link state database right which

539
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,890
direction do we flat who is the

540
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,629
originator what is the type is supposed

541
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,210
to give disaggregated prefix because the

542
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:57,250
tie are all annotated and you see what's

543
00:30:52,210 --> 00:31:00,040
inside and which metric and this will be

544
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,900
the SPF that you run on it so those are

545
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,909
results of the SPF as far as I remember

546
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,710
and it shows you that it also speaking

547
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,230
up beside the defaults that go through

548
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,690
get the three gateways you're peeking a

549
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,600
desegregated goes for two gateways at a

550
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:18,310
different cost and you had those are the

551
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,530
interfaces again and this is the routing

552
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,780
table so that's the rip all tie broken

553
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,370
and so on you see where who installed

554
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,830
the stuff and again what are the routes

555
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:31,959
and you're only see the gateways flood

556
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:36,970
reduction so why flood reduction is

557
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:40,690
because obviously when you flood in this

558
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:43,240
scenario every level that floods up you

559
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,890
get an enormous amount of copies from

560
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,390
coming from the bottom which is all

561
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:54,720
exactly the same information and we

562
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:58,120
talking right now easily 64 128 256

563
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,390
fan-out so radix which means 128 down

564
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,229
128 up something like that maybe 64 up

565
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,370
96 down people have different ratios

566
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,250
right so basically you get overwhelmed

567
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,870
right you could both overwhelmed in

568
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,520
terms of how much you have to replicate

569
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,709
and you also get overwhelmed but simply

570
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,580
when the in caste that you see no matter

571
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,590
how fast you're flat you flood all right

572
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,300
so basically what we would like is

573
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,429
somehow to limit number of copies that

574
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,909
we're getting into some kind of a safe

575
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:29,570
number right that will not partition

576
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,400
when we lose some links

577
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,710
give us a march in safety but on the

578
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,260
other hand not burden us with excessive

579
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,510
amount so what the rest construct is

580
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,250
basically okay so this is an example

581
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,230
what happens when the rat and the green

582
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,210
guy starts to flop when everything is

583
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,370
fully connected the rat node would

584
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,220
generate four copies the four copies

585
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:52,280
will hit super one this leaf will do the

586
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:55,420
same thing red and green topology which

587
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:59,120
basically leads to four identical copies

588
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:02,090
going through the fabric and again with

589
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,459
four doesn't seem excessive 64 is

590
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,830
nothing special right as a radix year or

591
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:12,280
even 1632 these things add up very

592
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:18,169
quickly so what we really want is

593
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:20,840
somehow out of this four prune out to be

594
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:23,330
so let's assume we're happy with two

595
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,720
copies which is a good number normally

596
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,490
so instead of so of course we have to

597
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,050
flock to all those four guys because

598
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,880
each of them needs the information of

599
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:34,399
the road right now so there's nothing to

600
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,700
reduce here but from here on what we

601
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:41,150
like is that only two of the spines and

602
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:44,210
the copy to the super spine right and a

603
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:47,420
very subtle problem that starts to

604
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:52,220
emerge is that if everybody down here

605
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:56,060
picks up the two same guys then you have

606
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:58,520
no the problem that those guys may get

607
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,550
completely overrun with the replication

608
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,800
plus you know processing of the stuff

609
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,899
well absorption and then of course

610
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:11,330
making sure that the flooding went

611
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:13,520
through so ideally we want each of these

612
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:16,159
guys pick up two different guys is

613
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,139
although we load balanced and of course

614
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,940
we don't want to synchronize those guys

615
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,520
again because we don't have any

616
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,130
reflection beliefs are not even aware

617
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,259
how how many of them are at ease level

618
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:31,310
that's how you scale this stuff up so

619
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:36,350
non-trivial to achieve went through a

620
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:39,770
couple of iterations and solution final

621
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:42,730
emerging solution largely based on

622
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,730
Pascal thinking

623
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,040
feature guide' again this one I really

624
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:49,799
highly recommend it works you very

625
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,080
carefully again we'd like all the seal

626
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,720
eyes and so on I don't know what it will

627
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,150
not drop theorizing into this this one

628
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,770
will see but it's a nice English

629
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:04,140
narrative explaining to you how you

630
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:06,180
achieve such a thing right and what

631
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,890
happens is basically is that those nodes

632
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,830
running kind of an election are going

633
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:13,230
distribute to the election are great so

634
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:15,930
each of them Peaks to write and the

635
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,820
algorithm is run in a way that's based

636
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:21,060
on their note ID and these note ID

637
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,150
everybody ends up with a pretty nice you

638
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,529
know spreading it evenly the story gets

639
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,840
more interesting of course if

640
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,660
connectivity is partial because you have

641
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,370
to pick up possibly more than two to get

642
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,379
a double coverage at the top of the

643
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,819
fabric or the next level up right so

644
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,520
things get a little bit more interesting

645
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,540
very quickly if you consider partial

646
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,360
connectivity so wrist Python exams annex

647
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,160
implements an example algorithm and the

648
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,770
funny thing is that if you three think

649
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,379
farther each of these nodes can actually

650
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,240
pick a different algorithm if they

651
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,280
choose without the endangering the whole

652
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,250
thing very much so that's a surprising

653
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,710
property so he implements we gave a nice

654
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,930
algorithm that has a lot of entropy if

655
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,360
everybody runs it it will spread nicely

656
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,129
but it is a very very resilient if you

657
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,440
trying to do something slightly funky

658
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,090
and you do other choices unless

659
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,340
everybody's really stupid and picked the

660
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,320
first in the second then like well okay

661
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:21,110
right you have no entropy you know the

662
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:24,600
ID has to somehow get into the entropy

663
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:28,410
so this whole show comments is on his

664
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,360
implementation okay so he even included

665
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,850
something so when you look at the flood

666
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,710
reduction what you find is you have an

667
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,470
interface and you're talking to someone

668
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,500
obviously that's the system ID on some

669
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,450
interface and you know how many

670
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,480
grandparents he has because that's what

671
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,640
you get on his node tie you see that

672
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,980
even if yourself all the adjustments are

673
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,870
included and you know which is north or

674
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,970
south so you know he has four

675
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,480
grandparents and here is their normally

676
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,549
right this guy has one which means

677
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,840
that he lost three links so you have to

678
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:04,119
account for that this I will never not

679
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,950
even talk about we basically put this

680
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,630
thing into equivalence group so we say

681
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,759
all those three guys are actually

682
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:13,540
equally good when you choose them and

683
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,090
then we mix them up we run like a mixer

684
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,279
so those are gonna code hash groups I

685
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,470
forgot what we call them it's used for

686
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,940
the Fisher Fisher Yates type of hashes

687
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:26,770
and what happens at the end after they

688
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,050
are ordered in these equivalent and

689
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:32,560
movement and meshed up you basically

690
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:35,770
start to pick them and you assign them

691
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,770
as a flat repeater which means we signal

692
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:42,130
to them if you see my originator tie to

693
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:44,500
please repeat to a level above I did you

694
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,600
say Falls means I'm sending in my

695
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,869
information please do not keep repeating

696
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,250
it the whole thing is actually vaguely

697
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:55,330
similar to money

698
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:57,100
flood reduction right which worked very

699
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,140
well but we couldn't use directly

700
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,060
because they take advantage as far as I

701
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,259
remember very heavily from the fact that

702
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:07,810
their wireless medium is broadcast which

703
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:10,540
we don't have right our our medium is

704
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:14,529
the opposite of broadcast actually we

705
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:19,090
have link to link everywhere okay so

706
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:21,100
then what you can also see from Bruno's

707
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,600
cody's when you look at the grandparents

708
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,560
which means top the parents but the

709
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,180
grandparents you can actually see

710
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,500
whether they've redundantly covered

711
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,230
which means do they have at least a

712
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,150
degree of - over off of replication

713
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,220
right so one link and I'll break it and

714
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,960
then you have to you know figure

715
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,368
everything out and wait until you figure

716
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,780
out the front row reduction and then go

717
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:43,180
flat until you have everything

718
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,160
everywhere so it's resilient and again

719
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,930
the degrees up to your choosing and

720
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,089
actually every leaf every node can

721
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,649
choose their own degree one can run wait

722
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,359
I need double coverage there that

723
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:59,340
certain three coverage doesn't matter

724
00:38:52,359 --> 00:39:00,600
nothing changing and let's probably look

725
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,550
from the other side where you see

726
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,100
whether you are the flood repeater for

727
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,870
the guy on the other side tons of stuff

728
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,370
you see that's basically digesting these

729
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,080
metrics right watch the neighbor state

730
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:15,529
are you which direction is the neighbor

731
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:19,470
what's his system ID interface which is

732
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:21,570
we think that people appreciate a lot

733
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,819
when they debug those fun fabrics and

734
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,980
it's like trivial thing but it's very

735
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,260
hard to do a traditional protocols it's

736
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,300
very easy to see whom you're talking to

737
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,220
on the other side so you have to name

738
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,990
off the guy right you know who it is but

739
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,240
not only this you you see his interface

740
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,189
name it's very easy to go right over

741
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,819
okay i hook up into this guide on this

742
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,680
port so that's what ref gives you right

743
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,900
you always know when I'm going out and

744
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,589
who MIDI i hook up on which interface

745
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,560
when I'm cabling alright so you can

746
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:57,450
disable that of course you know but it's

747
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,040
enabled by default and I think Brunel

748
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,490
allows you to play with a redundancy

749
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,450
factor and the similarity factor is

750
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:08,009
that's how you balance depending on how

751
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,230
many edges the guy said not wrong

752
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,460
because you can have different

753
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,080
strategies when you pick who is

754
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,540
repeating for you right you can pick up

755
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,740
the guy with most of this is not found

756
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,960
because he gives you the highest

757
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,450
coverage you can just do the opposite

758
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,450
you can pick up one with the least right

759
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,509
because he will repeat the fastest right

760
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:30,629
or the guy who has the most CP or

761
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,820
whatever not it really doesn't like I

762
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,460
said it's highly resilient as long as

763
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,740
you put you knows ID essential P into

764
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:42,570
the whole algorithm the staff will

765
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:46,020
spread you know depending how it really

766
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,460
doesn't matter it's bloody resilient as

767
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,640
long as you put a little bit entropy the

768
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,150
stuff just slow balances all right all

769
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,569
right

770
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,160
security so now here comes the most

771
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:59,370
delicate part of the work or what

772
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,500
happened ok so again here comes Bruno

773
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,390
nothing until it's like in beautiful

774
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,610
English write down everybody can follow

775
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,799
and learn from so truly a reference

776
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:10,800
implementation in the in to really the

777
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,630
best sense of the work so we have two

778
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,580
outer keys per interface right

779
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,980
protect are not showing in the law where

780
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,450
we protect twice we do origin protection

781
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,960
which means when I'm originating

782
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:24,720
information I am putting my key

783
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,290
signature around that which means the

784
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,330
content cannot be changed but then when

785
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,580
I break up an adjacency I have the

786
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,950
option it's all optional I know everyone

787
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,660
without keys fine I have the option to

788
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:41,939
only accept adjacency if we agree on

789
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:46,049
fingerprint of a key non acceptable key

790
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,970
and in every packet when it's a tyent's

791
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:50,730
in a protect that gets wrapped into the

792
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,379
outer one right on every adjacency we

793
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,090
have an outer key which is suggesting

794
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,880
specific if you want and we have the

795
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,040
inner key which is really signed by the

796
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,050
originator of the information which is

797
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,410
really only of interest if you write if

798
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:06,330
you if you do a less piece theis lsas

799
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:11,490
right the stuff that slots all over the

800
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:12,299
place so right so we call them inner

801
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,549
keys

802
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,170
Bruno tried to pushed into Thai origin

803
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,540
keys but actually we can protect more

804
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,610
stuff like PS and PS right tire kites

805
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,170
also with this key so it's not clear

806
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,270
what will happens I prefer to call them

807
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:28,050
inner key right it's the originator

808
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:30,750
protection of course multiple algorithms

809
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,790
because we show the key and then we show

810
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:37,260
what is the fingerprint length that we

811
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:38,009
use right now we are running off run or

812
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,310
correct me

813
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:42,750
I think char to 256 which looked to me

814
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,549
like the sweet spot I think there was

815
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:50,040
some discussion on the list why we pick

816
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:53,010
the key 512 and of big-ish so I think

817
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,509
I'm running off sha-512 or 256 III I

818
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,800
don't remember which is agreed on

819
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,510
something and then you need library

820
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,980
support for all the languages and it has

821
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:05,250
to be honest say this or the other we

822
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:07,050
have support for key rollover and then

823
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,780
of course you know statistic logging

824
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,560
because one security fails it is hell to

825
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,370
debug because the answer is basically no

826
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:22,170
okay why is not very good with security

827
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:24,390
right how to find out so we have this mo

828
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,220
file which describes it Apollo you use

829
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,259
to interact because we both

830
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,240
bring up his virtual topologies writing

831
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,950
we can read the same format to see the

832
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,868
topology description without running a

833
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,810
lot of virtual machines or whatever or

834
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:39,710
not so we added all kind of things where

835
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:42,660
you have to describe the keys and each

836
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,609
note can say right so what is the my

837
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,580
origin authentication key that I'm using

838
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:49,460
which one will I accept and what am i

839
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,170
running pay interface what is my active

840
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,910
dedication key on the interface and what

841
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:59,730
is the accepted keys on this interface I

842
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:01,589
have more staff which Bruno does not

843
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,420
support which is all kind of strategies

844
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,760
what I'll do with the key if it shows up

845
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,130
which is in in practical deployment very

846
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,200
useful there's no or kind of lose

847
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,609
permissive thing which says like if you

848
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,069
don't have the keys okay if you have a

849
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:17,609
key are verified otherwise I'm ok you

850
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:19,800
know all kind of variations that has

851
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:22,109
evolved over last 20 years and though

852
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,810
our SPF nice eyes nicely led the way

853
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:27,390
right so this very sophisticated

854
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:30,750
limitations all right so when you look

855
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:34,230
at the security of an interface so that

856
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,220
has proven necessary right honey yeah of

857
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,460
comments from Bruna

858
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:42,118
so Linux does support a net cost multi

859
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:44,970
path and the TIFIA society 56 zone leads

860
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,710
to 56 wonderful and we do have to

861
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,689
support in Linux which means if you get

862
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,550
that as a host version you will actually

863
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:54,510
see that it will load balance based on

864
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:55,920
bandwidth on the fabric not about if

865
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,290
it's correctly implemented so it

866
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,180
balances the suggested order and again

867
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,740
it doesn't matter how it balances every

868
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,330
leaf can do what they want because it's

869
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,709
a loop free algorithm it's very free

870
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:09,660
right so you send it any any way you

871
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,990
like it will not loop on your fabric

872
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,910
will get there but if you have one

873
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:17,700
metric you probably wants to mesh

874
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,319
something up which is a mixture of your

875
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,230
administrative metric Plus available

876
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,030
bandwidth and you can provide all kind

877
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,490
of knobs and things right as the spec

878
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,619
gives you one example and suggest how to

879
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:32,339
do something like that but again it's

880
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:36,450
highly resilient so to debug the

881
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:39,000
security you have a lot of things which

882
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,390
are mostly same zero and those are the

883
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,210
reason

884
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,589
why you wouldn't not process the packets

885
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:47,339
father right

886
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:51,089
so there's may envelope maybe me saying

887
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:53,069
you don't accept the key ID the

888
00:45:51,089 --> 00:46:01,259
fingerprint is incorrect but there's

889
00:45:53,069 --> 00:46:03,000
lots of other stuff all kind of empty

890
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,069
fingerprints and so on so like a page

891
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,680
full of reasons why you would not

892
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:10,019
process it so here you see that it

893
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,848
accepted a non empty outer fingerprint

894
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:13,410
and accept that non empty origin

895
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:15,180
fingerprint and we had a lot of

896
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,470
discussions way out that's exaggerated

897
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,029
but anyway it good good amount of

898
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,529
discussion about all the performance

899
00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:23,819
right I mean would will be the

900
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:26,430
throughput because rift flats at depends

901
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:30,140
on what we implemented but something

902
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:32,190
like having you know 20 or 30 thousand

903
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,140
information element coming into the

904
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,789
database per second so we're not even

905
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,190
talking flooding rates that means that

906
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:40,170
is the consolidated flooding rate on all

907
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,900
the interface you're running is nothing

908
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,430
special right so the interface is makeup

909
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,390
cumulative at one hundred two hundred

910
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,519
thousand packets

911
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,618
I don't know widget almost interested

912
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,140
how fast is the dye to depth item data

913
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:54,319
base sucking up and of course at those

914
00:46:52,140 --> 00:47:00,029
rates we were very interested you know

915
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:03,329
we'll the encryption even hold up and no

916
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:05,309
problem at all on the generic CPU I mean

917
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:08,490
you can crank insane numbers once you

918
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:10,980
move into like 1024 204 a territory it

919
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,390
starts to get tricky so Bruno put out

920
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,799
actually I think an email on the list

921
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,348
where he measured the stuff what is

922
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:19,259
there practically speaking an envelope

923
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:20,849
you can run on generic CPU no and then

924
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:23,069
of course a view of multiple cores so

925
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:27,990
there's all kind of tricks but you can

926
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:30,180
run a very solid security without much

927
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:33,288
of a burden you know at very high rates

928
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:37,169
with lots of information

929
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:40,079
alright so interrupt testing security

930
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,819
was the focus we fully automate the

931
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,259
whole thing right the whole thing get

932
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,940
chucked on the usual continuous

933
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:46,980
integration things no manual like

934
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,660
pushing and kicking things no one has

935
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,769
time for that we are also to easy report

936
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,170
everything is passing at this point in

937
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:55,720
time

938
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,700
so that's that's a no custom image I

939
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,500
through pre-release package on Bruno

940
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,240
because we were iterating back and forth

941
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,790
he found one thing on my side they found

942
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,939
a thing on his side so so what did we

943
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,940
learn

944
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,240
so the fingerprints per said is the

945
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:15,160
envelope parsing and the one was not a

946
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,229
problem at all so like accepting the key

947
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,790
and parsing and I'll parsing the key and

948
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,450
and going after fingerprint that

949
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:27,819
basically just flipped it on lawns

950
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:31,450
reflection so here Bruno belief didn't

951
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:33,400
believe me when I relaxed the norms is

952
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,819
right and I was very specific that you

953
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:44,589
have to be fairly leisurely how you push

954
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:46,329
the knowns is up and how you how you

955
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:48,790
know what kind of nonsense you accept

956
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:53,049
how how much leeway do you give on the

957
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:54,520
nonce is so ah yeah so first of course

958
00:48:53,049 --> 00:48:56,710
it's very different from must be of eyes

959
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,950
eyes and by the way the rift security

960
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:02,859
has been learned directly from DoD so

961
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,779
it's based on work I did for DoD where

962
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:07,000
I've shown up with they wanted the most

963
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:11,260
secure IGP possible and when I've shown

964
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,609
up they gave me a solid hiding and then

965
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,359
I learned how you really built a

966
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:18,460
practical best-of-breed routing protocol

967
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:23,230
security for our GPS BGP is of course

968
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:27,160
different thing so the security we have

969
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:30,190
now covers both intra and Inter session

970
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,859
attacks and without need to store

971
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,020
anything in volatile storage because

972
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:37,119
those are the big precondition right so

973
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:38,559
there's nothing to attack it boots empty

974
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,140
knows that you can attack or store the

975
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,849
stake and then no matter what they're

976
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,190
trying to attack within the session or

977
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:46,569
after reboot a new session comes out you

978
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:52,780
try to attack we have protection

979
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:56,890
football Brewer thought that he'll go

980
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:58,990
Baron and the spec and he was advancing

981
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,819
his knowns is very very aggressively or

982
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,459
pretty much any packets anywhere

983
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:06,750
anything just push up my notes right and

984
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,750
that led to

985
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:13,470
and what the specs specify says that if

986
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:18,240
you see announced within five interval

987
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:24,509
compared to what you gave UK with it so

988
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:30,089
you have this slip of five now I give

989
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:32,400
you a interesting input Brune asked me

990
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:35,670
why you would even accept something that

991
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,340
is higher that you announced so I walked

992
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:40,140
him through implications of heavily

993
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:43,620
paralyzed implementation of routing

994
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:46,410
protocols where you may have multiple

995
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,240
clocks advancing India implementation at

996
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,430
different rates so it may happen that on

997
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,200
an interest that you will find yourself

998
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:56,520
receiving something which is ahead of

999
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:58,399
what you think where you are yes a

1000
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,360
brunet thing that he had published

1001
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,050
security report that he has other

1002
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:07,170
results in it yes so there's the

1003
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:08,610
security review I didn't see there I'm

1004
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:11,850
not sure what he's talking about with

1005
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:14,550
the publishing okay so Bruno was

1006
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:16,319
advancing the stuff so fast that when

1007
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,630
the FSM was like revving up and already

1008
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,480
doing some kind of flooding stuff he

1009
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:24,360
would be falling out five-window right

1010
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,340
so he was resetting the session so he

1011
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:31,860
had to back off and do pretty much what

1012
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:36,720
the spec suggests and then everything

1013
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:38,160
went went up nicely and even despite he

1014
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,859
was slightly concerned that he's a

1015
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,569
little bit more Asian leisurely the FSM

1016
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,040
is very resilient to attack so whatever

1017
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,080
you throw at it it will behave properly

1018
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,400
and you cannot attack it and reset the

1019
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,690
sessions you know and bring up the

1020
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,410
session if you don't have the proper

1021
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:55,200
credentials what draft was changed to

1022
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:57,029
because what emerged out of that trying

1023
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,089
to reset this FSM and so on I think it

1024
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:02,340
was Bruno's input we decided to send the

1025
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:04,740
remote nonce is zero in both one and two

1026
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,600
ways because I think I was more relaxed

1027
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:10,979
there that was the result so you cannot

1028
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:13,230
do because we couldn't negotiate the

1029
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,410
keys early enough always so the two-way

1030
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,930
will be already nonce protected details

1031
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,720
gave me it will be in his report ok so

1032
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:24,529
he said already there is

1033
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,209
a very detailed review report he updated

1034
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,130
on the second version so that talks

1035
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,650
about all possible attack vectors what

1036
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,540
we saw you know the finesse of the whole

1037
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,950
thing

1038
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:36,560
any questions I know there was

1039
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:39,109
comprehensive but his bony term were

1040
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:43,750
basically jump up and down we got an

1041
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:45,920
early review from the security one of

1042
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,650
director eight we addressed all the

1043
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,610
staff good while ago implemented

1044
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:56,780
interrupt what we got was we have been

1045
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:58,280
granted the exception by the ad to

1046
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,500
actually keep the security section

1047
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,660
within the spec rather than published in

1048
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,490
our security consideration draft which

1049
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:07,279
in my opinion which makes much more

1050
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:09,350
sense just like keeping the requirements

1051
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:14,750
and the security on the spec rather than

1052
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:16,640
slamming them around no questions so the

1053
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:19,520
only real discussion I saw what is

1054
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:29,540
router requirements that was floating

1055
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:31,490
around then that's it all right so no

1056
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,259
sorry there was there was a good

1057
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:35,439
discussion with the ZTE but it was

1058
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:38,030
fairly early that was about the v4 v6

1059
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:46,760
negotiation as well so it's very close

1060
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:50,560
to that okay so we had update on a

1061
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:54,170
protocol and on the implication

1062
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:58,690
implementation and next on the agenda is

1063
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:58,690
the rhibs applicability statement threat

1064
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:04,210
[Music]

1065
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:06,890
good afternoon I'm Sonny da from that he

1066
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:09,280
this furnishing is for rift

1067
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:14,980
applicability

1068
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,980
we have many co-author for this chart

1069
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:28,799
and let's see the background of rift

1070
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:32,009
protocol we know that the cross and fat

1071
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:36,299
tree topology have gained predominance

1072
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:41,940
in today's networking and from the many

1073
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:46,079
many deployment X terraces we get record

1074
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:48,960
some key points for it

1075
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,960
the first one is extensive configuration

1076
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:57,210
because we know that there's many

1077
00:54:51,960 --> 00:55:00,390
devices in the DC fabrics so the

1078
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:05,430
configuration burden is very great for

1079
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:08,790
the network administrator so it's a key

1080
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:14,040
problem here to be sold and then the

1081
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:16,829
second points is that the leaf node has

1082
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:21,180
the same data base with other node in

1083
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:27,000
the network because of the IDP filter

1084
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:31,169
and we know that we always use OSPF or

1085
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,500
he sees in these fabrics but every node

1086
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:38,339
in the network will maintain the same

1087
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:41,730
database so the leaf node will have the

1088
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:44,970
same database with other nodes it's a it

1089
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:47,849
brings great burden to the leaf nodes of

1090
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:52,169
course we know that maybe the reef nodes

1091
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:56,609
is only our horse so he can't burden so

1092
00:55:52,170 --> 00:56:00,410
many routes and the database and the

1093
00:55:56,609 --> 00:56:03,359
three key point is the flooding

1094
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:06,029
duplication because we know that it's

1095
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:13,369
very special connection in that is a

1096
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:17,630
fabrics and so as Tony just said in this

1097
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:21,780
network if we use traditional

1098
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:25,319
IDP flooding function the duplication

1099
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:31,130
cannot be avoided so the panelist will

1100
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:33,349
be wasted and the normal flooding of the

1101
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:35,739
database will be in

1102
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,739


1103
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:45,549
that season this picture you know that

1104
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:49,430
lift can be used in these fabrics on

1105
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:52,699
Metro fabulous and building covering or

1106
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:55,989
internal router switching fabrics or

1107
00:56:52,699 --> 00:57:01,549
crud Co all these networks have this

1108
00:56:55,989 --> 00:57:06,190
thing or the like topological like for

1109
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:11,209
the tree so how it can be used in these

1110
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:15,140
networks we know that rift is a new

1111
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:19,219
dynamic routing protocol for the cross

1112
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:23,660
and factory approaches because the key

1113
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:26,749
feature of rift is that you see it uses

1114
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:30,558
a different advertisement for different

1115
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:34,009
directions it's more like a link Stata

1116
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:37,160
protocol whereupon knows and it's more

1117
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:43,900
like a path vector protocol well point

1118
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:46,549
source and the rift protocol is fully

1119
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:50,059
automated construction based on

1120
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:54,529
detection of link so it can support CTP

1121
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:58,039
the demons zero touch permission so it

1122
00:57:54,529 --> 00:58:02,209
can greet reduce the burden of the

1123
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:05,719
network administrator you can just plug

1124
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:09,549
the device in the network and it will

1125
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:12,739
work and the rift protocol also

1126
00:58:09,549 --> 00:58:16,729
minimizes the amount of routing state

1127
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:21,140
held at each level such as in the leaf

1128
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:25,509
node at just the leaf node has only the

1129
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:31,249
default Road in the normal situation if

1130
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:34,190
some links has broken the key future of

1131
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:37,368
the riveter is positive or

1132
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:41,589
disaggregation will so this problem so

1133
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:46,069
there are only a photo route or some

1134
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:47,370
small small amount of a specific route

1135
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:51,740
will be held

1136
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:54,270
in the leaf node and also lift can

1137
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,939
automatically prunes and load the

1138
00:58:54,270 --> 00:59:01,140
balances the topology flooding exchanges

1139
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:05,670
over sufficient subset of links stone

1140
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:08,629
Justice ed and the sake point yes I just

1141
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:14,390
mention it is the automatic

1142
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:14,390
disaggregating of who prefixes so

1143
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:20,400
according to these key features the sub

1144
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:26,970
optimal ranking and the black holding

1145
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:30,150
can be avoided and also Rifkin supports

1146
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:32,640
a rift allows trafficker steering and

1147
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:36,510
rerouting policies because good

1148
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:42,319
extension and also it allows loop of

1149
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:46,440
three non SNP verdict and it can support

1150
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:50,280
it can automatically support the balance

1151
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:53,450
of trafficker towards the spine based on

1152
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,640
the panelists were available and also it

1153
00:59:53,450 --> 01:00:00,870
can provide the mechanisms to

1154
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:03,600
synchronize immediately in value and he

1155
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:07,770
readily restore that can be used avatar

1156
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:10,560
protocol convergence so from it we know

1157
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:14,390
that there's many listed the yes many

1158
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:19,950
advantages in critical routing protocol

1159
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:24,000
and also from it we know that lived can

1160
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:28,919
also support horizontal links and the

1161
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:33,930
vertical cuts so it's naturally that

1162
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:40,010
roof can be used in the networks that is

1163
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:42,020
list here listed here that's all the

1164
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:47,660
applicable bility

1165
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:47,660
statements any question

1166
01:00:57,829 --> 01:01:04,170
okay thank you

1167
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:06,808
so right now the the documents at the

1168
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:10,109
version 0-1 right it's it's it's it's

1169
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:14,029
still individual draft well yes we

1170
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:14,029
develop it for walking or adoption

1171
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:26,390
networks just one comment in the

1172
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,299
previous slide do you want to also add

1173
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:35,339
some statement about scalability and

1174
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:40,788
number of adjacencies which could be a

1175
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:47,849
plus that's our inability

1176
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:50,099
implementations on EP Jennifer so yeah a

1177
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:51,930
number Jesus you can support is large in

1178
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:54,269
humanization specific about the

1179
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:56,940
scalability of the protocol based on the

1180
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:59,269
fact that it summarizes up right and you

1181
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:13,220
have much less information also the

1182
01:01:59,269 --> 01:02:13,220
blast radius that is the protocol yes

1183
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,869
now that you mention it working your

1184
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:22,288
production I wanted to mention that what

1185
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:25,019
sure says is that we wanna release

1186
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:29,849
stating it it talks about how employee

1187
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:32,279
and configure drift policies well I

1188
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:36,720
think this Nachman does is it basically

1189
01:02:32,279 --> 01:02:38,460
summarizes the features and then it says

1190
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:43,098
oh because it has those features

1191
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:49,650
recognition powers as my father because

1192
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:54,980
though in this meeting I pay little

1193
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:59,450
attention means use cases in use cases

1194
01:02:54,980 --> 01:03:02,360
expressing but in the draft yes many

1195
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:09,109
texts on the use cases for

1196
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:11,650
yeah I didn't read it all but it looks

1197
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:15,320
like there's maybe one or two paragraphs

1198
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:17,780
for each of the ears cases no I don't

1199
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,600
know that that's a lot I don't think

1200
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:22,280
that's a lot and I don't think that in

1201
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:26,240
one of the two paragraphs you can talk

1202
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:29,570
about how to employ and configure for

1203
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,250
each one of these cases so again with

1204
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:33,880
the grain of salt I haven't read the

1205
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:37,370
whole thing but but it seems to me that

1206
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:43,190
this draft in the correct form is not

1207
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:46,819
what we want to meet the Charter this

1208
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:48,230
sounds more and don't take this the

1209
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:51,170
wrong way but this sounds more like a

1210
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:54,700
marketing sorry this is all the great

1211
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:57,920
things well correct which is great but

1212
01:03:54,700 --> 01:04:00,980
it doesn't tell me if I need to apply

1213
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,230
rift to a fabric for this excited for

1214
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:10,130
example what considerations should I

1215
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:13,520
take like a figure of the point why so

1216
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:21,230
we can add more detail in the use cases

1217
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:24,740
right okay okay so I think your message

1218
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:26,990
to call us to work more on it to clarify

1219
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:35,750
use cases to increase number of use

1220
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:40,100
cases and so you have fine use cases I

1221
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:44,920
mean what do you need magic number we

1222
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:49,160
have to cross add more detail about

1223
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:52,670
right no it's more like question 2 up to

1224
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:55,220
280 so first is no Zoe what's wrong with

1225
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:57,860
5 and the second one we are under the

1226
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:01,700
curse over our own design because if you

1227
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:03,590
run rifting ztp is literally the

1228
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,450
configuration cover with one sentence

1229
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:10,760
which took off the fabric on the top of

1230
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:11,930
the fabric and you're done algorithm

1231
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,599
elevate

1232
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:16,129
so there's nothing wrong with life

1233
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,440
there's nothing wrong with seven there's

1234
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:21,589
probably nothing wrong with white so

1235
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,180
what we want or what I thought we had

1236
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:26,029
weed from the beginning of the Charter

1237
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:28,700
with Satan is to say okay now here we

1238
01:05:26,029 --> 01:05:29,859
have the Peugeot specification this is

1239
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,930
how you use it

1240
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:34,460
now you just have something interesting

1241
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:37,669
which is well this is so easy to just

1242
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:41,750
cook your regular them so maybe there

1243
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:43,190
aren't that many considerations we

1244
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,109
specifically mentioned this in the

1245
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:48,609
Charter because you know I want to make

1246
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:51,348
sure that when people are going to use

1247
01:05:48,609 --> 01:05:53,480
people are going to use script that they

1248
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:55,609
know how to the point that if there are

1249
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,579
deployment considerations that people

1250
01:05:55,609 --> 01:05:59,630
consider them and so that you know I

1251
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:01,789
don't know if I need to think about

1252
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:05,480
about the science of breath dilemmas

1253
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:08,900
that is to say that that below just like

1254
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:11,089
security you could have a session in

1255
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:14,779
here in the big document which is

1256
01:06:11,089 --> 01:06:16,210
already a hundred 40 pages to say these

1257
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:19,279
are those employment considerations

1258
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:22,279
there's an RFC that I forget which one

1259
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:26,329
it is in the 5000 series I'm going to

1260
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:32,410
say 51:43 but where was the fetish

1261
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:32,410
checker you check their talks about

1262
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,859
deployment that manage malicious

1263
01:06:34,609 --> 01:06:38,420
iterations and so it talks about if I

1264
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:42,020
really a new protocol what kinds of

1265
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:44,390
things going to think if I mean yeah

1266
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:48,529
something that that's the type of thing

1267
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:50,029
they want to see it may be that you know

1268
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:53,720
the program is so simple and so easy to

1269
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:57,410
use that you really have considerations

1270
01:06:53,720 --> 01:07:04,009
and that's fine as long as you explain

1271
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:06,700
why and it's not just so great to do

1272
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:06,700
something in there

1273
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,600
Tony so yes I remember us narsing like

1274
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:22,370
that so thanks for this reference yes

1275
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:24,680
required reading where we had deployment

1276
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,330
consideration was basically miss Kay

1277
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:30,620
plate right that's where the stuff pops

1278
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:31,730
up on the security this stuff I saw it

1279
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,850
Bruna was more implementation

1280
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:38,000
considerations with where he had to

1281
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:39,470
loosen up he stopped otherwise keys are

1282
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,360
keys where we can put something in like

1283
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:44,209
urea stores Pyo science key management

1284
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:47,570
same thing I mean if that contributes

1285
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:50,060
anything and we had the configuration

1286
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:52,880
which is just embarrassing Li you know

1287
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,740
little stuff to say really about and I

1288
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,340
throw one thing where I stopped diploma

1289
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:00,020
considerations really is you really want

1290
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,340
your loop back alright so I had

1291
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,930
something about the loop back to the

1292
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:06,400
world ago to the loop X if you lose part

1293
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:08,750
of the Fed right so don't tell me and

1294
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:15,580
just for the record were sick minutes

1295
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:18,290
it's our secret so no six Thank You

1296
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:21,380
Midianites Yandex as one of the core

1297
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:24,259
services with draft yeah some parts

1298
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:28,220
could be more detailed shut up on me

1299
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:30,520
because analyzes was down lately so it's

1300
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:33,680
not in this draft but but of particular

1301
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:36,109
in DC fabrics if you want to do though

1302
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,880
hamid costs and keep them out of route

1303
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:43,790
and say it's small okay there is an RFC

1304
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,020
how to do out in in DC using bgp but it

1305
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:47,330
comes through there really really

1306
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,700
difficult to most minimize state and the

1307
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:52,040
door holland for example because it

1308
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:54,108
essentially requires the condition of

1309
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,390
desegregation base it on normal or

1310
01:08:54,109 --> 01:09:00,160
confirmation very difficult to do this

1311
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:00,160
out a lot of additional logic

1312
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:13,250
okay so well looks like we need to have

1313
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:16,129
at least one more revision before we can

1314
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:24,170
go to get ready for the I would grew up

1315
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:34,490
at auction okay thank you thanks ad so

1316
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:34,940
those are the okay all right so here's a

1317
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:40,700
question

1318
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:43,370
ad bound so do we have to last call

1319
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:45,380
everything as a package what's the deal

1320
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:48,920
also with LSD our because at this point

1321
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:50,510
in time the protocol spec is very

1322
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,120
thoroughly cooked with two

1323
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:56,060
implementations and I have people ask me

1324
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:00,769
where the world I have authority for the

1325
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:03,410
RFPs and their life so Eastern policy

1326
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:05,300
here or what can we go to the last call

1327
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:07,130
of the protocol spec one all the stuff

1328
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,750
of course is absolutely necessary and

1329
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,750
committed to end the one interlock

1330
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:17,900
algorithm lovingly

1331
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:22,790
so you said what's up with a yard that's

1332
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:25,250
a different to will have less call

1333
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:33,769
everything I think when we did the

1334
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:37,610
milestones we said that we would process

1335
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:40,640
together the protocol is Jiri which is

1336
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:42,049
now one document so now that means that

1337
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,720
you don't necessary have to last column

1338
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:50,510
in together so we can progress protocol

1339
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:52,430
now again if for example in the case

1340
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:55,430
with a sustainability statement which we

1341
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:57,620
put later the mouth cells if this is

1342
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:59,890
going to be folded into the special

1343
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:01,970
perspective because it's so simple then

1344
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:06,010
yeah

1345
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:06,010
but otherwise we should

1346
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:32,420
on the time frame for gamers better

1347
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:35,700
friendly suggestion mostly at the chairs

1348
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:37,080
Jeffrey I think what I heard while I

1349
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:40,530
wasn't reading my email which of course

1350
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:43,670
wasn't doing the turn the discussion of

1351
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:46,110
the applicability draft was like

1352
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:48,870
presumably applicability a draft and

1353
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:50,250
then there were you know some criticisms

1354
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:51,900
of it whatever and then you say well

1355
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:56,100
maybe it's not ready for adoption yet

1356
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:59,700
and God so it sounds to me like the

1357
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,230
working group is discussing a draft that

1358
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,590
the working group is chartered to

1359
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:06,150
produce which sounds to me exactly like

1360
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:08,940
what a working group is supposed to

1361
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:11,190
adopt a graph to do like normally you

1362
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:13,169
don't you know wait until a draft is

1363
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:15,089
perfect before adopting it you adopt it

1364
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:16,860
when you're like yeah this is kind of

1365
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:19,590
what we're supposed to be working on and

1366
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:21,240
then you insist it to be perfect at last

1367
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:24,030
call time but it's your group I mean run

1368
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,670
it the way you want to so I think the

1369
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:28,730
intention was just to address I

1370
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:33,230
recommend in another revision and then

1371
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:33,230
not to delay it for another six months

1372
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:39,530
thank you for good

1373
01:12:49,140 --> 01:13:00,220
okay so we've heard this updates on the

1374
01:12:55,870 --> 01:13:04,900
base protocol the implementation and

1375
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:08,070
this pretty reinstatement now we again

1376
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:18,099
let's look at the Orion group status

1377
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:22,780
have some discussion on yet okay so as

1378
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:25,989
when you're understand now the zero six

1379
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:29,530
revision has been posted we did the

1380
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:32,200
wrote interrupter directory renew by

1381
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:35,200
Ross Thank You Russ and the authors in

1382
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,840
Ross had extensive discussions in the

1383
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:40,230
last two days and the or they agreed on

1384
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:43,600
that the changes they need to happen and

1385
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:47,169
the zero seven radiation will be out

1386
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,420
soon the pen is to issue the working

1387
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:53,080
group last call right up sir does your

1388
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:55,570
server 0-7 revision and and this does

1389
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,989
not have to wait until we go we peppered

1390
01:13:55,570 --> 01:14:04,059
the previous statements on to be ready

1391
01:13:58,989 --> 01:14:06,089
and so originally we thought we would

1392
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:11,800
call for that option for the

1393
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:16,780
applicability statements I think well

1394
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:20,260
wait for the next revision and the yes

1395
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:22,599
back he was adopted the last time there

1396
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:27,970
still must a minor updated they need to

1397
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:33,790
be done issued last last call after

1398
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:37,870
after that multicast wraps we taught but

1399
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:41,260
we discussed the multicast ideas and at

1400
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:45,670
last IETF meeting and we put out the

1401
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:47,620
zero zero radiation initial craft we

1402
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:51,310
still need to put in more details

1403
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:54,280
especially around on the ties format and

1404
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:56,300
things like that and when we were not

1405
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:59,420
ready to discuss it further

1406
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:02,120
at this time but we will have another

1407
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:07,940
revision out and then were discussing

1408
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:10,700
more the next IDF meeting after update

1409
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:12,589
of young draft we will request young

1410
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:17,599
doctors review school before working

1411
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:21,230
with the school then there are some

1412
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:24,800
other site work the future work needs to

1413
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:29,059
be done we have put out initial drafts

1414
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:35,570
before have not reaction work on those

1415
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:37,790
yet so we'll continue on that after the

1416
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:40,280
main items are taking care of our own

1417
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:46,660
people have more bandwidth that includes

1418
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:46,660
the pgps signal routing and mark asta

1419
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:56,410
any thoughts comments any new ideas I

1420
01:15:52,070 --> 01:16:00,670
know that Pascal some has some ideas on

1421
01:15:56,410 --> 01:16:07,010
other work iTunes can be done we can

1422
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:18,110
talk about that either anytime so what

1423
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:20,150
follow up on that if some people dig

1424
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:23,960
down the year or discussions we had we

1425
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:26,059
are topics like very mobile and devices

1426
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,740
we don't want to 12 state in the

1427
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,660
intermediate layers you just want to put

1428
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:31,490
the state to satisfy them turn off from

1429
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:33,950
the spine to the leaf Adam very mobile

1430
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:36,500
carriers so we are things like that

1431
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:40,160
optimize very special cases we coverage

1432
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:42,620
it's useful so yes the I just floating

1433
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:45,980
in here and we are ready to realize that

1434
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:48,380
ready time zombies it have immediate

1435
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:53,419
right so it's just unclear that we have

1436
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:54,530
a need for any mobile or any scalable

1437
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:58,310
networks

1438
01:16:54,530 --> 01:17:05,179
we're maintaining state again 2011 would

1439
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:09,790
be inefficient in order to do it we just

1440
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:09,790
did not see a need for it

1441
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:20,830
Tony yeah so all these things are kind

1442
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:23,780
of back burner because from my side I

1443
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:25,940
see people being entertained by it when

1444
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:31,550
I asked them whether they would deploy

1445
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:36,739
that or are willing to talk deployment

1446
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:39,530
scenarios I just don't see use cases I

1447
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:41,419
mean my kids like SR right today's

1448
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,440
loopback sits talked extensively little

1449
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,150
bit and I put in deployment

1450
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:47,210
considerations one or two things they're

1451
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:51,589
like watch for this in very anomalous

1452
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:53,060
scenarios but for example SR was leased

1453
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,640
to leave and at the end you basically

1454
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:58,820
tunnel anyway so why would you even need

1455
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:00,830
that in your life but it's it's simply

1456
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,330
that why these things is it's tender

1457
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:04,250
loving care because there's simply not

1458
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:05,870
enough people pushing for having a

1459
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:08,600
deployment each shortest average for

1460
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:10,550
example them the multi-homing of servers

1461
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,610
is as a lot of interest earned by the

1462
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:15,020
hunter coming and the people like

1463
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:17,000
realizing that you can master all the

1464
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:19,400
servers lots of problems you're solving

1465
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
today in weird way is to simply

1466
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:25,849
disappear right yeah understand the way

1467
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,770
there are there are things that so we

1468
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:34,160
talked about before and started to work

1469
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:36,290
some work before we we have not really

1470
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:39,530
focused on them and we may decide them

1471
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:43,010
and they're not worth working on so just

1472
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:52,239
some things that on the list we can

1473
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:54,530
decide what to do with them later so

1474
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:57,469
ideally we should keep this documents

1475
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:59,660
alive if later on the need arises
