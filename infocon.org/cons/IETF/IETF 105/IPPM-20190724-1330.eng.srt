1
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:29,119
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,130
this is AI ppm might be performance

3
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,019
metrics

4
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,980
oh no it's not IP performance metrics

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,570
anymore we actually had a conversation

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,069
about that about a year ago now in type

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,170
II performance measurement it's actually

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,260
correct on the slides

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:46,269
I'm Brian criminal co-chair polychaete

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,480
are you gonna comment on the name Matt

11
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,480
thank you sir

12
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,340
if you intend to be an IP PM you're in

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,599
the right place if you don't intend to

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,660
be an IP p.m. you're gonna learn some

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,600
stuff today so I'm Brian criminal I'm

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:07,880
Paulie Oh Jeff Pilson training could not

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:12,320
be here with us um no well this is an

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:16,548
IETF working for meaning you say here

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,500
can and will be used as a IETF

20
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,070
contribution if you don't know what that

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,720
means

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:25,520
have a look at documents here next we

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,170
have an agenda it's extremely full I

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,610
don't think we're going to get to all of

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,710
the things on our lightning talk to you

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,270
they're gonna look at the status on some

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,309
of the documents that are heading out

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,600
we're gonna talk a little bit about um

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,090
next steps for IOM then some updates on

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,880
these are the ITU liaisons I guess alwal

31
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,950
I will keep us up to date on how he's

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,270
been talking to himself I think because

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:57,409
you're you're both sides of that liaison

34
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:58,600
a very trip right oh no okay oh okay

35
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:03,530
cool

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,500
excellent um talk about advanced route

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,410
metrics the multi altmark then we'll go

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,860
into the iom content section of today's

39
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,299
agenda we have a few individual drops

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,379
that have had list discussions so we're

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,200
gonna go ahead and give them some you

42
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,620
Jenda as well so stamp option TLV is

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,958
actually

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,540
quite a lot of discussion and is

45
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,830
basically ready it was already he call

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,569
for adoption is though yeah I know right

47
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,980
we have to figure out that yeah exactly

48
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,988
great um screen team of s rpm and then

49
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,690
the postcard kilometer II stuff which I

50
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,650
understand there was also some hackathon

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,870
activity on the postcard telemetry as

52
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:47,269
well then we have our our lightning talk

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,060
queue as I said there are more here than

54
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,470
will fit but if we go fast then all of

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,120
them and if we don't go fast they will

56
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,840
not or apologies to those at the end of

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,500
this queue um so let's talk about status

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,230
updates we published 8545 we sent the

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,500
registry drops to the iesg it actually

60
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,349
turns out that um I am the I there was a

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,400
miscommunication on that one the on the

62
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,810
Shepherd for one of them and the

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,489
Shepherd statement is incomplete he

64
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,769
sends the iesg anyway but I will fix

65
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,980
that this week but those should go

66
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,390
through relatively quickly and it was

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,950
cool I was actually I copied these

68
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,170
slides from the last time that we had a

69
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,450
meeting and it said that - I'm peeing

70
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,220
was in miss Ref and it's still in this

71
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:35,209
rough um so yeah we're done with it but

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,950
no nothing to support there was clear

73
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,730
support for adoption on the list for

74
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,920
stamp from TLV there was a discussion

75
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,099
about some changes there requested will

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,458
these be addressed in the IETF I ppm

77
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,849
zero zero on Gregor you here or is

78
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,150
someone else who is a author of that

79
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,518
document here okay so we will note yeah

80
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,489
we will we will note that we as chairs

81
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,299
would prefer to see the resolution of

82
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:07,310
that discussion in is your zero Rev of

83
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,829
that so let that be minute do we have if

84
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,810
we get no takers for this we do okay

85
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:19,190
excellent hi and javis cards and

86
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:20,570
everything perfect so I am I think we've

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,820
done some really really good work on

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,740
this so so Frank when did this come in

89
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,740
this was a little over a year ago right

90
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:39,539
that's over a year ago oh you want me to

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,359
skip the slide okay perfect

92
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,770
um I think personally and also as chair

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,560
this was a good idea I think we got a

94
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,109
really good on this is what sort of

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,340
Crosse area contribution in the IETF and

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,569
cross your review in the IETF is

97
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,080
supposed to look like I mean this came

98
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,430
from a different community came in here

99
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,919
we got you know good feedback good

100
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:04,800
discussion um there are a few other sort

101
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,229
of like options to add on here that data

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,900
the data model graft is basically done

103
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:16,430
um then as we discussed a lot at our

104
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,190
meeting in Prague the next set of

105
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,710
documents a lot of them focused on

106
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,699
encapsulation headers um the question

107
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,758
that I want to ask from the chair is so

108
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,229
bringing eilean and I ppm got um a lot

109
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,969
of sort of measurement focused and

110
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,758
transport focused eyes on it I think

111
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:38,099
this was a very good thing is this room

112
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,800
the right place to get the right eyes on

113
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:47,039
the in caps drafts so with respect to

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:52,190
the ipv6 destination option I think the

115
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:54,300
answer is yes um we have had a good

116
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,889
cooperation with the six men working

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,889
group which is so we do the work here

118
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,800
and and there's review in six-man in the

119
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,169
past for measurement related destination

120
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,120
options headers so let's do that again

121
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:11,180
for the other ones I think we really do

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,219
opinion and I want to I want to open the

123
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,759
discussion up a little bit to see if

124
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:19,050
there are other opinions on this that

125
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,849
for each of these documents we need to

126
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,800
make sure that the right people are in

127
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:27,360
the room to understand the nuances of of

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,210
whether you know this encapsulation is

129
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,449
the way that it should be and there are

130
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,190
people in line Danaher so I'm a little

131
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:39,899
concerned with the broadness of these

132
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,289
encapsulations okay I know so we know

133
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,169
about the ipv6 yep

134
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,969
that makes sense I am a little worried

135
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,159
that this is going to try to cover every

136
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:52,248
possible cancellation including some UDP

137
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,389
encapsulations where questionable

138
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:55,129
whether or not you can even do that

139
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:59,059
participant yeah

140
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,710
I assume that's our visa so what is the

141
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:04,300
scope of these encapsulation every kind

142
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,680
of so there's the set of documents

143
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,599
there's the set of documents that have

144
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,889
been written so that's the when I say

145
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,680
these in calculations I mean the

146
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,080
documents that exist and so there was a

147
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,469
discussion for example on an ipv4 option

148
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,089
which is II I don't think that's going

149
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,439
to happen let's put it that way that's

150
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,259
the non-pejorative way to say that is I

151
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,839
don't think that's going to happen um

152
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:29,199
there was discussion about an ether type

153
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,399
or about using a next header field

154
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:40,339
there's all of these so they're the

155
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:42,319
encapsulation of documents it's great so

156
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:44,509
I think it's clear for ipv6 maybe it's

157
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,199
right before that would be a separate

158
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,959
discussion but how do you determine

159
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,229
where the work is if everywhere yeah all

160
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,819
right so so so what I'm hearing is at

161
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,080
least feedback in this room that we

162
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:01,249
think there might be too many of them

163
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,849
and we need to focus on a few it is that

164
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:07,789
kind of is that a good paraphrase and we

165
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:10,009
might need to focus on a few face

166
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:19,550
subsets of them I like the ones that we

167
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:20,839
are it's completely separate from so the

168
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,240
assumption is you should be able to take

169
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,240
that apply it in two different places

170
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,680
some a little bit more perspective on

171
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,809
the whole thing so we did it a couple

172
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,519
model or the data fields from the

173
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,458
encapsulation for that very purpose to

174
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,829
allow for different speeds on all the

175
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:51,138
things getting put into one over the

176
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:53,420
other carrier protocol the whole thing

177
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:54,870
is contribution drilling right you know

178
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,910
we calmly say you

179
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,010
would on this and then nobody waits on

180
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,920
this and it's all a key priority I think

181
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,350
that's more useful to decide so I think

182
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,529
we have we're going on and multiple

183
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,360
working groups were there is a national

184
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:11,550
home for that particular in caption

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,070
encapsulation to happen I think the best

186
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,920
example was Ennis age was relatively

187
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,800
straightforward and as age got picked up

188
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:28,680
in SFC yeah what's the status of that

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:31,410
graph right now so I think that's a good

190
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,079
example there is work on SR that happens

191
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,279
in spring there is work on MPLS that

192
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,730
happens in MPLS there is work on genève

193
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:46,680
that kind of happens in em do three at

194
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:49,500
the pace 2003 and but I still believe

195
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,420
that it's useful even though there is

196
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,270
kind of peering working routes that we

197
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,000
need one place because otherwise you end

198
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,350
up with 3x planing the case to these

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,260
other working groups especially if

200
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,510
they're fresh and new - to - I um is

201
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,950
technology despite the fact I think that

202
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,220
we've done the shopping tour so many

203
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,990
times so if we can keep a handle and

204
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:16,680
have kind of a home for the thing step

205
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,209
well I um related and I ppm and then go

206
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,880
for Peoria be used with the various

207
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,810
working groups in case they are not we

208
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,320
focused and willing to go and pick some

209
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,689
things up then I'd much welcome that and

210
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,020
this also a way where you can go and

211
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,730
then inspire your level of priority by

212
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,850
people come into a common place it's set

213
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,500
off you need to go on Sheppard well we

214
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,570
just pretty act pretty much how to have

215
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,660
what have this chicken like Germans call

216
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,950
it or herding cats like in English I

217
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:49,230
like the headless chicken face

218
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:52,020
just imagine the picture I think then

219
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,850
it's much harder to go hurt the cats if

220
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,400
you don't even have a common place where

221
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,990
all the cats come at it can I ask a

222
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:05,310
question how many run cats do we have to

223
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:10,550
hurt I mean so the so v6 is here yeah

224
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,550
because I have a very cool we'll talk

225
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,868
yeah I don't I do think that we only

226
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:20,050
have a a to answer a question around two

227
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:27,429
things so maybe it's less of a hard

228
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:29,378
question that we think yeah maybe leave

229
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,970
an area director I just want to add one

230
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,230
point because like every working group

231
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,759
has a charter and some of the working

232
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,439
groups I tread it to do their own

233
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,029
extension and they own a no other work

234
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,230
we have such extensions so we have to

235
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,509
like look what's in their chart as well

236
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,889
not only wasn't the Charter and

237
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,839
individual note on what something you

238
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,550
said I think this is going around and

239
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,529
explaining it every time to all the

240
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,699
people over and over again that's you

241
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,230
actually that's actually a positive

242
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,089
thing because you explain it to those

243
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,529
people who want to use it right if

244
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,179
you're working on this protocol and they

245
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,670
need to understand it you have to do it

246
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:02,230
anyway

247
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,540
good point I think the comment was more

248
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,170
towards stuff that doesn't have a

249
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,939
natural or so certain things don't have

250
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,368
a natural like this either type thing

251
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:14,980
yeah it's hard to go and find the right

252
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:17,589
place for it if you have a have the

253
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,779
right place for something then well I

254
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,059
think we both with the exception of

255
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,509
six-man maybe we have all the people

256
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:27,670
pick it up that thought like yeah here

257
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:30,160
is the whole I think the problem doesn't

258
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,870
we exist where we have a real working

259
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,370
group let us focus on the extensions I

260
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,420
think it's more the problem where we

261
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:39,490
don't have so I would I would submit

262
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,709
that would be either tight specifically

263
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,149
the right people to make the

264
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,910
determination about how to do that or

265
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,829
definitely not in this room um however

266
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,249
let me make a suggestion and see if this

267
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:51,069
works

268
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:52,360
for future you know for president

269
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:54,069
encapsulations where we don't know where

270
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,749
there's a home and future encapsulations

271
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:58,089
that people might be interested in I

272
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:59,709
think I ppm is a place to discuss those

273
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:04,149
and dispatch them out to the place they

274
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:05,829
need to go okay so let's do that and so

275
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,199
of course we'll want to hear you know

276
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:09,878
more in your talk Frank but I think the

277
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,709
one of the proposals I was going to make

278
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,889
that we can think on while we're

279
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:19,989
listening to all of this is you know

280
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:21,249
definitely have a slot E&I ppm in which

281
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,360
we kind of get the update of the status

282
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,160
of all depth

283
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,040
Nations but I think we've definitely

284
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:31,149
seen load-in lightning talks or in other

285
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,219
talks of individual presentations for

286
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,800
given encapsulations for which I think

287
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,810
the content we don't have the experts in

288
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,069
the room to really know whether or not

289
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,349
this is the right direction so I think

290
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,790
having updates of summaries of how these

291
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,269
are all progressing how we can dispatch

292
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,880
how we can help is very productive but

293
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:50,560
we we may want to consider like when we

294
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,779
get requests for a lightning talk of

295
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,699
here's a new encapsulation say this

296
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,500
should instead be folded into the update

297
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:01,779
of how we're expanding our

298
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:03,070
encapsulations throughout that yes all

299
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,930
right I think when you're done with that

300
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,930
one so we will go on to liaison updates

301
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:25,720
Alvie is on roundups sorry hello

302
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,230
everybody hello everybody hello

303
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,910
everybody so I'm trying to make this as

304
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,610
exciting as possible that's that's for

305
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:37,870
sure so let's just jump ahead that's a

306
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:40,180
picture from the Calgary Stampede so

307
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,930
here's the progress to harmonize on a

308
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,949
metric of IP layer capacity really on

309
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:53,019
the maximum IPR capacity at ITT study

310
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:55,930
group 12 we have sort of moved their

311
00:14:53,019 --> 00:15:00,220
end-to-end performance and specification

312
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:04,029
recommendation by 1540 down the approval

313
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,070
line with about 39 I guess it's about 39

314
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,870
new pages something like that the lab

315
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,880
and field testing is complete field

316
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,160
tests with many different access types

317
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,060
confirm the lab results that we've been

318
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,010
doing for about a year now so we've

319
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,899
still got some speed bumps comments to

320
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,480
resolve but we're on the way to do that

321
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,860
so in the etsy Technical Committee on

322
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,610
speech and multimedia transmission

323
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,920
quality stq they've are telling us that

324
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,600
they've approved their revised technical

325
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,150
specification on high-speed Internet

326
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,360
kpi's and that's so that ones have done

327
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,500
for maximum IP you air capacity that's

328
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,320
going to help us get those other

329
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,770
comments resolved in fact so that's a

330
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,540
good thing I'm not really working in BBF

331
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,569
but I've had some informal discussions

332
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,550
as I mentioned here at the bottom but

333
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,390
they sent us a liaison here in IP p.m.

334
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,829
on their quality of experience delivered

335
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,390
basically three items that are of

336
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,770
interest to folks here who measure

337
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:07,020
performance QED the application

338
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,060
performance that they are performance

339
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,860
that's done and of course they've got IP

340
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,170
where performance testing it's based on

341
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,120
stamp and Greg mirskiy is working with

342
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,520
them diligently there

343
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,730
so the informal discussions I've had

344
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,500
kindly set up by Dave cynic rope I've

345
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,900
encouraged taking up the work on IP

346
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,700
layer capacity and I'm gonna fly around

347
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,890
Europe in September trying to get that

348
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:33,950
started so we'll see how that goes and

349
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:36,300
so let's see we have the opportunity to

350
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,280
discuss and possibly join the hardened

351
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,859
organization this week it seems like

352
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,010
we've got about three three and a half

353
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,130
maybe let's say three and a half legs of

354
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:50,310
a four legged table in harmonizing on IP

355
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,500
layer capacity and a planned side

356
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:56,310
meeting this week to discuss both the

357
00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:02,640
draft and the liaison rep I so that's it

358
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:04,230
I wrap I've rounded it all up oh you

359
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,000
can't read routing more than a ppm

360
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,160
capcity capcity

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,750
yeah why is it why they say that it's

362
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,110
it's because it started out to be a

363
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:16,250
draft where we helped a trivia people

364
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:19,589
learn about capital cities okay

365
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,420
the real story is Mike Mike Mikey board

366
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,470
and missus characters and Al didn't see

367
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:28,820
it is that a typo in the link or is not

368
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:31,500
yeah right now it's a typo in the draft

369
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,990
and now I don't have to cover this

370
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,820
during my draft time I'm gonna put up

371
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,410
another zero zero or a capacity is

372
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,570
spelled correctly and then I'll go to

373
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,310
work on the cap city one where which

374
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,659
helps to tribute people okay excellent

375
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:48,929
thank you thank you two questions for

376
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,620
alumnus going once going twice

377
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:54,210
next up

378
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:58,379
we have al Martin oh okay

379
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,030
ah Nora thank you so no update to the

380
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:06,210
draft but lots of good comments thank

381
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:08,370
you Frank partners let's go let's say we

382
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,620
got some terminology problems the

383
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,979
terminology for nodes in the path was

384
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,129
defined in our framework RFC host is a

385
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,770
computer capable of IP communications it

386
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,710
includes routers that's not bad

387
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:25,530
but wait a router is a host that

388
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,300
facilitates network where communication

389
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,649
between hosts and forwarding packets and

390
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,889
now it sounds like a router something

391
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:35,190
special in the middle then 8,200 which

392
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:39,800
you know is the bits of the original v6

393
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:42,510
document says a host is not a router but

394
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,340
but the definitions not paths specific

395
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,890
so you know we got some context thing

396
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,870
going on here and and in the mail like I

397
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,730
said to Frank and as a result of our

398
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,020
discussions in the hallway then Cerf

399
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,470
used to describe a router as a PC with a

400
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,660
graduate student wrapped around it

401
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,250
I'm thank you to vent for giving me a

402
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,470
chance to get a laugh

403
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,309
there is there's a lot of commonality

404
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,990
there with our host definition so in any

405
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,120
case let's let's look at this today

406
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,100
nodes in the path can be a coherent

407
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,040
compute environment so virtualized

408
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,530
within the computer all right so we got

409
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,230
some options I put them on the list feel

410
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,220
free to jump all over that for option a

411
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,550
retain host

412
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,850
add a new node term and definition so we

413
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,678
you know keep 20 through 30 as is a node

414
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,330
is any network function on the path

415
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,480
capable of IP alert communication

416
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:40,050
includes the 23 30 hosts on the other

417
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,330
hand we could revise host and use the

418
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,280
word node in a general way a node on the

419
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,689
path possessing a coherent compute

420
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,809
environment capable of IP layer

421
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:52,500
communication it also includes RFC 23 33

422
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:55,379
23 30 hosts and option C is the one you

423
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,310
suggest on the list or now really

424
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:03,030
quickly and creatively yet the Mike any

425
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:11,100
any preferences for these a B or keep

426
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:15,210
looking out see think I think the easy

427
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,810
fix that let's move from host to node

428
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:21,960
and see that we at least can align with

429
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:27,030
well what 8200 says and the more

430
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:29,820
moderate understanding physical like

431
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,770
just invent some new nomenclature and at

432
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:36,120
some point I think you need to do at

433
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:38,760
23:30 this I didn't really and I asked

434
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,070
around quite a bit before us writing an

435
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,140
email I didn't find a terminology

436
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,330
document for the ITF I think that's the

437
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,960
bigger problem where things like a note

438
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,399
host router are really clearly defined

439
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,900
and what they do and what they don't do

440
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,150
but otherwise I think some of the 8200

441
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,560
six men mess that happened from a

442
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:02,120
discussion perspective it's irrelevant

443
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,649
if you just referred to twenty to thirty

444
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,090
soon so I was getting to say the more

445
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,310
you talk the more work you're

446
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,310
volunteering to do so so stay up there

447
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:24,439
for what these good be is good okay okay

448
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:33,360
yep as somebody who is supposed to care

449
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,970
the RFC series as a whole twenty three

450
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,330
thirty long story Sarah banks for loops

451
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,860
yeah twenty three thirty says one thing

452
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,810
8200 says another however your next

453
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,280
slide so resolving at this point to me

454
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,200
you have a problem because if you're

455
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,600
suggesting to redefine it and then go

456
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,010
back through every IRC that has host in

457
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,500
it

458
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,700
no I'd be surprised you're suggesting so

459
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,800
if you're not going to do that and I

460
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,570
think you need the awesomest if you're

461
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:03,720
going to use hosts then to find what you

462
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:06,540
mean as host for your draft yeah I'm

463
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,220
kind of think node is clean and I really

464
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,110
cringed when I read the word computer

465
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:15,180
there in this day and age you know it

466
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:16,290
didn't bother me 1998 but it does now so

467
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,280
it sounds like C is

468
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:23,100
um drop hosts say node yeah yeah yeah

469
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,470
yeah okay all right can someone please

470
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,840
drop that in the minutes and we'll and

471
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,560
we'll think about see very good

472
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:38,429
um huh let's see yeah I'm probably out

473
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:41,100
of time right two more minutes cool okay

474
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,110
so let's see yeah we have to do some

475
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,300
work here to align the traceroute style

476
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,010
methods with the hybrid methods the

477
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,169
hybrid methods are much more reliable

478
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,470
ways in that almost everything is a

479
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:56,640
cooperating host in the in the tracing

480
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,930
path with with the trace route that

481
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,750
that's not always the case

482
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,100
so we'll seek ways to align this I kind

483
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,680
of think that some there's some

484
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,020
qualification of the statements in the

485
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,770
section you know like the one I've

486
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,540
quoted here they need to be qualified -

487
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:17,340
this is traceroute only kind of problem

488
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:23,190
something like that and then 53:38 is

489
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:29,370
our XML expression of traceroute output

490
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,810
basically route output and would be good

491
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,090
to at least get all the requirements for

492
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,639
an update I agree with that Frank it

493
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,470
would be better if we had an updated

494
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,320
data model as an IETF yang model that's

495
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:44,970
even more wonderful show of hands of who

496
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,139
would like to work on that okay but

497
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,660
we're gonna make that we're gonna make

498
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,060
that definitely different from the path

499
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,960
that this draft is on we'll assemble

500
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,399
their requirements the best we can and

501
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,400
hopefully others will put that together

502
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,990
at some future time maybe even these

503
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,020
offer authors when they can find a

504
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,280
minute so the next steps are the working

505
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,870
group weighs in on these key questions

506
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,260
we've got a we've got to leave some time

507
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:13,199
for the list on ABC and that includes

508
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,440
the questions in the texts are easy to

509
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,710
find there's some more areas for

510
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,990
development there and footer today foot

511
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,330
footer gave me his comments I've read

512
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,070
them footer I've got the response

513
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,290
conjured in my mind there's things we

514
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,510
can do there I like that you jumped

515
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,070
right on this and actually did more work

516
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,990
this morning after we talked that was

517
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,820
great I appreciate it thanks so much so

518
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,500
so both the reviewers from last time

519
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,689
checked in and actually did the reviews

520
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,840
reminders help folks this is what I've

521
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:47,070
learned I'm hoping for a working group

522
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,290
last call on this by 106 and co-authors

523
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,928
if you're out there please help al

524
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,030
please help out do the stuff that has

525
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:57,080
been proposed here thank you very much

526
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:59,879
any other questions are good questions

527
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,370
good so this seems to be this needs to

528
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,160
be progressing well so um yeah hopefully

529
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,090
we'll be done with this in Singapore

530
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,559
Singapore

531
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,770
let's we're going next yes that's right

532
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:24,870
good thank you alright multi point art

533
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:27,540
alt mark I'm just gonna everybody this

534
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:31,709
is an update about the multi point at

535
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:34,860
mark tuft we are at zero to version this

536
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:37,740
is just a recap about what is the motor

537
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,250
motivation for this work we started from

538
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,679
the base our FSC 8321 that presented the

539
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:47,640
point that is valid for point-to-point

540
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,549
flows and there is only one limitation

541
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,280
that if it works for point-to-point

542
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:55,860
flows or multicast flows we have to

543
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,110
select the v identification fields but

544
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:02,159
we want to introduce a methodology that

545
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:03,928
can be more general so we want to define

546
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,809
the identification field without any

547
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,640
constraint in this way we can monitor

548
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:12,000
for example an entire network or

549
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,490
multi-point flow so in this way but we

550
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,010
have to define a new approach for the

551
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,590
measurement the multi-point network can

552
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:22,230
be split into a cluster partition and

553
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,899
cluster partition can be combined in

554
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:28,740
different ways and this allow a more

555
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,230
flexible and intelligent we can say

556
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,270
performance measurement the draft

557
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:38,220
details also the algorithm for this

558
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:40,440
cluster partition so we call as I say

559
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,570
intelligent performance management

560
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,900
approach because we call the network

561
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,600
zooming in

562
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,330
a controller can calibrate and manage

563
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,879
the performance measurement it can start

564
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,639
without examining in depth our network

565
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,980
but so in the beginning we can monitor

566
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,780
just the full network from the input

567
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,940
from the ingress to the egress point and

568
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,670
in case of problem so if we experimented

569
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:09,010
some packet rows or the delay is two Ike

570
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,559
we can reconfigure the network we can

571
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:14,170
configure the clusters and we can make a

572
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:15,970
ditalion edit more detailed analysis and

573
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,100
we can act in two ways

574
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,650
or we can change change the traffic

575
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,889
filters or we can activate you

576
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,170
measurement points within our networks

577
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:30,190
this is just an example for packet rolls

578
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:33,670
so at the beginning we can activate the

579
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,700
counters only at the edge so the number

580
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:39,070
of ingress packet and numbers egress

581
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,730
packets is equal so packet loss is zero

582
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,230
the delay is less than necessary value

583
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,000
store everything is okay we don't need

584
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,990
to activate measurement points in the

585
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,470
middle it's okay if we have some packet

586
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,780
loss in our network we have to deepen

587
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,940
our analysis we can configure the

588
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,790
clustered partitions for example in this

589
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,830
network if we apply the algorithm that

590
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,100
we have also described during the last

591
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,428
meetings we find we can find four

592
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,559
clusters with four colors and if we

593
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:13,570
analyze and we if we calculate the

594
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,330
packet loss for each cluster we see that

595
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,639
for the red one we can experiment at the

596
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,669
part so we can focus the analysis for

597
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,800
the red clusters and in that case we

598
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:25,720
apply more specific traffic filter to

599
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,570
understand the part that is experimented

600
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,000
the loss so in this case and so we are

601
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,790
able to identify the fault

602
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,540
so this is just an example on how do you

603
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:39,309
apply this intelligent approach so in

604
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,470
general is a complete performance

605
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,420
measurement framework so this can be

606
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,750
applied not only for packet loss so we

607
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,400
can calculate no Tony Parker's

608
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,220
procrastinate or a combination of

609
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,760
clusters but also the delay measurement

610
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,650
apply to this kind of measurement and

611
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,840
the

612
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,990
but for the delay measurement we have

613
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,909
two different ways to worked the first

614
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,210
the first one is about the multi-point

615
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:09,150
at basis measurement in this case we can

616
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,309
calculate the mean delay that is

617
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:15,720
representative for all the multi-point

618
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:18,330
path or of our clusters okay we can

619
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,610
argue if that min delay can be useful or

620
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,649
not but there is also the second way

621
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,899
that is for single packet basis

622
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,360
measurement in this way in this case we

623
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,160
cannot use the double marking as in the

624
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,250
base their FEC 8321

625
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,100
but we can use the hashing approach but

626
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:38,100
they should approach some of us can can

627
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,290
know that has some problems because if

628
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,750
you have to identify the ashing values

629
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:46,830
the essence import can had some

630
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:50,040
difficulties but if you can correlate

631
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:53,280
help with correlations in terms of space

632
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,409
with the topological point of view by

633
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,870
using the clusters and in terms of time

634
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:01,559
by using the alternate marking that

635
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:04,530
creates the block of packets we can

636
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,840
easily make a correlation between the

637
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,928
symbols also in a multi point

638
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,030
environment so that's why we say it is a

639
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,940
complete frame so we analyze all the

640
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,820
alternatives we have to measure packet

641
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,910
loss to measure delay for multi point

642
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:24,419
paths for single single packet analysis

643
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:27,390
so what are the change from the zero one

644
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:30,540
version we make some consideration about

645
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:33,600
the overall architecture because we do

646
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,570
need to have a centralized management to

647
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,209
may to do some this intelligent approach

648
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,939
and we are the doors on some use cases

649
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:44,670
for example as the one the path

650
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,950
selection can be done also by analyzing

651
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,679
the cluster behaviors and this can help

652
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,130
also traffic visualization and topology

653
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,740
mapping okay I think the next steps for

654
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,940
in the opinion of the routers the

655
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:03,750
document content is quite stable so

656
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:07,570
let's we can value if we can consider

657
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:10,340
the path for reference so that's

658
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,300
there's a question on jabbered from

659
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,179
Ignacio

660
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,970
how are the clusters found the dragony

661
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,830
presents an example but to do that in a

662
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:24,020
distributed fashion is not trivial at

663
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:26,780
all exclamation point there is the

664
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,150
algorithms and unfortunately I don't

665
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,970
have the slide but there are several

666
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:36,050
algorithm that unfortunately there is a

667
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:39,170
paper that will be published in this

668
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:42,530
year probably in September and that will

669
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:44,900
details additional methodologies to find

670
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:47,500
a classic partition in the draft we

671
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,870
defined also be simple algorithms that

672
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,380
we can identify the sub networks in the

673
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,800
net

674
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:58,820
so the basic color it means that we have

675
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,790
to identify the cluster and the group of

676
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,980
nodes where the packet rows property is

677
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,659
still valid the packet rows property

678
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,880
means that the numbers of packets in

679
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:12,080
going is equal to the numbers of packets

680
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:16,730
outgoing of the that is the basic way

681
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:24,649
and there are different algorithm n't

682
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:27,140
this this partition yeah yeah I will not

683
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,110
of course the reference to the paper but

684
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:33,320
is not public for now so but in the next

685
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:37,100
revision I will do of course is in the

686
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,960
plan okay so your easy beginning the

687
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,129
path there come RFC can you give these

688
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,650
out a little bit more what you mean

689
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,650
there so it sounds like you've got

690
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:49,820
feedback that there's some missing

691
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:51,650
detail come in the next Rev are there

692
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,629
are other things that you expect to put

693
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,330
in the document before we could go for a

694
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,190
working group last call I think the

695
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,370
reference to this paper it will be

696
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:07,630
important if we wind is that it

697
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:19,629
published in an ethically networking

698
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:19,630
when in September so yeah 2023 um

699
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,580
yeah not that bad okay so that that's

700
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,750
the reference yeah no great yo you

701
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,820
wanted to be published before he had the

702
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,980
reference to it because yeah even as an

703
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,270
even as an informative reference if it's

704
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,190
informative referenced we think nobody

705
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:40,889
can get to that's not useful okay good

706
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,630
okay so we'll bring this back I guess

707
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:45,330
quickly next time

708
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:59,820
and then talking about moving a fort

709
00:33:45,330 --> 00:34:00,720
excellent okay Justin good afternoon

710
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,939
everyone

711
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,970
so as you're married you know my talk

712
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:11,190
will focus on the invitation of IOM for

713
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:14,370
ipv6 inside the Linux kernel so how does

714
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,740
it look like well the very first design

715
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:20,029
goal was obviously to have zero a

716
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:22,979
location during packet processing so

717
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:28,110
everything needed for REM is allocated

718
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:31,010
at node registration so for instance we

719
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:34,620
allocate IOM names basis data and

720
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:38,820
related extension errors to be a

721
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:43,080
capsulated with IOM adores inside it and

722
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,930
much more we also took advantage of the

723
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:50,370
current parsing of extension headers of

724
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:55,159
the kernel by improving it and adding

725
00:34:50,370 --> 00:35:00,290
some useful info that would allow us to

726
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,290
ease and fast and decapsulation process

727
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:08,120
for that we store for instance the total

728
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,120
padding size of an extension header and

729
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:14,670
during iron bar Singh we also saw

730
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:18,580
offsets and size of each IOM blocks so

731
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,380
each option to be removed obviously

732
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,259
and at the bottom of the slide you can

733
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,120
see a graphical representation of the

734
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,990
data structure we've used to represent

735
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:31,450
an extension header so here it's generic

736
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:35,140
it can either be a PI up or a

737
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:39,899
destination option and this one is

738
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:44,650
stored at each i/o interface which must

739
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:47,440
encapsulate IOM headers and you can also

740
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:50,020
see some data offsets in red and

741
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:54,460
actually when a node encapsulate I am

742
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:57,400
headers it also needs to insert its IOM

743
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:01,210
data and that's a way to further note to

744
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,460
remember what option is and where it

745
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:07,330
needs to insert the data corresponding

746
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:10,060
to that option so what we got from

747
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,370
measurements well those are still early

748
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,490
results but we can already learn a lot

749
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:17,680
from them at the top we can see the

750
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,799
topology we have used for measurements

751
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,080
and actually for measurements that I

752
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,020
will show you we have just used a

753
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,930
portion of this topology so forget about

754
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,530
what's outside and the cloud so just

755
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,970
focus on what's inside iron domain and

756
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:39,310
the reason for that is that we want it

757
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:42,879
to be compliant with the RFC h200 which

758
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:46,960
says that you cannot invite insert or

759
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,320
remove extension headers so this way we

760
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,320
generate an a-cup to the traffic I am

761
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,880
traffic inside the I am doing on the

762
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:00,180
same node at the Bahamas so for the left

763
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,470
graph you can see a comparison between

764
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:08,020
Tropos measured the first one is for a

765
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:10,689
vanilla kernel so without touching

766
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:15,040
anything the second one is for a patch

767
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:18,340
kernel with I am so this is just a patch

768
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,590
that is compiled but totally passive and

769
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,740
the last one is for a patch criminal

770
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:26,770
with IOM this time with notes at all

771
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:28,629
registered so it's really the last one

772
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,030
that is interesting and we can come

773
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,760
the first one with the last one and I'm

774
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:37,210
sure you can see a small drop of around

775
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,240
seven percent and this is not that huge

776
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:43,660
especially when you know that this may

777
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,899
not be the most realistic case indeed in

778
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:50,080
this case we insert iron bidders into

779
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,480
any packets we see so by definition of

780
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,590
IOM I think so that's my point I think

781
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,740
that you should not insert at Iometer

782
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:02,230
stats any packet so that's why I wanted

783
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:05,259
to measure another thing the impact of

784
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,320
percentage of insertion and you can see

785
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:12,250
on the bottom right graph that between

786
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,440
zero and twenty percent of insertion you

787
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,590
are still quite you're still quite good

788
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,750
performance then it starts dropping

789
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:22,810
until fifty percent and then it's

790
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,600
remained stable until one hundred

791
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:28,480
percent so I think that's my advice to

792
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,700
any operators that would implement this

793
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,550
and configure this and my advice would

794
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,060
be to limit the percentage effect or

795
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:41,020
insertion to at maximum too many persons

796
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:43,720
I think I'm gonna skip this one because

797
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:48,100
I think I'm gonna run out of time

798
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:50,560
so this one is discussion all of you and

799
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,069
the first op topic is actually the

800
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,049
opaque state snapshot option we had a

801
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:59,010
lot of discussion with Frank and shmita

802
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:02,010
and also a term during the hackathon and

803
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,570
I think we all agree on the fact that

804
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:08,290
something needs to be changed on that

805
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,790
option it status it's quite unclear

806
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,520
especially when you are in a

807
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,950
pre-allocated context because all it

808
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,040
does is actually break the idea of

809
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:21,629
provocation so I get the whole point of

810
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,980
this option but I think they need some

811
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,890
discussion and improvement to end up

812
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,920
with something very good the second one

813
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:33,279
is more I just wanted your opinion on

814
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,820
that would you see some interests of

815
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,010
having the incremental trace mode

816
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,190
enabled inside the kernel because my

817
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,770
point is I don't worry thing

818
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,960
that will be good because this is not a

819
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:50,250
performance solution at all in the

820
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:55,589
kernel and I don't think that operators

821
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:57,530
would use it by knowing that and so yeah

822
00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:01,170
I just wanted your opinion on that and

823
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:04,349
the last one is about the new version

824
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:06,210
that we will just merge on the

825
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,730
repository which will be totally

826
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:10,890
compliant with the RFC and one of the

827
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,770
solution was to use ipv6 Turner

828
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:18,049
encapsulation but this solution also

829
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:21,960
brings a lot of let's call them some

830
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:25,079
small issues and the first one is that

831
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,020
you could you may have a leak of iom

832
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,700
data so let's think about a scenario

833
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,770
when you have overlapping channels and

834
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,899
for instance I'm a node and I'm

835
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:36,509
configured to the capsulate iron

836
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,460
namespace to for instance but this

837
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:43,049
namespace is also encapsulate it in

838
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:46,230
other one so it is in a inner header and

839
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:48,869
I'm I cannot see that so I will just let

840
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:51,750
it go and this is almost the same idea

841
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:54,750
for the second point the scenario is

842
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,730
with that nested to nose so again I'm a

843
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:01,529
node and I'm configure to insert my data

844
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:04,440
if I see the IMS - and again I can't see

845
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:09,599
it because it's inside so I will not

846
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,220
insert my data I just forward it so

847
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,140
someone told me that for the second

848
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,618
point it's totally fair because who

849
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:19,348
knows actually like that so you could

850
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:22,200
just ignore what's inside and I tend to

851
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:25,470
agree because it's easier for me and it

852
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:28,020
makes life easier but I think you should

853
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:32,279
take into account that operators may

854
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,980
want to configure such a configuration

855
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:38,569
such ever sorry I have such a

856
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:41,819
configuration and they still wanted to

857
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:45,799
have each node inserted their their data

858
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:48,339
so I think again there is room for

859
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:50,769
discussion on that point

860
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:54,400
and the last one actually when you

861
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:57,459
encapsulate IOM headers well you have to

862
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,009
know what the destination is so right

863
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,450
now this is a static configuration but

864
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:04,029
it would be nice to have something based

865
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:07,029
on the routing so I was thinking at

866
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:09,279
first as something like a signaling

867
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:12,849
protocol like LTP or something like that

868
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:16,029
I think they are certainly exist other

869
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:19,779
easier solutions without reinventing the

870
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:22,989
wheel so I'll be happy to share on the

871
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:27,460
mailing list or here or whatever on

872
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:29,200
those important points thank you you can

873
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,869
find the code as a patch for the color

874
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:41,739
on this repo and feel free to drop me an

875
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:43,450
email if you have any question this one

876
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:46,180
so how come there is almost no

877
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:49,058
difference between 50% and hundred

878
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,419
hundred percent well actually yeah it's

879
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:54,549
a bit surprising but we have no real

880
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,559
explanation because actually what was

881
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:59,109
the difference between the two it's you

882
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,239
insert one of our two packets and the

883
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:04,538
other you insert in every packet so I

884
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:21,450
guess the difference is not that that

885
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:27,130
big giving in term of delay so the

886
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:30,189
increase in the package yeah okay so

887
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:34,529
maybe you're talking about those I kept

888
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:38,249
it for as a backup so when you increase

889
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:41,559
the trace actually the kernel will

890
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:47,109
reallocate some space so that's why you

891
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:49,499
see some drop during the process how

892
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:52,180
many bytes did you add for each packets

893
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:54,990
actually the best the common base case

894
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,350
was a single IO namespace

895
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,970
a single trace option and from that we

896
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:03,118
increase the number of choice option

897
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:09,029
inside a single namespace or we increase

898
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:19,470
the number of namespace it depends on

899
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:22,170
the use case repository and there is a

900
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:24,209
paper related to that so yeah

901
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:31,350
monitors are on the mailing list you can

902
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:34,820
send me an email about the incremental

903
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:40,140
option in my opinion it is very useful

904
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:42,570
the incremental Romania yes so quite a

905
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:46,589
few of the switches and routers out

906
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:48,540
there that implement IOM have an easier

907
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,330
time doing this using the incremental

908
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:56,970
trace option okay that's useful in my

909
00:44:51,330 --> 00:45:02,520
thing okay we're cutting a line out for

910
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:04,410
a baton what song tell us earlier point

911
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,140
I would second that incremental is

912
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,660
useful for the very reason if you really

913
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,129
have I am started on the host and then

914
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,990
really connected a fabric that does

915
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,490
incremental maybe you don't want to go

916
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:18,089
into that mode where you mixing

917
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,709
incremental and pre-allocate it in the

918
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,140
very same packet which is what otherwise

919
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,780
probably do so I do believe that there

920
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,299
is a use for doing from that goal yeah

921
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,220
the host despite the fact that well if

922
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,160
you just have forwarding hosts that are

923
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,080
all software an old kernel based yeah

924
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,480
well even argue whether that's useful I

925
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,810
think the mixture libraries as easy as

926
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:43,190
well the other point on kind of blaming

927
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:45,960
opaque we've done all that for awhile I

928
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,570
think there is a way to go and at least

929
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,690
contain the problem and containing the

930
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:57,540
problem might be using the profile idea

931
00:45:51,690 --> 00:46:01,320
that tell came up with where you say

932
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:03,390
well if I know that my nodes are not

933
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,460
inputting random data but I can go on

934
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:06,509
three to find that and I could do the

935
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,080
length project

936
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:12,780
and calculations upfront so loads of the

937
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,220
variety that you can dream of doesn't

938
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,810
really happen and we ought to be people

939
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:20,640
drop offs and a final ask for you to

940
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:23,009
comment on so when you did that for the

941
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,500
5:12 kernel what's your kind could you

942
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,750
shed some light on what you're gonna go

943
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:32,070
do with getting that into master luxury

944
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:34,020
yeah if anything so we plan to have a

945
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:52,530
package for newer versions and try to

946
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:54,660
make it go upstream at one point we do

947
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,360
need an option number in order to get

948
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,970
upstream this is the same problem that

949
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:01,950
pathum to you is seeing today I took min

950
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,350
there is something called early I Anna

951
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:06,060
in a location that might be applicable

952
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,610
here it's probably more appropriate for

953
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:11,130
the authors of the draft but that might

954
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:18,120
be something we could get this actually

955
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:42,440
into deployment all right thank you very

956
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:45,150
much um Frank can you come on up okay so

957
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,310
given is an update I thought about kind

958
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:50,310
of doing the story that you were allowed

959
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:51,870
to do earlier on so we saw that the

960
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:54,420
strip which is a journey apparently

961
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:58,380
three years ago and I think together we

962
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:00,800
came quite a long way so it's the fine

963
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,060
print but that's the Shetty old lab the

964
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,340
quote-unquote data draft went through so

965
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:11,400
we started in Berlin and in ITF 96 and

966
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,170
we became after doing the shopping tour

967
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,320
across multiple working groups and

968
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:18,180
trading ops AWG and whatever even the

969
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,059
the discussion whether we need a working

970
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:23,058
group for the work

971
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:25,490
we finally arrived and I think that's

972
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:29,450
also thanks to the white knight like I

973
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:30,859
call her the our dear ID Miriam who came

974
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,808
up with a suggestion that will hand it

975
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:36,259
in i PRI ppm and I think that was a

976
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:38,539
really good idea so we landed in AI ppm

977
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,730
and we've been progressing since then

978
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:42,680
and we've been having regular updates so

979
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,440
this the whole thing went through a

980
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:48,259
journey I think it got significally

981
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:51,260
richer wider broader better over the

982
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,730
course of the last two years and I don't

983
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,760
want to be one side everything but I

984
00:48:52,730 --> 00:49:00,289
think if anybody wants to go and reuse

985
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,420
the story I created a slide for you 104

986
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:04,220
was in Prague but otherwise I love that

987
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,660
graphic I was like you went to Bangkok

988
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:11,959
twice copy and paste it's not my friend

989
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:18,190
I'm sorry could you fix that it's a

990
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:21,980
Google Doc we just changed the location

991
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,779
anyway so where are we at a very high

992
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:27,319
level kind of what is the ecosystem

993
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:28,789
looking like and I'm sorry if not every

994
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:30,829
single draft is up there but I think

995
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:33,410
those were the ones that kind of got

996
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:36,020
discussed quite a bit from a data fields

997
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,640
perspective and the flag stuff let's

998
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,579
table that for a minute we'll discuss

999
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,098
that in detail we had a recent mailing

1000
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:44,930
list discussion on immediate export

1001
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:47,930
postcard I think we have a good

1002
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:50,270
resolution for that which means get rid

1003
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:53,538
of the flag that we have for immediate

1004
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:56,630
export and write a new draft that is

1005
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:59,839
dedicated for postcard slash immediate

1006
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:03,470
export that just defines that one new

1007
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:04,880
option to go and handle that case so we

1008
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:08,328
just need to see the document like

1009
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,980
future reference but I think there is at

1010
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:12,339
least resolution on the way forward or

1011
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:15,500
we want to go would do would this one

1012
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:18,140
then we've been seeing quite a bit of

1013
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,809
kind of background work the documents

1014
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,180
been progressing we've not seen a lot of

1015
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:26,029
discussion around it but we have a yang

1016
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:29,359
document for IOM it's better for a while

1017
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:32,299
and it's also been updated and kind of

1018
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,990
fix has been worked into that so maybe I

1019
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:34,910
think

1020
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,410
at some point maybe now we should go and

1021
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:40,098
ask the question do we want to go and

1022
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:42,348
adopt it chance work I mentioned that at

1023
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:44,990
the mic earlier on around the profile

1024
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:47,869
work I think is a little early I think

1025
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,339
it needs more maturing so I think we we

1026
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:51,800
can go probably have a couple of

1027
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:53,900
iterations there we had the discussion

1028
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,450
around data export earlier on and ops

1029
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,869
iwg and I think the conclusion was that

1030
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:03,319
there wasn't one but that people want

1031
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:05,150
more peer reviews on the document and

1032
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:09,619
then decide whether we really want to go

1033
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:12,770
and land it in ops AWG or here or and

1034
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:15,170
that's what what higness brought up as

1035
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,420
an option is as an ad sponsor document

1036
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:20,690
so that this is an even need working

1037
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:23,720
group adoption for that specific case so

1038
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:27,440
that's another thing but the baseline is

1039
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,930
more peer review because well it hasn't

1040
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,070
had enough reviews so far I think that

1041
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,680
was the conclusion from the disc

1042
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:36,080
discussion so far so it was a forward

1043
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:40,009
reference from the meeting that we had

1044
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,859
104 in Bangkok right but where we

1045
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,510
discussed like ops aw geez should go and

1046
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:50,029
take a look whether they want to pick it

1047
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:54,140
up the conclusion was go and read the

1048
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:56,839
document and send mail to the list which

1049
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,980
brings me to the area that we touched on

1050
00:51:56,839 --> 00:51:59,930
earlier on

1051
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,710
we're just this encapsulation laundry

1052
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:07,430
list we talked to six men post the last

1053
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:10,550
I ppm meeting the the feet was back was

1054
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:12,230
good and saying well go and progress it

1055
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:15,109
and come back frequently and give us an

1056
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,849
update on where you are but we're happy

1057
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:19,160
that you do the work because we had

1058
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,650
precedents earlier on that it worked out

1059
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,690
well that kind of cooperation and Brian

1060
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:28,520
mentioned that earlier on between six

1061
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:31,760
men and and I ppm skipping the next one

1062
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,720
for a for a bit of a minute and Sh

1063
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,820
SFC working group genève and vo three

1064
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:44,180
segments routings being presented

1065
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:47,030
if we're lucky in spring and also in in

1066
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,970
six-man I think

1067
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,860
mpls I think is progressing in MPLS we

1068
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,720
excellent GPE doesn't have a home and

1069
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,900
ITF so we'll probably go and publish

1070
00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:00,290
that as an individual RFC at some point

1071
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:03,380
once stable which brings us back to the

1072
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:04,730
question that I'm always asked and that

1073
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,320
question that I'm always asked it

1074
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:08,720
doesn't really have a good answer and

1075
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:14,810
you mentioned that earlier on is what do

1076
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:17,029
we do with V 4 V 4 options well we kind

1077
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,730
of test that the water people didn't

1078
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:22,610
like it including you and I understand

1079
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:27,800
why sorry we need other people sorry

1080
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:28,640
about the other people that we don't

1081
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,980
know

1082
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,290
there is restrictions that are pretty

1083
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:36,290
hard around that which means like mmm

1084
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:38,960
problem space constraints that you have

1085
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,540
with options may may render it only

1086
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,510
nichy for certain cases there is work to

1087
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:47,570
go and solve the problem a completely

1088
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:49,730
different way Tom mentioned not here

1089
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:52,310
about earlier on in other venues the

1090
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:55,850
work on putting extension headers into

1091
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:59,330
v4 hmm yeah might solve our problem but

1092
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:02,390
we need something for v4 and the best

1093
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:05,779
current thing is a kludge which means

1094
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:07,370
you slap on eight unnecessary bytes so

1095
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,920
that you can slap on the IOM header

1096
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:13,819
which is the either typing capsulation

1097
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,280
that would also go and cater for other

1098
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:21,980
protocols like genève so that same

1099
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:24,230
option we can go there plus well the

1100
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:28,040
discussion that we had is we can only

1101
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:30,230
get an either type if isg asks through a

1102
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:33,050
liaison to it-- I Triple E for an either

1103
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:35,180
type and that requires that we have a

1104
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:37,490
working group adopt the document that

1105
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,049
asks for that either type so there is a

1106
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:42,020
little bit of a wrong way ahead of us

1107
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:44,870
and question is do we want to go and

1108
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:48,560
take that effort I have not seen too

1109
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:51,470
many lovers of GRE but well it's the

1110
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:56,320
best acceptable option that I know of

1111
00:54:51,470 --> 00:55:00,348
that is somewhat fitting into IETF

1112
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,359
overall general rules the other option

1113
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:04,700
would be to go and see what else we can

1114
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:07,549
go do about before and well that's

1115
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:10,249
extension headers for before we can ask

1116
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:13,369
for an i/o and protocol type to go IP

1117
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:17,419
protocol type to go and just well have

1118
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:21,109
one-size-fits-all probably harder than

1119
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,789
either type so I think we need ideas and

1120
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:25,788
maybe here at the mic but also maybe

1121
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:30,739
broader on the list on how to solve the

1122
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:33,249
v4 question in a somewhat reasonable way

1123
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:38,239
let me pause here

1124
00:55:33,249 --> 00:55:42,200
Tom so before we get into that question

1125
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,930
I do want to point out that Tunis and VX

1126
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:48,140
LAN or UDP encapsulations correct so the

1127
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:54,799
idea is we're gonna go into unity

1128
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:57,200
payload and do the IOM or is it

1129
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:00,890
something else I'd okay it's outside so

1130
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,680
it's not so it's it's we're than

1131
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:08,719
deviates so with VX LAN we chained that

1132
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,339
in with either type or in in geni if you

1133
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:14,619
chain that in with either type or you

1134
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:17,089
used the genève capability to carry Tod

1135
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:18,859
so those options exists right so you

1136
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:28,489
could do it natively in Geneva you want

1137
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:30,979
to and if you're identifying in the

1138
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:33,499
network to need can your change in you

1139
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:39,919
to be a load it's unfortunately a bad

1140
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:41,209
thing yeah we know that those things we

1141
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,549
had to come up with this crazy magic

1142
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:45,200
number so I'm not sure if that's what

1143
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:50,150
these are intended there's may not be

1144
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,859
feasible in the long run and then so yes

1145
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:55,519
I didn't mention the idea I gave before

1146
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:57,828
extension headers that is possible if

1147
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:01,008
the choice was between that and creating

1148
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:02,569
a new IP protocol number I would say use

1149
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:07,849
the existing one I think that's actually

1150
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:11,140
going to be a lower part and I'm a

1151
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:13,510
little confused about the ether type but

1152
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:18,180
this would be hop-by-hop options

1153
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:18,180
but and I peed before hopping up often

1154
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,959
[Music]

1155
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:32,410
yeah - Brian Trammell as an individualís

1156
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,900
rising we say you do that that seems

1157
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:37,299
right to video um yeah so actually I

1158
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:39,070
came up here to say like so the the

1159
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,880
problem here is that what you want is

1160
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:44,890
the lowest overhead way to wedge io am

1161
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,210
header it would be for packet for things

1162
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:49,930
that are going to be underneath inning

1163
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:53,080
before correct yep and and a path that

1164
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:56,109
is quote unquote workable and the ITF

1165
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:58,029
that's very important office between

1166
00:57:56,109 --> 00:58:01,529
number of bytes on the wire a number ye

1167
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:10,000
a number of years working for meetings

1168
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:13,660
great so I hate to say this but I think

1169
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:17,920
the thing that's there is GRE sorry to

1170
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:19,390
say so Jerry in V for hmm is I mean

1171
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,680
weeks are thing what is the easiest way

1172
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,359
to get a thing that's if you're kind of

1173
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,460
identified in before it it's dirty right

1174
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:26,710
yeah but it's the most hated option that

1175
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:32,020
we have right its way but because it's

1176
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:33,910
the only one great but you're already

1177
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,380
like the difficulty of doing this for

1178
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,670
the new protocol number is that you're

1179
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,430
not gonna get a protocol number because

1180
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,869
nobody believes them anymore and there

1181
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,910
aren't that many of them right like so

1182
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:46,630
they are both useless and rare therefore

1183
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:48,759
you can't have one but we already have

1184
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:52,619
one for for the hop-by-hop options

1185
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:56,320
header that is undefined in v4 space I

1186
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:58,570
don't necessarily one strike you can

1187
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,450
take that to six man

1188
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:04,080
but why six and I have more coffee on

1189
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:06,339
the six man work on me for extensions I

1190
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:10,210
mean right so you're gonna do this

1191
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:13,470
anyway right stuff using using v6

1192
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:17,590
extension headers in the court yeah yeah

1193
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:20,020
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom will do the work for

1194
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:24,120
you yeah and you he'll just

1195
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:24,120
have a kernel right so that's the thing

1196
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,000
if there's enough traction so I didn't

1197
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,050
post the ipv4 extension headers and it

1198
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,600
was quite interesting to see the

1199
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:40,600
feedback primary concern is oh we're

1200
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:43,240
improving ipv4 and I thought we were

1201
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:45,160
sunsetting it and yet the operators we

1202
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,830
operated came back and said I still have

1203
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,990
customer as an ipv4 so we have to keep

1204
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:57,009
improving it so it may be less of a

1205
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:58,990
technical question anymore Tom just for

1206
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,240
information now where are you doing the

1207
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:04,169
work on this because I wasn't clear from

1208
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:09,910
the document which group per year doing

1209
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:11,710
yeah I posted it a 6-man I'll kind of

1210
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:14,920
copán that they could take that but it's

1211
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:16,270
not really I give you sense right so the

1212
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,910
next question and then the problem is

1213
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:25,000
there's no format so it was really no

1214
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:29,160
and so I didn't pursue it too much it'd

1215
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,160
be a big amount of discussion related

1216
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,330
but if this is what we're suggesting to

1217
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:36,430
kind of tied together to this solution

1218
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:39,670
we wouldn't need to know like where's

1219
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:42,810
where is that going to be worked on yeah

1220
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,810
because I don't think it would be here

1221
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:56,649
yeah so that's not really GRE then we're

1222
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:06,100
actually doing it yeah you use GRE to

1223
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:08,860
put a new either type that's basically

1224
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,960
the GRE was using cheeri to abuse the

1225
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,820
GRE header to read an ether type into an

1226
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,840
ipv4 header in the same way that we are

1227
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:19,840
using abusing the protocol number for a

1228
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:22,420
header to wedge up and extend v6

1229
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:26,290
extension header in the v4 the same kind

1230
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:28,120
of abuse but-but-but-but yes but your I

1231
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:30,190
mean your design is a hell of a lot

1232
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:33,140
cleaner

1233
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:34,610
by the way I'm gonna cut the line on

1234
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,109
this one and it's a time check we have

1235
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:38,600
like four or five minutes left to

1236
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,970
discuss this and and I still have the

1237
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,009
update to the draft yeah yeah so let's

1238
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:45,169
let's try to make these quick I've been

1239
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,450
away for four years I've met athis been

1240
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:49,670
away for four years and so I'm losing a

1241
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:53,689
little bit contacts are you aware of an

1242
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:56,530
old protocol called AI PMP it died on

1243
01:01:53,690 --> 01:02:00,710
the vine probably in this working group

1244
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:04,160
probably about 15 years ago so I'm not

1245
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:06,170
even aware of it so it it died on the

1246
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,180
pressure personal in the process error

1247
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:10,780
because it accidentally forked and then

1248
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:13,609
the two communities couldn't agree I

1249
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:15,170
p.m. he was in many resembled was in

1250
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,700
many ways but one of the things that

1251
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:20,240
they did that was kind of a hack

1252
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:24,618
Noel seis extremely was a hack is they

1253
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:26,060
used magic numbers in the payload so the

1254
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:29,510
hardware could find the measurement

1255
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:32,180
object and the rule was that the

1256
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:33,830
measurement object enemas or checksum so

1257
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:36,169
you can have a measurement object had

1258
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:37,310
its own the offset checksum and the

1259
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,740
hardware guy said yeah they can do this

1260
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:42,020
in ships no problem you can put a

1261
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,549
measurement measure commit the

1262
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,190
application has to know that the data

1263
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:48,320
isn't real but you can make do

1264
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:51,590
measurements then with streams that

1265
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:54,400
mimic arbitrary other applications find

1266
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:56,720
the cookie announced of whatever it is

1267
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,910
updated on the fly going through the

1268
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:06,259
hardware correct the checksum at the end

1269
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:07,640
and send it on its act however nobody

1270
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,980
can detect that you're doing the

1271
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,250
measurement necessarily I mean you can

1272
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,290
do it

1273
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:17,480
install the weights and so on that's

1274
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:19,779
bunch of advantages I just did to point

1275
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,970
out we also have will work on ipv6

1276
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:26,600
encapsulation for Iowa it is also listed

1277
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:29,509
in the agenda the last one and basically

1278
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,299
if we want to put the Iowa data in the

1279
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:34,940
hopper hoc the options header and there

1280
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:38,090
may be a risk especially for the

1281
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:40,670
incremental tracing mode so the data may

1282
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:42,920
become very large so there is a risk

1283
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:44,420
risk to push

1284
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,089
working Heather out of the passing

1285
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,609
window on the chip so our proposal is to

1286
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:52,640
separate at the instruction part and the

1287
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:54,740
data part and to place the data part

1288
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,970
after the rockin Heather in another

1289
01:03:54,740 --> 01:04:01,240
maybe I will six metadata yeah just

1290
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,240
drive

1291
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:06,650
you'll be profile I wanted from for the

1292
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:09,559
one suggestion I think you know that's

1293
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:13,099
the IO hammer time you're very pretty

1294
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:15,349
sure I hope that later we can confine

1295
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:17,990
our discussion on that you capsulation

1296
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:20,930
because they use a to market time you

1297
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:24,020
think we can focus on the IOM Heather

1298
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:26,058
it's a sale because I will father like

1299
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:29,089
this one I know that I'm chars also

1300
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:33,680
several the options how I'm Heather and

1301
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:36,950
also maybe the tre I don't like this one

1302
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,480
so you can we I think I mean I cannot

1303
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:43,910
afford us on my walk I came more time

1304
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:47,180
for the Iowa had yourself so then we can

1305
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:52,700
maybe how you give independent second in

1306
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:56,118
Casablanca - cut me in Catalan Jack as I

1307
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:58,368
see excitement to change IP before from

1308
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:01,869
the chairs maybe consider the options

1309
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:09,260
this is the only backward compatible

1310
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:13,700
solution it's like I wish you luck in in

1311
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:15,490
getting that passed the is gee I'll bet

1312
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:18,799
against it but I wish you luck

1313
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:20,089
okay alright so I think as I said like

1314
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,609
it needs to be something that is

1315
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:27,049
workable within the balance of the

1316
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:30,290
entire lol let me go and progress to the

1317
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:31,790
two documents that are I think core and

1318
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,650
center and that's kind of the core

1319
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:35,839
document that we started the journey on

1320
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:38,059
three years ago line that I PBM is

1321
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:41,450
working on since two years if you look

1322
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:45,369
at the key updates we've done a little

1323
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:50,899
bit of editorial cleanup and we've done

1324
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:52,339
text specific to the flags where we

1325
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,510
really have beyond that was the only

1326
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:56,390
piece of discussion that we had in

1327
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:58,369
Prague that well fly

1328
01:05:56,390 --> 01:06:00,170
were not really not everybody was

1329
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:01,579
comfortable with what the flags are how

1330
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:03,769
they were used and the likes and we've

1331
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:05,150
seen even on immediate export that we

1332
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:07,129
already came to a new conclusion that a

1333
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:08,690
resolution for that and that we moved

1334
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,460
that out and found that stuff out and to

1335
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:12,529
dedicate a document why because we

1336
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,480
wanted to go on separate the stuff that

1337
01:06:12,529 --> 01:06:15,910
is in discussion from the stuff that is

1338
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,989
really stable so that we can really

1339
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,868
settle the stuff that is really stable

1340
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:22,700
which is the date arrived so there's a

1341
01:06:20,869 --> 01:06:26,769
couple of FICA I post that are fakes and

1342
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:28,519
I've did done in that update one

1343
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:31,399
clarification

1344
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:34,669
well.tell actually have to get the patch

1345
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,869
one clarification on how the namespaces

1346
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:38,119
are used because there was some

1347
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:41,779
confusion we got from the discussion

1348
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:43,369
that said well some people interpreter

1349
01:06:41,779 --> 01:06:45,079
that from discussions that I had with

1350
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:47,029
people implementing the thing like if I

1351
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:48,499
use namespace one I have to go and

1352
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:49,999
follow the document if I use a different

1353
01:06:48,499 --> 01:06:52,549
name space number I can do whatever I

1354
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:54,799
want that wasn't the idea of a namespace

1355
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:56,538
the namespace idea was that it gives you

1356
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:58,788
more context to the fields that we have

1357
01:06:56,539 --> 01:07:00,589
defined that's what we're saying now

1358
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:03,349
right so I think that makes obvious

1359
01:07:00,589 --> 01:07:05,660
sense but just making sure that it's not

1360
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:08,329
misinterpreted the other thing is the

1361
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:13,549
the document split so all the sections

1362
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:17,029
that touched flags have been farmed out

1363
01:07:13,549 --> 01:07:20,390
to tells new document so whenever

1364
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:22,299
something Flags was discussed so flags

1365
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:24,769
that are real flags like active

1366
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:28,849
immediate export and then loop back they

1367
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:32,779
were found out from a document

1368
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:34,430
perspective excluding the flags now well

1369
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:35,809
there weren't really updates and it's

1370
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:37,879
relatively stable and there has been

1371
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:39,859
very few additional proposals I think

1372
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,769
the big last real big debate on the

1373
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:44,239
whole data fields document was the

1374
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:48,859
introduction of namespace and that's

1375
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:51,440
kind of now money many moons ago so from

1376
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:53,598
my perspective and nothing multiple

1377
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,299
people voiced the very same opinion it's

1378
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,579
ready for working glue blast coal and

1379
01:07:56,299 --> 01:08:02,089
maybe we can go and home on that if

1380
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:06,049
that's ok but there is a question

1381
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:09,349
earlier I do have a suggestion on the

1382
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:10,130
field so on the on the flags or the data

1383
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:14,569
fields

1384
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:18,880
infuse okay I captured this my lunch I I

1385
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:23,868
just find their cell checks on

1386
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:27,799
complementor fuel in the fuel I think it

1387
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:31,068
a bit fuel is use the two indicator that

1388
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:34,158
the data need to be shipped out to the

1389
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:39,380
controller or collector so it's kind of

1390
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:44,210
confused people - there's the masturbate

1391
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:47,389
is used to indicate the sister took some

1392
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:50,630
compliment so I'm not I'm not to say

1393
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:54,139
this isn't not useful I just would say

1394
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:57,790
maybe we need to use it another bit for

1395
01:08:54,139 --> 01:09:05,719
example in the flag to indicate there's

1396
01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:07,609
just some commitment so he won't the

1397
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:10,759
second indication that the checksum

1398
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:14,449
complement is there yeah I think some

1399
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:16,698
compliments should be being flag words

1400
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:19,519
or other places are not in the data

1401
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:21,919
Fuchs because I think that the data

1402
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,650
feels is to indicate what kind of data

1403
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:32,569
need to be captured and finally shipped

1404
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:34,879
out to that okay

1405
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:36,549
maybe you can go and send an email to

1406
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,109
the list on that one so that we can go

1407
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:40,790
yesterday on the list so I think the

1408
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:43,400
argument is not is we're not really no

1409
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:45,560
data but it's kind of operational data

1410
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:47,299
to help the overall thing work and hence

1411
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,940
you want to go and use it in a slightly

1412
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:53,330
different way than the operational data

1413
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:57,049
okay I can I think it's a different type

1414
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:59,960
of data that we insert given that it's

1415
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:01,760
just to help operations sorry tell I

1416
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,940
think tell was though the one who

1417
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,530
brought that option in yeah same thing

1418
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:14,299
at this point we define the flags as the

1419
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:17,230
separate field which in terms of the

1420
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:21,590
timeline may be defined later than

1421
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:23,419
actually publishing so we want to

1422
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,520
separate

1423
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:28,750
any functionality which is related to

1424
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:34,040
actually parsing the earth from the

1425
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:36,050
flags which different thing so I think

1426
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,390
at this point it's pretty clear that the

1427
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:42,680
bitmap is used for specifying which

1428
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:44,840
fields are in the option and that's why

1429
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:48,050
in my opinion it's more convenient to

1430
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:59,900
have a checksum complement indication in

1431
01:10:48,050 --> 01:11:06,140
the Robert I have a couple comments on

1432
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:09,530
this one near peg data is somewhat

1433
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,630
awkward a variable variable length field

1434
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:13,190
right in the middle of this bit field so

1435
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,860
we probably would think about

1436
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:17,929
restructuring that another interesting

1437
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:19,940
thing was for some of the fields there's

1438
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:23,420
both like a shorter field and a white

1439
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:25,759
field what happens if both of those are

1440
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:27,800
set so it kind of gets this interesting

1441
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,880
dilemma so you could actually have both

1442
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:33,050
fields present for like an identifier

1443
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,110
what we've been meaning how to resolve

1444
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:39,830
that but probably a more interesting

1445
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:43,460
issue the number of bits is limited I

1446
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:45,710
think there were 24 and about half of

1447
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:51,730
them are used what happens when we run

1448
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:54,230
out of bits is there is there a plan

1449
01:11:51,730 --> 01:12:08,900
we'll cross that bridge when we come to

1450
01:11:54,230 --> 01:12:12,799
it I think you need to last it to then

1451
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:14,629
going yeah extent right sure but that's

1452
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,180
the bridge that once we come to it I

1453
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:20,840
think it's not only going to put a sign

1454
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:22,400
yeah well I think that we can at least I

1455
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,310
think we need to go and address that

1456
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,599
maybe even in the document yes your

1457
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:28,460
earlier comment so if you can take that

1458
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:33,620
as feedback from the hackathon onto the

1459
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:36,710
list yeah I'll be super helpful okay so

1460
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:38,989
Frank I talked to you about that

1461
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:41,469
today a little bit vector which where

1462
01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:47,739
the bit is presenting the data right

1463
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:47,739
what's your part on making it a bit mask

1464
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:54,409
so the the question on whether we use a

1465
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:56,570
bit vector or a number thing has been

1466
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:58,339
discussed multiple times there is

1467
01:12:56,570 --> 01:13:01,820
benefits and downsides to the whole

1468
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:04,099
thing I think a couple of moons back we

1469
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,409
settled on that people wanted the bit

1470
01:13:04,099 --> 01:13:10,489
vector mainly for the reason that we're

1471
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:12,348
and you see that I think so far we are

1472
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:15,019
struggling to define what what tell has

1473
01:13:12,349 --> 01:13:17,030
with the profiles we are struggling to

1474
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:19,250
understand which combinations are

1475
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:22,429
actually meaningful from real-world

1476
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:26,929
deployments so what I would say is let's

1477
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:29,690
go with the bit vector for now until we

1478
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:32,030
have more operational experience and

1479
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:34,969
then we can revisit that maybe in a

1480
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:37,040
version 2 of Io a.m. and see well those

1481
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:38,989
are the typical combinations that we

1482
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:42,290
need and then we can encode them in a

1483
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:43,848
more compact way right now I don't know

1484
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:45,619
whether anybody would feel like

1485
01:13:43,849 --> 01:13:48,080
especially in the ITF as an

1486
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:49,790
authoritative source to say those are

1487
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:53,059
the combinations that people will need

1488
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:55,340
and those are the ones that they can't

1489
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:58,010
use and I think that's the big problem

1490
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:01,010
right now with choosing which is why a

1491
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:03,590
couple of moons ago we arrived at well

1492
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:06,469
let's stay with a bit field and I don't

1493
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:08,510
really think that revisiting things that

1494
01:14:06,469 --> 01:14:09,980
we've done so far especially on the

1495
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,590
current revision makes too much sense

1496
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:14,330
it's just like extending a runway and

1497
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:16,340
I'm not sure whether we would arrive at

1498
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:18,440
a different conclusion given that we

1499
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,179
have too many operational insights and

1500
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:23,000
very happy that we see more and more

1501
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:26,960
implementations popping up now thanks to

1502
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,699
Justin for instance but yeah well once

1503
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:39,619
we have the insight let's go and revisit

1504
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:41,509
it in the current one well we we

1505
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:45,848
currently go with a bit field I think

1506
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,849
that's the the solution at hana we have

1507
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,480
well or carve out some space that is

1508
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:54,980
left for a number I think we can go and

1509
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,690
think of something hybrid right so there

1510
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:59,269
isn't it's left that we can go and

1511
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:02,710
repurpose for a profile reference for

1512
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:02,710
instance whatever you want to go and use

1513
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:12,860
data types are so very depending on the

1514
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:15,710
customer that creating a common profile

1515
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:19,190
is just next impossible and given that

1516
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:26,300
we have limited its the enumeration of

1517
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:29,629
all the data types yeah well I think we

1518
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:31,610
escaped office Oh peg snapshot but

1519
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:33,230
that's not a great expect escape path

1520
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:36,170
because that's kind of free format for

1521
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:36,559
everybody in our to parse so yeah good

1522
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:41,599
point

1523
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:47,300
so can I three more minutes on flex or

1524
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:48,920
maybe could can we help yeah this is

1525
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,540
important but we're going to lighting

1526
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,510
talk time so if you're in the end of

1527
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:56,659
that sorry

1528
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:59,090
just yeah right with just with regard to

1529
01:15:56,659 --> 01:16:01,460
this document so I think the plan would

1530
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:03,650
be let's go through this feedback we

1531
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:05,659
have from the hackathon and we'll expect

1532
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:07,309
another Rev or at least yep a good

1533
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:09,379
thorough this discussion on you know

1534
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:11,060
will will get another rough pose in when

1535
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:12,560
once we have these things in and then

1536
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:16,520
maybe we can go and initiate something

1537
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,909
on the mailing list let me ask a

1538
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,469
different question so this is the list

1539
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:24,860
of the first and second hackathon that

1540
01:16:21,469 --> 01:16:26,960
we got input from second second yeah um

1541
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:29,119
each one of these we get one or two

1542
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,190
things out of it it's it sounds like

1543
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,079
hopefully I think there is plans for

1544
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:33,769
having another one in Singapore right

1545
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:37,579
yes

1546
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:39,980
do we want if do we want to hold off on

1547
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:41,719
initiating working group last call until

1548
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,759
we can incorporate the outcome of

1549
01:16:41,719 --> 01:16:45,610
Singapore or not like it's a trade off

1550
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,409
rate there's always been yet another

1551
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:49,730
yeah yeah great no but I mean like so

1552
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:51,530
it's some point you're at diminishing

1553
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:53,809
returns do you believe that we're a

1554
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:56,710
diminishing returns yet on the

1555
01:16:53,810 --> 01:17:00,320
improvement that we can make to the

1556
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:02,740
specification through learning things at

1557
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,599
hackathons

1558
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:07,519
hard question right so we got a shitload

1559
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,860
of comments from the last Hecate

1560
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,110
we got three good comments from this

1561
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:16,370
hackathon yes that's what Tom voice why

1562
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:18,080
now okay III can't predict the future

1563
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,340
rate right so I didn't notice that you

1564
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,450
put a slide up that said working your

1565
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,680
close call and a whole bunch people came

1566
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:23,210
up and had comments right like so a

1567
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,010
really good way to get people to say

1568
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:28,640
things is just a threatening a working

1569
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:30,800
group last call um but this discussion

1570
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,970
when this has been has been um sort of

1571
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,080
like long and ongoing enough that we

1572
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:34,100
haven't had to threaten the working

1573
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:40,250
group last call in order to get people

1574
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:44,210
to stand up and say things um he yeah

1575
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:55,010
it's it's Tom do you have something on

1576
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:58,790
this point great I would much prefer

1577
01:17:55,010 --> 01:18:02,290
that we have a couple of router vendors

1578
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:06,110
with confrontation might be difficult

1579
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:08,390
bringing Rachel implementation but to

1580
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:09,830
your point you know it's not just

1581
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,540
hackathon right what is the

1582
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:14,240
implementation experience is there any

1583
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:18,560
deployment experience do we have

1584
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:22,340
validation my comments you know they may

1585
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:25,070
be superficial and it's always the case

1586
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:28,010
well if we say maybe we should rearrange

1587
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:29,840
the field slightly maybe maybe not

1588
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:32,030
depending if somebody's already deployed

1589
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,040
that yeah I've heard some I think the

1590
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,480
comments yeah I've heard some I've heard

1591
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,650
some maybe if you rearrange things but

1592
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,330
I've also heard some feedback that's a

1593
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,650
little bit more a little bit more

1594
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,790
substantial with respect to like sort of

1595
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,860
editorial stuff and things that were

1596
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:45,410
hard to figure out right like so we're

1597
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:46,700
not looking to change the the

1598
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:48,980
implementations as much as we are

1599
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:53,240
looking to improve the specification to

1600
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:54,769
improve the chances that it is easy to

1601
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,719
build an interoperable implementations

1602
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:58,040
only reading this back before we zoom is

1603
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,990
working applause all right like that's

1604
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:10,130
the that's the bargain I'm trying to set

1605
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:11,480
here like so and usually usually the way

1606
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:13,130
that these things sort of work out is

1607
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,929
that the the last call button gets

1608
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:17,930
pushed so that the last call and

1609
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:19,160
at the next meeting if things go very

1610
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:22,010
very quickly then we can do it before

1611
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,960
then but um yeah so it seems like a plan

1612
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:26,630
let's get the Commons on the list and

1613
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:30,440
try to go and get an update on in all

1614
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:35,150
this timeframe so that it's not like dry

1615
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:36,919
again yeah so the other document is the

1616
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:40,670
more active thing that we had in the

1617
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:43,420
last meeting was around flags so the new

1618
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:46,070
draft was really the stuff that was not

1619
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:50,150
really feeling like completely settled

1620
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:55,370
by the group in Prague and so all of

1621
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:57,049
that is in the flags draft now it's

1622
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:59,210
ready to go and split the conversation

1623
01:19:57,050 --> 01:20:00,920
so what is in there it's three flags

1624
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:03,550
it's the loopback flag and the loop flag

1625
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,500
flag existed from the very beginning

1626
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:09,320
it's a flag to go and do what I would

1627
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:14,450
call efficient traceroute it's mentioned

1628
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:16,940
and refer to Inara and else document so

1629
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:19,099
that you can go and compare that to the

1630
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:21,830
classic methods like Paris twice rot or

1631
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,750
even a really classic twice route and

1632
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:26,809
what you can go with do with hybrid

1633
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:29,030
methods just tells you at every single

1634
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:30,950
hop like go and send a copy back to the

1635
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:33,889
originator and the originator has to be

1636
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:35,179
the encapsulation encapsulating notify

1637
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:37,820
um so there's a couple of constrains

1638
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:40,550
around there so not to on go go weld on

1639
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:43,009
that so he can go and detect the power

1640
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:44,990
of a single round trip the second thing

1641
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:46,580
is the immediate export flag and I

1642
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:47,660
mentioned that that there's been active

1643
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:50,500
discussions on the lists on that

1644
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:55,519
particular one around

1645
01:20:50,500 --> 01:21:00,530
well not using that flag but using an IO

1646
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:04,640
am option and borrowing text from the

1647
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:07,219
the PBG draft which is as many things in

1648
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,660
there including how we could go do

1649
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:11,240
things with our um and we have a

1650
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:12,710
dedicated document Oh Matt and then well

1651
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,420
if you have an option you don't need the

1652
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:16,070
flag anymore

1653
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:19,280
and the third one is the active flag

1654
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:21,650
which is a bit of a helper flag I would

1655
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,389
call it it's not active in the sense

1656
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:27,389
like I want you to do something with

1657
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:31,290
this it's active in in the sense of 77

1658
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:33,780
99 where you say well this is traffic

1659
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:36,660
that is used for probing active

1660
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:40,550
measurements so the UDP probe that you

1661
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:44,400
guys have done at the hackathon

1662
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:46,380
including IOM could have put the active

1663
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,030
flag on so that from an operational

1664
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:50,610
perspective that traffic would have been

1665
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:55,410
easier to detect for whatever reason

1666
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:57,269
right so the idea was there and we found

1667
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,250
that out in a particular document in

1668
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:08,100
order to have more debate

1669
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:09,270
so greco should consider the impact of

1670
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:14,670
using a loopback

1671
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:16,430
flag in inter-domain there sorry say

1672
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:21,390
again in which scenarios into the main

1673
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:25,770
you have multiple domains good question

1674
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:30,300
I don't think so because I OEM is a

1675
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:33,950
proto main feature Percy for IOM de Maya

1676
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:39,510
and well multiple io am domains together

1677
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:42,630
mmm not sure so as I said like it's been

1678
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:44,940
built very with a very specific use guys

1679
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:46,890
and Petra brought that to us where he

1680
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:49,919
said well I have my UDP ping er I won't

1681
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:52,500
drop it detection can we do something by

1682
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,060
combining the UDP ping er with IO am and

1683
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,820
well we built that and we both as a

1684
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,980
prototype we socialized that at that's

1685
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:01,200
invited in IETF and then it kind of

1686
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:04,530
entered the draft so that's how it

1687
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:08,490
worked and it's been useful for those

1688
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:09,900
cases we might need to go and mossad and

1689
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:24,300
further in order to make it really

1690
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:28,740
applicable across everybody cents your

1691
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:29,930
company you'd appreciate with Pro we

1692
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:32,429
send it all the way to the destination

1693
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:33,840
we want it to come back all the notes

1694
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:37,380
still about their information and we

1695
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,929
just get one reply packet so I'm

1696
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:41,610
wondering so if I and I

1697
01:23:39,929 --> 01:23:43,610
think it posted about having that neck

1698
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:46,710
conic reflection but for the loop back

1699
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:50,670
is there a real use case for this that's

1700
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:53,219
been identified yeah that's what that

1701
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:55,140
was to work with better raft on on you D

1702
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:56,670
beeping probe or whatever because the

1703
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:59,040
thing is like if you're if you're

1704
01:23:56,670 --> 01:24:01,170
probing doesn't make it to be very end

1705
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,730
so you have probes configured a new data

1706
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:08,070
center all over on all the application

1707
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:10,169
ports and then well you see a probe

1708
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:12,059
breaking what do you do for that

1709
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,190
particular probe that broke you're

1710
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:16,140
attaching iom information to that and

1711
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:18,178
that means if you do that borrow from

1712
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:20,730
both side bidirectionally all of these

1713
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:22,170
probes will travel to the point where

1714
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:24,509
you have the broken device or the broken

1715
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:25,710
link so you can with one round-trip from

1716
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,600
both ends of you correlate that or

1717
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:29,480
information you can relatively rapidly

1718
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,560
figure out where things start went wrong

1719
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:44,099
faster than with classic right route

1720
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:46,699
right that was the use guys designed a

1721
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,080
really nice amplification attack yeah

1722
01:24:46,699 --> 01:24:54,419
yeah you could call it the amplification

1723
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:54,420
[Laughter]

1724
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:11,940
security so we had some discussion about

1725
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:15,980
it obviously it exists so people need to

1726
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:18,330
know about it but it can't be prevented

1727
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:24,089
it's a tool it's a hammer or you can

1728
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:27,929
kill somebody with a hammer implications

1729
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:31,170
the point is that it can be used by

1730
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:33,989
malicious attack so you're creating to

1731
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:38,159
that too easy create the complication

1732
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:41,040
attack it's not that be careful what you

1733
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:43,199
do when you're traveling you're creating

1734
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,070
the to the attackers will laugh because

1735
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:49,530
they will really what your network using

1736
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:51,750
well if you allow the attacker to send

1737
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:54,340
you traffic with IOM yes

1738
01:25:51,750 --> 01:26:07,810
well that's that's probably likely

1739
01:25:54,340 --> 01:26:11,400
traffic from outside your domain we'll

1740
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:24,910
be happy to get any comments about

1741
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:28,150
section yeah we can we can bite said the

1742
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:29,800
names of the flags and how much how many

1743
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:31,210
blinky warnings they should have on them

1744
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:36,430
I like calling it the amplifications

1745
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:46,270
like actually you're the ad you can just

1746
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:48,220
get up and start talking I'm gonna take

1747
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:49,150
that question in a second I mean I'm

1748
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:53,080
gonna handle this one and then I'm gonna

1749
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:55,269
go back to that okay sorry yeah all

1750
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,830
right mmm good

1751
01:26:55,270 --> 01:27:01,210
so adopters working group document uh I

1752
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:02,920
don't really think we need to go through

1753
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:04,930
the whole rigmarole of doing a two-week

1754
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:07,480
call I will make the following statement

1755
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:09,100
uh from the chair

1756
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:11,379
we intend to adopt this as a working

1757
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:16,630
group document we intend to give you an

1758
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:20,620
instruction to send us a ITF zero zero

1759
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:22,480
vision of this in a week or two um and

1760
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:23,590
if anybody hat will make will announce

1761
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,309
that on the list and if anybody has a

1762
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:27,250
problem with it

1763
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:29,380
um and should have a really good reason

1764
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:31,030
why you have a problem with it we will

1765
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:33,490
consider really good reasons where you

1766
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:38,980
might have a problem call this one or

1767
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:40,809
this one without immediate export your

1768
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,669
your your intending to remove immediate

1769
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:45,820
order and put it into the next row of

1770
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:49,000
data right no no I'm intending to well

1771
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:51,429
there's gonna be a new document or an

1772
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,930
immediate export yes so just defines a

1773
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:55,390
particular option so this one whatever

1774
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:56,890
new data data okay okay

1775
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:58,930
so the instruction would be the next

1776
01:27:56,890 --> 01:28:00,910
revision of this document according to

1777
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:04,600
the plan of the authors should be an

1778
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:05,389
IETF IP DM document and if anybody has a

1779
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,179
problem with that

1780
01:28:05,389 --> 01:28:10,729
and you can yell at the chairs and have

1781
01:28:08,179 --> 01:28:12,919
a good reason because like they're doing

1782
01:28:10,729 --> 01:28:15,769
the whole like actually I mean this this

1783
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:17,599
is its its content from organ group

1784
01:28:15,769 --> 01:28:21,550
document correct it's fine

1785
01:28:17,599 --> 01:28:23,689
alright I have a question from the chair

1786
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:28,130
now I have another question from the

1787
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:30,380
chair before that is does it make sense

1788
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:32,749
from a specification readability

1789
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:37,280
standpoint for the content in this

1790
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:39,349
document to be in a separate standards

1791
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,840
track RFC from the rest of the IOM data

1792
01:28:39,349 --> 01:28:44,809
model document like this was separated

1793
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,610
out to make the discussion easier um do

1794
01:28:44,809 --> 01:28:49,219
you want the text back in one doc or do

1795
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:53,209
you want two Doc's that you don't have

1796
01:28:49,219 --> 01:28:56,659
the answer now well I have excellent it

1797
01:28:53,209 --> 01:28:58,159
was in one document great it wasn't one

1798
01:28:56,659 --> 01:29:00,320
document for a reason because that's

1799
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:03,709
easier to do ask why so that people have

1800
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:07,308
to go in here to discuss wait this is

1801
01:29:03,709 --> 01:29:09,709
why it separated out do you want to hold

1802
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:12,679
the publication of the data model to

1803
01:29:09,709 --> 01:29:13,969
pull this back in after everything is as

1804
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:17,090
I said I don't want to go in to hold

1805
01:29:13,969 --> 01:29:21,590
that the publication of the data graph

1806
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:25,669
forever if the model is like we get 0/0

1807
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:27,099
out on the flags and we can go and

1808
01:29:25,669 --> 01:29:29,539
converge on that relatively quickly

1809
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:32,449
maybe we can go and fold it back in

1810
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:34,849
we're in the timeframe that the data

1811
01:29:32,449 --> 01:29:38,268
draft kind of also comes into revision

1812
01:29:34,849 --> 01:29:41,689
oh seven I would be in favor of that as

1813
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:42,979
opposed to having two documents yeah

1814
01:29:41,689 --> 01:29:44,659
because I think if you have everything

1815
01:29:42,979 --> 01:29:46,159
in one place and you dump that on one

1816
01:29:44,659 --> 01:29:47,509
person and you'll do it their way and

1817
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,949
then yes all the references in one

1818
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:51,079
document it's always better than having

1819
01:29:48,949 --> 01:29:54,558
two documents can people also read two

1820
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:56,989
documents as absolutely H so this slight

1821
01:29:54,559 --> 01:30:00,169
preference but a not a big water okay we

1822
01:29:56,989 --> 01:30:01,820
can we can revisit that later now let us

1823
01:30:00,169 --> 01:30:05,570
go back to your list of documents to

1824
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:07,849
verify this is also an ad question are

1825
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:09,710
there any of these for which we do not

1826
01:30:07,849 --> 01:30:12,920
have a plan moving forward

1827
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:12,920
[Music]

1828
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:22,000
then again so beside any security and

1829
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:25,059
application I checked and whatever so

1830
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,820
like I had some general concerns that if

1831
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,200
you use flags to instruct the

1832
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:30,790
intermediate router to do something

1833
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:32,980
specific that's like be going to scope

1834
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:34,540
of what you initially he was intending

1835
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:36,730
to do right so that's like for me it

1836
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:38,050
would be a different protocol so I am

1837
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:39,820
seeing a little bit more discussion

1838
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:40,810
needed yeah there's many reasons to

1839
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,280
separate it out because one of the

1840
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:43,750
outcomes might be as we adopt this as a

1841
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:53,080
working your document is like yeah we

1842
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:58,840
don't like excellent feedback cool let

1843
01:30:53,080 --> 01:31:01,059
me stay out there already is ready for

1844
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,290
working with us Cole I don't think any

1845
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:07,750
interpretation should be published

1846
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:09,790
before the data's published looking at

1847
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:12,190
the speed of what SFC is that right now

1848
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:13,990
yeah I'm not worried well so they won't

1849
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,280
so I mean just as a matter of how

1850
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:17,380
clusters work in the arts the editor

1851
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,580
process they won't be publishes RFC's

1852
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,660
because there's gonna be a normative

1853
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:22,930
reference and we'll go in a Miss Wright

1854
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:24,160
State it will be more difficult for the

1855
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:25,600
is heater reviews is like hey

1856
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:32,080
encapsulate this thing what things we're

1857
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:32,980
not going to tell you yeah that is it

1858
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,130
that is a bit of a risk

1859
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:37,900
exactly are there any documents here

1860
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:39,490
especially in the encapsulation so I

1861
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,900
think everything else is fine are there

1862
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:44,110
any documents your kneecaps elations

1863
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:46,960
that it is not clear from y'all commence

1864
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:49,509
meeting what the next step is yeah yes

1865
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:53,370
even that can be either tight and I

1866
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:53,370
think the outcome of the discussion was

1867
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:57,599
do we want it and if we want it where

1868
01:31:56,830 --> 01:32:07,960
should we take it

1869
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:27,010
so not IP p.m. she gets suresh 280

1870
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:30,430
sponsor sorry somebody actively working

1871
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:33,070
on there yeah okay because the only

1872
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:35,380
concern that I always say Mercedes 400

1873
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:37,179
is that you guess often less review than

1874
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:40,240
other documents which have a home in

1875
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:41,860
working group great so I'm I have to

1876
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,110
look at this during the see like was it

1877
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:46,690
only presented in IPA p.m. or was

1878
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:49,330
discussed in any other work no I think

1879
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:50,830
we discussed that in men vo3 as well so

1880
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:53,200
we've been doing a little bit of a

1881
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:55,960
shopping tour with that and so it

1882
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:57,580
originated from the original grn cap

1883
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:00,130
and that people said you want an either

1884
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:03,370
type if you want an either type please

1885
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:05,170
go to - I totally only ones because it's

1886
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:07,240
very unlikely that he getting more than

1887
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:08,710
one because there's multiple protocols

1888
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,530
that would benefit from one and that

1889
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:15,760
evolved to Brian riding the who's now

1890
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:18,190
retired he has loads of time so so

1891
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,480
that we can you know take off it seems

1892
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:21,160
to me that like just as a nother

1893
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:24,309
discussion venue if there are different

1894
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:25,420
people in a ruminant area that would be

1895
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:28,810
another place where you could get

1896
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:32,400
feedback on this not there like you know

1897
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:32,400
about that int area says yeah please

1898
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:47,230
okay sounds good thank you okay so

1899
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:50,320
that's a plan for everything man

1900
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:55,330
excellent thank you we are now 27

1901
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:59,849
minutes be on time yeah okay yep so

1902
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:59,850
stamp extensions Greg take it away

1903
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:18,070
extensions to simple two-way active

1904
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:22,030
measurement protocol thank you - Rakesh

1905
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:26,170
and Tehran for comments suggestions and

1906
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:31,320
help to improve the document okay so

1907
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:37,420
what extensions we take

1908
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:41,320
what we refer as base stamp packet

1909
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:43,720
format for the sender it's well known

1910
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:47,380
sequence number time stamp and 30

1911
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:51,340
updates of betting to make it

1912
01:34:47,380 --> 01:35:00,670
symmetrical and then we append TVs until

1913
01:34:51,340 --> 01:35:02,500
these can be enclosed some extensions we

1914
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:06,190
consider the mandatory optional

1915
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:10,660
experimental and vendor private use so

1916
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:20,169
that to create appropriate I am a

1917
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:23,280
registry extra padding TV to be able to

1918
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:25,840
create packets of different size

1919
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:28,150
vocation TV it was a very good

1920
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:32,230
discussion so location till the idea is

1921
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:36,940
that reflector copies from the received

1922
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:39,269
packet the source MAC address source IP

1923
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:42,669
address and destination IP address

1924
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:45,100
destination port or source port and send

1925
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:50,070
it back to the sender so the sender can

1926
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:56,020
monitor what is it an ultimate router

1927
01:35:50,070 --> 01:36:00,130
for their reflector and that we get the

1928
01:35:56,020 --> 01:36:04,150
contribution from Hendrick a Syrian from

1929
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:06,820
their experience in using teal and white

1930
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:10,360
in the field so they find that it's a

1931
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:14,820
very useful feature again it's not a

1932
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:19,360
testing it's a monitoring time stamp TV

1933
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:22,450
well because of the way high time stamp

1934
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:25,480
is obtained and what synchronization is

1935
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:27,519
used it effects clearly the accuracy of

1936
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:30,099
the time stamp and understanding the

1937
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:33,100
accuracy of the time stamp we believe

1938
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:37,030
it's useful so there is a time stamp for

1939
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:40,330
that till you for that course of service

1940
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:46,990
still V based primarily for the

1941
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:50,320
case of backhaul wireless backhaul when

1942
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:53,710
the provider operator has multiple

1943
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:57,190
services on the same path then the

1944
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:59,070
services are differentiated they use a

1945
01:36:57,190 --> 01:37:01,509
different class of service and

1946
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:05,799
traversing different domains sometimes

1947
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:08,130
are these services this markings cost of

1948
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:13,690
service Marcos has to be remapped and

1949
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:18,000
because it's a very manual labor

1950
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:22,269
sometimes humans do make errors and

1951
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:25,770
their behavior that it exhibits itself

1952
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:28,300
dem asserts itself is that how services

1953
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:33,600
packets get dropped while there are

1954
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:41,010
whole service of example 3G keeps going

1955
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:45,730
so the idea of this is that sender can

1956
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:51,280
request the reflector to return back DCP

1957
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:56,379
marking and is what received more so it

1958
01:37:51,280 --> 01:38:00,880
can instruct reflector to use the

1959
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:04,180
specified DHCP value for the reflected

1960
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:09,370
packet so in this way in a very short

1961
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:12,460
sequence of test packets operator can

1962
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:15,570
verify how their mapping in the network

1963
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:21,820
if it works properly of their reserves

1964
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:24,929
miss configuration direct measurement TV

1965
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:28,330
so it's a pretty simple there a

1966
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:30,520
mechanism of stamp is to do synthetic

1967
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:34,180
Ross measurement but there is an

1968
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:37,350
interest in doing sometimes direct

1969
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:42,000
measurement or basically collecting the

1970
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:45,840
counters of their certain flow of the

1971
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:49,090
packets that are in profile of the flow

1972
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,110
definition of it in profile is up to

1973
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:53,600
their operator

1974
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:59,509
this is a pretty standard it's well

1975
01:38:53,600 --> 01:39:03,680
known from 1731 or 63 74 so the next

1976
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:05,540
step we have some outstanding changes

1977
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:08,570
that we want to make based on our

1978
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:17,019
discussion with Rakesh the question was

1979
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:24,910
that to change the naming of this field

1980
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:28,520
either to ITU terminology 1731 or 263 74

1981
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:31,250
so that would be good to have input from

1982
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:35,990
the working group but it's more

1983
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:39,650
editorial and as you know we're you know

1984
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:42,080
are we still in production all or we

1985
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:46,160
already closed adoption form it is is

1986
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:48,590
adopting its adopted take okay so I

1987
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:56,800
appreciate all your feedback support

1988
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:56,800
that helped us to go over this hump yes

1989
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:10,910
couple of comments one is about this

1990
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:13,340
direct loss measurement here we and if

1991
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:15,380
we make it hard where if you can make it

1992
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:18,830
the first year we like that that VM

1993
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:22,430
message then its location is known and

1994
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:26,170
we know where the offset is easy yes

1995
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:29,990
yeah thank you for this comment because

1996
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:33,050
what we intend to do further is to

1997
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:36,200
really go over each Tod and be more

1998
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:47,390
conservative and strict about how this

1999
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:51,280
should be utilized in 27 busy plus there

2000
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:55,250
is a byte offset so I the issue was that

2001
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:57,860
if responder its stamp and query years

2002
01:40:55,250 --> 01:41:00,110
of course this year we extensive

2003
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:03,740
respondent doesn't and you get a message

2004
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:04,480
I the way I understood the respondent

2005
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:07,630
make it

2006
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:10,360
it might think that 28 and 29 5 is

2007
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:12,880
supposed to tell you the size of the

2008
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:15,370
padding afterwards and in this case is

2009
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,980
zero zero but that it is there is one

2010
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:20,170
more bite so then it may not be able to

2011
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:25,570
process it so I shared that comment on

2012
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:38,590
the list okay so a new seller the sender

2013
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:40,509
is t1 or sender is stamp right but in in

2014
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:46,780
this case the responder just will

2015
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:50,200
respond because their server octet are 0

2016
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:52,870
so he can respond might be with a

2017
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:56,950
symmetric packet but basically would not

2018
01:41:52,870 --> 01:42:10,000
try to parse TVs because he will look at

2019
01:41:56,950 --> 01:42:12,940
them as a pairing well okay I need to

2020
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,340
read yes so your question maybe I need

2021
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:19,089
to read if I have a question I'll go to

2022
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:23,200
follow up but the idea was that why we

2023
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:26,620
made this field must be zeroed so that

2024
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:29,050
it indicates that you you have you don't

2025
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:44,740
have a server art facility you must copy

2026
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:47,860
it because things that but it's actually

2027
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:53,200
one so that is ok so I always notice

2028
01:42:47,860 --> 01:43:00,059
thank you for the comments all right

2029
01:42:53,200 --> 01:43:00,059
thank you very much next up yes my gosh

2030
01:43:08,389 --> 01:43:12,899
good afternoon everyone my name is

2031
01:43:10,889 --> 01:43:18,179
Mukesh Gandhi and I'm presenting the

2032
01:43:12,899 --> 01:43:22,139
draft on Sal p.m. using tea ramp on

2033
01:43:18,179 --> 01:43:23,639
behalf of the authors listed so agenda

2034
01:43:22,139 --> 01:43:26,820
is basically to have a look at

2035
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:29,219
requirements and scope the probe query

2036
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:33,058
and response messages there is a need

2037
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:35,429
for a CMP and next steps so the

2038
01:43:33,059 --> 01:43:37,349
requirement is to for the delay in last

2039
01:43:35,429 --> 01:43:41,789
measurement for segment routing for

2040
01:43:37,349 --> 01:43:46,260
links and into end SR policies for both

2041
01:43:41,789 --> 01:43:49,709
SR MPLS NS a v6 data pins we're not

2042
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:52,919
using the control channel signaling so

2043
01:43:49,709 --> 01:43:55,050
eliminate signaling as well as state 4

2044
01:43:52,919 --> 01:43:58,709
on the egress node that's the spirit of

2045
01:43:55,050 --> 01:44:01,439
SR there is requirement for a CMP as

2046
01:43:58,709 --> 01:44:04,139
well as a support for direct mode loss

2047
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:09,300
measurement the scope is using the t

2048
01:44:04,139 --> 01:44:12,209
vamp and user configure the UDP ports

2049
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:17,339
and both authenticated and

2050
01:44:12,209 --> 01:44:20,099
unauthenticated modes so probe query

2051
01:44:17,339 --> 01:44:22,530
messages are basically the message is

2052
01:44:20,099 --> 01:44:26,269
defined in the 5350 say I want the TR

2053
01:44:22,530 --> 01:44:28,909
messages for delay there is a UDP port

2054
01:44:26,269 --> 01:44:31,619
being is configured for the

2055
01:44:28,909 --> 01:44:33,570
unauthenticated north and saying where

2056
01:44:31,619 --> 01:44:35,598
there is another port for authenticated

2057
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:40,169
more so this is to make the hardware

2058
01:44:35,599 --> 01:44:43,729
implementation easier so there is a new

2059
01:44:40,169 --> 01:44:47,550
alum message format define it's a fixed

2060
01:44:43,729 --> 01:44:50,839
message very similar to the DM message

2061
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:53,879
has fixed offsets for the counters and

2062
01:44:50,839 --> 01:44:57,469
another UDP port is configured to

2063
01:44:53,879 --> 01:45:04,139
indicate that this is an alum message

2064
01:44:57,469 --> 01:45:06,749
for SL v6 there is a solid header with n

2065
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:10,589
function OTP for the delay measurement

2066
01:45:06,749 --> 01:45:14,179
OB for LM for SR MPLS there is a label

2067
01:45:10,589 --> 01:45:16,519
stack for response

2068
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:17,660
so this if you depending on if you're

2069
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,840
doing one way measurement to a

2070
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:23,540
measurement although quick measurements

2071
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:26,450
responses sent bit differently for

2072
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:30,519
two-way the drop defines written party

2073
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:37,040
LV using the mechanisms that Greg is

2074
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:40,330
extending for EC mp4s our policy for

2075
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:44,000
ipv4 ipv6 one twenty seven eight

2076
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:48,200
destination addresses being swept for SR

2077
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:52,300
MPLS its entropy label or SL v6 there is

2078
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,300
a flow label in SRS that we can use

2079
01:45:53,410 --> 01:46:00,410
definitely stamp message format can be

2080
01:45:57,110 --> 01:46:03,500
used it's very similar to t1 there is

2081
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:06,550
different padding size embassy size but

2082
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:09,410
that can be user configure and

2083
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:11,690
definitely the the TL we are also

2084
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:13,970
applicable as a matter of fact we are

2085
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:18,379
defining written party LV for to a

2086
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:20,090
measurement so we welcome your comments

2087
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:24,050
and suggestions we do have

2088
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:25,730
implementations for this and we are

2089
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:34,070
requesting a spring working group

2090
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:39,049
adoption for this one is this in

2091
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:42,170
parallel with the RFC 67 34.9 for

2092
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:46,130
Springer's is replace that yeah so we

2093
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:51,020
have prioritized t1 over the 60 to 70

2094
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:56,960
for although both concepts are similar

2095
01:46:51,020 --> 01:47:01,660
you will use UDP port to 1000 for the 66

2096
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:04,910
94 and 11000 for TM but there is more

2097
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:12,050
interest from customers 40 than 60

2098
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:14,000
systolic or signaling the caiman 62

2099
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:16,820
standing for say whether whether or not

2100
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,860
you wanted unidirectional or

2101
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:20,889
bi-directional because it looks like

2102
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:24,110
some of the TVs in here look like

2103
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:25,849
7876 RC something the uro type stuff for

2104
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:31,018
the

2105
01:47:25,849 --> 01:47:34,619
so for 6670 for the return path is 7876

2106
01:47:31,019 --> 01:47:37,859
for Fatima is basically the same t1

2107
01:47:34,619 --> 01:47:40,459
match so query will be over and the

2108
01:47:37,859 --> 01:47:54,449
response could be t1 so we're not using

2109
01:47:40,459 --> 01:47:56,639
7876 for this t1 vs IBM so that's the

2110
01:47:54,449 --> 01:47:59,848
extension we are adding that if it's a

2111
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:03,989
two-way measurement then we are defining

2112
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:07,169
a TLV return path TLV so that we expect

2113
01:48:03,989 --> 01:48:14,699
the responder to send the response back

2114
01:48:07,169 --> 01:48:18,269
on this path so is it a request for

2115
01:48:14,699 --> 01:48:20,638
adoption in spring that happened this no

2116
01:48:18,269 --> 01:48:23,939
so we couldn't get slot for this in

2117
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:26,849
swing this time so we'll okay I mean you

2118
01:48:23,939 --> 01:48:28,139
can also ask them to an adoption call by

2119
01:48:26,849 --> 01:48:30,269
email if you want to do it between now

2120
01:48:28,139 --> 01:48:33,209
and Singapore right yes is the one thing

2121
01:48:30,269 --> 01:48:34,709
that I would ask as chair is that you

2122
01:48:33,209 --> 01:48:36,659
keep us up to date at least on the

2123
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:39,959
mailing list as as that progresses

2124
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:41,848
through and as that goes to working

2125
01:48:39,959 --> 01:48:43,079
across call and spring we should also do

2126
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:44,399
a work in your process call here to make

2127
01:48:43,079 --> 01:48:47,459
sure that no the changes that happen in

2128
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:48,749
spring would make it not work well I

2129
01:48:47,459 --> 01:48:51,419
would I can't even imagine what that

2130
01:48:48,749 --> 01:48:53,398
would be but um just given given how

2131
01:48:51,419 --> 01:48:55,229
this works and how the integration seems

2132
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:59,309
pretty clean but we want to make sure

2133
01:48:55,229 --> 01:49:00,479
that people had a chance to have a last

2134
01:48:59,309 --> 01:49:02,039
look at it before it goes through and

2135
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:03,869
working group last call so yeah

2136
01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:06,090
otherwise excellent you wish you luck

2137
01:49:03,869 --> 01:49:08,070
yeah thank you for this luck and thanks

2138
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:22,139
for coming over to give us a heads up on

2139
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:25,219
this so postcard base telemetry turn

2140
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:29,999
from Malawi I would like to introduce

2141
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:32,699
poster carpenter Elementary we discussed

2142
01:49:29,999 --> 01:49:36,209
a lot in this working group about the

2143
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:38,339
passport baster telemetry that is the

2144
01:49:36,209 --> 01:49:42,050
IOM the existing high

2145
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:45,510
and here this this drafter is going to

2146
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:48,500
describe the postcard based eternity we

2147
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:51,980
described a lot about the trade-offs

2148
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:55,230
including the performance impact the

2149
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:58,019
encapsulation and overhead and security

2150
01:49:55,230 --> 01:50:01,709
and the configuration correlation and

2151
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:04,940
Java location indication we also

2152
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:07,380
describe the postcards determine

2153
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:10,769
solutions and the implementation

2154
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:15,420
considerations basically we introduced

2155
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:18,980
the to PvP mode why is called the PBM

2156
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:22,470
that means we will configure the

2157
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:25,740
telemetry data in each node and we will

2158
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:30,390
use a marking bits in use a packet to

2159
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:33,150
trigger the postcard the Daedric spot

2160
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:36,020
and this is a fried onion and the

2161
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:40,170
implemented in this in the enhanced

2162
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:43,260
eliminate marking draft and Joseph well

2163
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:47,100
later describe this and the other mode

2164
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:50,580
is the called PBT I in this mode we will

2165
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:53,790
insert instruction into the user packet

2166
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:56,010
and every node will read the instruction

2167
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:59,940
and the captured data and ship out data

2168
01:50:56,010 --> 01:51:02,550
directory to the collector and I want me

2169
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:08,700
as now discussing on how to apply this

2170
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:12,960
mode um here we propose a PPT I said I

2171
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:15,900
one often will we discuss on upgrading

2172
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:20,820
in the side making a mental list to

2173
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:24,719
define a PPT is a harm option and we

2174
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:27,500
close this discussion on floor ID and

2175
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:31,440
sequence number by make them optional

2176
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:34,260
optional and we also agreed on the

2177
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:38,250
foreign option header as the starting

2178
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:41,690
point and we also do the hack song and

2179
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:48,590
two three implements this option in

2180
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:49,669
physical devices here's an extended

2181
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:53,420
discussion

2182
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:57,290
actions to indicate how to use them the

2183
01:51:53,420 --> 01:52:00,020
data this is also from a suggestion this

2184
01:51:57,290 --> 01:52:03,440
is also a suggestion from many lists and

2185
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:07,460
we here's the initial proposal we

2186
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:11,719
propose to allocate five bit from the

2187
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:15,440
flag for actions and we propose this

2188
01:52:11,719 --> 01:52:19,880
four bits right now which are motivated

2189
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:28,389
from from IFA and our own panic as draft

2190
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:34,610
and here there's other related action

2191
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:38,179
described in the hi peewee 600 a.m.

2192
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:41,719
until we draft like the sender telemetry

2193
01:52:38,179 --> 01:52:43,940
packet and the sender ICMP I think it

2194
01:52:41,719 --> 01:52:48,260
should in this architecture it should

2195
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:54,769
not be an action but it could be a new

2196
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:58,070
data type an extra step we will spin out

2197
01:52:54,770 --> 01:53:02,410
the new I option as a dedicated draft

2198
01:52:58,070 --> 01:53:05,299
and this draft I think we have were

2199
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:19,639
discussed and we asked for the working

2200
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:24,500
group adoption sorry documentation for

2201
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:28,070
the action action I I don't think so

2202
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:34,100
because right now the PBT I only can

2203
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:36,620
contains a fixed fixed lens had fuel so

2204
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:45,110
I'm not sure you fruit there's me the

2205
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:53,570
fourth recommendation the flags are

2206
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:56,089
coming from we right now we think we

2207
01:53:53,570 --> 01:54:02,380
well first three in this chapter we

2208
01:53:56,090 --> 01:54:02,380
reuse the flags described in I want aft

2209
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:23,150
define some new flats yeah we can

2210
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:30,980
consider yes sorry I thought you had a

2211
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:33,950
question um sorry um yeah yes so let's

2212
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:37,219
see how long this question takes yeah so

2213
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:40,309
just with regards to moving forward with

2214
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:42,320
this earlier we were mentioning that

2215
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:46,120
some of the content that's currently in

2216
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:48,740
flags we were going to be taking out and

2217
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:50,390
it's actually we've come to a

2218
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:55,700
acknowledgement that we're gonna do some

2219
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:57,050
postcard approach check thing so I got

2220
01:54:55,700 --> 01:55:01,160
the impression earlier that we're going

2221
01:54:57,050 --> 01:55:04,010
to have a new draft for doing that is

2222
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:06,800
that something that this draft will be

2223
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:10,940
merged with what what is the what is the

2224
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:13,550
end goal for our postcard end Flags

2225
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:22,839
story here maybe Frank you want to

2226
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:26,630
comment in turn what we need is a

2227
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:29,960
definition of the new I um option that

2228
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:32,180
describes immediate explore right right

2229
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:34,430
and I think where we can go and borrow

2230
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:37,550
some of especially like the people I

2231
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:42,170
think two slides back that data format

2232
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:49,760
will borrow that and with the existing

2233
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:52,070
tax coming needed explore what I see

2234
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:55,790
from this documents perspective I think

2235
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:58,639
it was mostly like a wigwam scattering

2236
01:55:55,790 --> 01:56:01,250
exercise because it loaned from other

2237
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:07,190
documents or other protocols that are

2238
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:09,130
not even ICAO flying and so well I think

2239
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:14,660
it's it's done its job

2240
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:15,230
yep all right I'm coming to answer your

2241
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:18,170
question

2242
01:56:15,230 --> 01:56:20,000
I believe your comments before should

2243
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:22,700
apply to that as well like if we took

2244
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,420
the flux out of the data yep while we

2245
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:30,290
eventually especially before would like

2246
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:33,380
to have one Shirley yes English it would

2247
01:56:30,290 --> 01:56:37,160
pass as well take it how the document is

2248
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:38,810
a flags yes yes as far as how we end up

2249
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:42,260
publishing things that's fine sir

2250
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:44,090
so well what I would like to see is what

2251
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:47,270
we go forward for what we want to adopt

2252
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:50,560
as work is one document on this approach

2253
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:54,140
and ideally get the authors from both

2254
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:57,640
working together on that document so I

2255
01:56:54,140 --> 01:57:02,570
guess are you guys okay with doing that

2256
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:06,350
sure I at another understand maybe my

2257
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:11,000
intention is to firstly adopt this

2258
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:15,500
approach document this this document and

2259
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:18,560
also we will spin out the I wan option

2260
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:23,530
part and this spin out this and the way

2261
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:24,980
we're walkways Frank and other people

2262
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:28,580
walk home

2263
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:30,589
that's new okay so I guess it's a little

2264
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:33,620
unclear to me why we would necessarily

2265
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:35,000
need a separate approach document that's

2266
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:36,830
different from the instance of how we're

2267
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:42,260
going to be using that approach no I am

2268
01:57:36,830 --> 01:57:44,870
I see no way this approach you use is to

2269
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:48,200
describe the postcard is a territory and

2270
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:50,480
we described her a lot including the the

2271
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:54,700
trade-offs are different the most and

2272
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:59,589
also its include PBT PBT and moment

2273
01:57:54,700 --> 01:58:03,349
which will be used to buy other jobs

2274
01:57:59,590 --> 01:58:06,500
right yeah I think ideally we would want

2275
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:09,230
to see that text because folded into the

2276
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:11,660
thing that we're discussing as the PTI

2277
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:13,129
draft and if we eventually need to fold

2278
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:15,220
the other one in as well that'd be great

2279
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:18,110
but I think we do want to see

2280
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:20,570
collaboration here and a single draft as

2281
01:58:18,110 --> 01:58:22,160
a guide especially when we're you know

2282
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:23,929
looking at the process of how we do

2283
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:25,250
working group documents like there's

2284
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:27,410
some overhead for that so having like a

2285
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:28,579
consolidated way to focus on this

2286
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:30,709
together not having like

2287
01:58:28,579 --> 01:58:34,518
a document for the theory of it and the

2288
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:37,699
implementation would be great so I think

2289
01:58:34,519 --> 01:58:42,039
you're suggesting is to see how we split

2290
01:58:37,699 --> 01:58:46,188
for system in this chapter and how to

2291
01:58:42,039 --> 01:58:48,648
well essentially you know the authors of

2292
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:52,089
this document and the authors of the

2293
01:58:48,649 --> 01:58:54,889
flags and the IOM work essentially like

2294
01:58:52,089 --> 01:58:57,530
work together on what will be proposed

2295
01:58:54,889 --> 01:59:00,439
as a working group document to cover

2296
01:58:57,530 --> 01:59:02,179
this together you know I think to get to

2297
01:59:00,439 --> 01:59:04,789
Cameron's question I think there is an

2298
01:59:02,179 --> 01:59:07,909
aspect that applies still IP p.m. and

2299
01:59:04,789 --> 01:59:09,648
that's the only a mess back there might

2300
01:59:07,909 --> 01:59:13,239
be a broader thing on how you want to go

2301
01:59:09,649 --> 01:59:17,139
and do the provisioning piece and

2302
01:59:13,239 --> 01:59:19,459
texture of the packets for export and

2303
01:59:17,139 --> 01:59:23,119
also the requirements discussion that

2304
01:59:19,459 --> 01:59:25,760
you have because that's all come with

2305
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:26,898
related to int as opposed to what we're

2306
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,550
doing here

2307
01:59:26,899 --> 01:59:30,199
that might even go somewhere else right

2308
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:32,599
right don't need to know about that one

2309
01:59:30,199 --> 01:59:38,239
but I'm pretty sure that we need one for

2310
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:41,059
life necessary I think in my point is

2311
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:43,459
the or our point from the chair it's

2312
01:59:41,059 --> 01:59:47,269
very hot Mike is that the document that

2313
01:59:43,459 --> 01:59:50,989
we pull the document that we pull for IO

2314
01:59:47,269 --> 01:59:53,359
am for IP p.m. to if we make the

2315
01:59:50,989 --> 01:59:56,178
adoption call on should talk about the

2316
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,189
data model um should talk about the

2317
01:59:56,179 --> 02:00:00,199
mechanisms driving the data model and

2318
01:59:58,189 --> 02:00:01,760
talk about the mechanisms for deriving

2319
02:00:00,199 --> 02:00:03,768
measurement information from the data

2320
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,539
model so there should be a single

2321
02:00:03,769 --> 02:00:07,039
document that takes some of the stuff

2322
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:09,099
from the flag stuff that's coming out of

2323
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:11,449
the current one and from this document

2324
02:00:09,099 --> 02:00:14,269
we don't care who the authors are but we

2325
02:00:11,449 --> 02:00:17,030
would like to see collaboration um that

2326
02:00:14,269 --> 02:00:19,789
would be proposed like do is you're a

2327
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:21,228
new 0-0 individual and then propose that

2328
02:00:19,789 --> 02:00:22,579
for adoption as opposed to propose and

2329
02:00:21,229 --> 02:00:24,139
this ralphing the other from government

2330
02:00:22,579 --> 02:00:29,030
and we'll mix them up later cos it's

2331
02:00:24,139 --> 02:00:31,369
just kind of messy okay thank you much i

2332
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:36,669
we are now out of time I apologize to

2333
02:00:31,369 --> 02:00:36,669
all of the lightning talk people

2334
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:41,799
come see us in Singapore as a note to

2335
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:43,780
the chairs for the minutes the next time

2336
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:46,390
that um Frank Casas for 20 minutes for

2337
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:49,000
IOM we will not believe him

2338
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:50,290
that was our oversight but I think we

2339
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,860
had excellent discussion today we got

2340
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:55,269
through a lot of stuff if you didn't

2341
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:57,549
have all the wonderful input for no

2342
02:00:55,270 --> 02:01:00,160
working group yeah excellent

2343
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:01,270
and to those if you have stuff that you

2344
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,910
wanted to share your light and talk

2345
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:06,850

2356
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:42,960
doing it forward it'll happen here

2357
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:47,910
because it does it time
