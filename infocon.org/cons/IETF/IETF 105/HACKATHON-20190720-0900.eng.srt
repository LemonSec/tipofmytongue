00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:12,600
okay so some of you can hear me alright

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,250
great we're gonna get started and just

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,869
I wanted to make sure the mic works

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,550
before we did that so but it looks like

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,460
everyone's quiet now so maybe we'll get

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,150
started now that's the most challenging

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,580
part of the hackathon so okay well

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,830

so with that actually I'd like to bring

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:29,549

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:31,979

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,380

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,479
we have more than 330 people registered

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,770

38
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:59,669

39
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,559
commingled so if you're new and you need

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,909
some advice you can just turn the turn

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,920
to the side and find someone who's been

42
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,659
to lots of hackathons or if you have

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,899
questions you can of course come ask

44
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,130
Charles or myself or others who will be

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,000
floating around at the front of the room

46
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,880
here we have a couple of new additions

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,640
for this hackathon in particular first I

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,859
want to say a big thank you to I can

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,809
who's sponsoring this hackathon and has

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,340
committed to sponsoring the next three

51
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,800
so thank you very

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:34,050
much I can I know that in the in the

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,489
run-up to this on Twitter some people

54
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,129
were under the impression that there is

55
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,940
quote free food all day long at the hack

56
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:44,579
upon it's not actually all day long our

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,170
secretariat staff had a bit of a heart

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,459
attack when they heard that that people

59
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,958
thought there was free food all day long

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,790
but there is a lot of food that is

61
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,769
provided here and and other great

62
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,319
services so if and we can't really do

63
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,410
that without a corporate support so if

64
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,359
your company your employer is interested

65
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,090
in potentially sponsoring the hackathon

66
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,130
please come see charles or myself and

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,790
we'd be more than happy to talk to you

68
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,980
about that we also have a new supporter

69
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,629
providing some software licenses at this

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,459
hackathon nova flow I think the Nova

71
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,519
flow people are back there yes Thank You

72
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,799
Nova flow

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,110
[Applause]

74
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,730
helping get some some projects off the

75
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,150
ground so we really appreciate that and

76
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,488
then lastly I think some people may be

77
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,129
familiar with the women's community at

78
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,510
the IETF the ITF sisters to make it a

79
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,608
little bit easier for the sisters to

80
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,760
meet each other as early as the

81
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:38,250
hackathon weekend we've denoted a table

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,230
in the very far back corner during lunch

83
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,569
if the ITF sisters want to gather over

84
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,840
there you can find each other network a

85
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:48,149
little bit over lunch and I think that's

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,069
all we have new this time so I will get

87
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:58,440
out of the way and turn it back to

88
00:03:50,069 --> 00:04:03,690
Charles thanks ok well thank you for

89
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,639
that and so Alissa already asked how

90
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,349
many of you it's your first IHF

91
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,569
hackathon I'm just wondering for how

92
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,250
many of you this is your first time

93
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,750
you've ever like been at anything the

94
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,880
IETF does that's a good number two okay

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,500
well great I think you picked a good

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,389
start hopefully this will be a fantastic

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,479
introduction that makes you want to do

98
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:27,870
more and more with the IETF so so

99
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,940
welcome and will be even what would be

100
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,979
certain to give even extra help and

101
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,380
guidance to you but this is a great way

102
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:38,880
to start I'm going to skip through these

103
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,439
other ones so you know the goal of all

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,659
these hackathons

105
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,520
is really we want to advance the peace

106
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,210
and work that we're doing in the ietf

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,159
anyways

108
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,729
the work we've done around all you know

109
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:53,009
defining standards and if we come here

110
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,990
and we write code at the same time we

111
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,789
test things out right we see if what

112
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,110
we're standardizing works that's a great

113
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,300
way to really improve not only the

114
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,219
quality but to get it done more quickly

115
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,650
so so that's the goal with all these

116
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:07,710
projects in one way shape form or

117
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,739
another but also it's very important

118
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:14,159
that we help new people come into the

119
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,960
hackathon so any of you who are leading

120
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:18,300
projects we have a couple that I've had

121
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,000
identified themselves as being projects

122
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,069
that are particularly good and welcoming

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,229
to newcomers just due to the nature of

124
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,699
those projects yeah you can look for

125
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,680
those on the wiki there's a little star

126
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,860
next to them once in the corner over

127
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,400
here for measurements and then there's

128
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,009
one with with yang and now the goal is

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,120
that you have some background already

130
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,770
that's going to help you with the

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,500
project but they'll help you know help

132
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,710
you find interesting and ways for you to

133
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,969
contribute to those projects so and you

134
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,409
know but that should be true for just

135
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,270
about any project here and again if you

136
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:56,270
have a hard time finding a project come

137
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:58,830
see me I'll help you out the note well

138
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,930
for those of you if it's your first IETF

139
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,270
you might want to take extra time to

140
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,729
read this but everything we do in ITF

141
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,440
falls under the note well and that's

142
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,330
true for the the conversations

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,360
presentations things we do here as well

144
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,520
now the the code that you're working on

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,440
you should take a look at that you know

146
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,639
there's generally some kind of license

147
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,979
associated with that hopefully an

148
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,289
open-source license that's separate from

149
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,289
the note well the code you work on it's

150
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,849
not an IETF contribution necessarily

151
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,469
it's just you have to look at the

152
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,979
license that's associated with that code

153
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:35,490
and and if you need help with that too

154
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:38,128
I'm happy to talk with you about it the

155
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,819
agenda so we started pretty much on time

156
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:43,740
this is being done on meet echo there's

157
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,020
a meet echo session that's only going to

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,270
be for this kickoff part and then we'll

159
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,318
have it again at the end when we do the

160
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,490
presentations we will have lunch being

161
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,449
brought in that's at 12:00

162
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,220
thirty and there's there some dinner

163
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,270
will come in two at about seven o'clock

164
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,780
so it'd be great if you have time and

165
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,280
are able to stick around and and and

166
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,258
have dinner with us and continue to work

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,669
on your projects but really you know

168
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,620
manage your own time if you need to go

169
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,599
to a meeting or something or if you just

170
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,590
want to have a dinner with friends we

171
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,030
understand that too

172
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,159
but know that we're bringing the food in

173
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,219
to make it as easy as possible for you

174
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,319
to continue to work on your projects and

175
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,419
then at ten o'clock we'll close the

176
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,120
doors we should be able to lock this

177
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,770
room I wouldn't leave any personal

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,449
valuables along but if you brought some

179
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,539
equipment that's hard for you to lug

180
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,190
around and set up you should be able to

181
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,289
leave it here you know we're gonna leave

182
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,360
the obviously the APS the switches all

183
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:47,639
that stays in here so it should be a

184
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,860
fairly secure room then it'll reopen

185
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,659
again at about 8:30 maybe a little bit

186
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,250
earlier tomorrow so you can get in here

187
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:57,870
and again lunch will be provided now one

188
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,520
thing I want to let you know about is

189
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,370
although the hackathon doesn't actually

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,919
end until four o'clock around two

191
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,900
o'clock we ask that people kind of wrap

192
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,190
up what you're doing and set it aside so

193
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,099
that we can have some short

194
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,139
presentations about what you you

195
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,430
achieved right what are the results what

196
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,340
things did you learn what are you going

197
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,039
to bring back into your working group so

198
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,609
the thought is at about two o'clock we

199
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,199
we break to do that and think I have

200
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,940
some other slides where are going to

201
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,159
that in more detail that will be

202
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:35,250
broadcasted on on meet echo and recorded

203
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,828
yeah so those presentations they are

204
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,599
meant to be very short think about that

205
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:41,760
we will probably have 30 or more

206
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,279
presentations and we want to get through

207
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,470
them all so we're talking 2-3 minutes at

208
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,510
the most just some highlights so people

209
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,420
understand the space you are working in

210
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,770
and what you learned and kind of give

211
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,110
them that reason to come talk to you

212
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,459
more right and learn more it's just a

213
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:03,270
great way to share information across

214
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:07,319
groups here at the IETF so we do have an

215
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:12,180
IETF hackathon github organization

216
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,240
and within that there is a repo for IT

217
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:19,199
f-105 project presentations and in order

218
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,060
to make it easy for us all to to to you

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
know to show those presentations and to

220
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,859
share them and to have them afterwards I

221
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,160
ask that you basically put your

222
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,140
presentation in this repo in order to do

223
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,550
that you're going to need to be a member

224
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,230
of the IETF hackathon a github org

225
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,880
that's very easy to do just just you can

226
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,650
send me an email and I'll add you to

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,680
that but if you're going to be the

228
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,420
person uploading the presentation please

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,790
make sure that you do that as soon as

230
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,160
possible because on Sunday things get a

231
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,110
little crazy and I may not have access

232
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
to my laptop and may have a hard time

233
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,550
adding you so if you're not a member

234
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,870
already and you think you're going to be

235
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,819
the one responsible for getting your

236
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,620
project up there there's some

237
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,240
instructions about exactly how to go

238
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,730
about doing that it's basically email me

239
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,230
though and it's pretty straightforward

240
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,960
and then you should be able to upload

241
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,580
your presentation there and if you have

242
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,320
any questions just come see me I'll help

243
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,530
you out it's pretty easy so after the

244
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,030
hackathon ends we still have some other

245
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,250
opportunities for getting together to

246
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,280
work on code and to share code the one

247
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,720
thing is this hack demo happy hour and

248
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,890
this is you know you only had those two

249
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,140
to three minutes to share your

250
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,640
presentation but now if you want to have

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,410
it's actually like an hour and a half

252
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,300
right where you can demo what you did

253
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,430
have others who aren't here at the

254
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,199
hackathon come and see what you did and

255
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,729
talk with them about it this is the

256
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,480
opportunity to have those in-depth

257
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:49,650
conversations so it's Monday evening it

258
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:53,160
starts it at 6:10 ends at what's it say

259
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,680
7:40 so it overlaps a little bit with

260
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,180
some of the IETF meetings but it extends

261
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,550
beyond the end of the last meeting I

262
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,170
believe so hopefully that provides a you

263
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,180
know a good convenient time for everyone

264
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,979
to get together it's not in this room

265
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,800
often times it is in the same room as

266
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:13,110
the hackathon instead it's it's upstairs

267
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:16,910
I think one flight and in the park Mont

268
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,070
Royal room so Oh

269
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,660
and if you want to do that you have to

270
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,720
make sure that you've registered there's

271
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,060
a link in the wiki for that make sure

272
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,220
you register by noon on Monday so we can

273
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,689
set up the space accordingly and that's

274
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,200
opened and everyone who's here at the

275
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,970
hackathon and anyone can come and attend

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,500
so the other thing is we'll have the

277
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,230
code lounge in case you just want a

278
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,730
convenient space to continue to meet and

279
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,530
work on code and this will be set up

280
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,210
throughout the week in that same space

281
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:51,230
that the hack demo happy hour happened

282
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:53,270
upstairs and you can sign up for that

283
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,520
but you don't have to the sign up is

284
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,670
just meant as a convenience right to

285
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,170
make it easier for you to work together

286
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,640
with your team let others know when

287
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,560
you're going to be there but you can

288
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,330
just drop in anytime as well and we

289
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,949
thank our sponsors again just thank you

290
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,990
very much we wouldn't all be here and be

291
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,590
able to do this if we didn't have the

292
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:21,800
great help and support of the sponsors

293
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:24,320
and our supporters and Alyssa mentioned

294
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,500
Twitter you know there's it'd be great

295
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,680
if you do share some information out

296
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,320
there fun things cool things things you

297
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,099
learned whatever photos from the

298
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,060
hackathon the hashtags we use our ITF

299
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,230
hackathon and then put the IAT f-105

300
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:48,229
hashtag in there too just makes it easy

301
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:50,180
for people to find and with that any

302
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,280
questions again you're welcome to come

303
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,560
up and ask me afterwards but if you have

304
00:12:52,280 --> 00:13:05,089
a question to everyone benefit from I

305
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:06,709
welcome that now as well okay great well

306
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,810
thanks very much for your attention I'll

307
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,550
let you get back to what you're doing

308
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,260
you can see this is a picture from last

309
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,380
year looked a little similar but not

310
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,930
quite as full as this year so enjoy

311
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:24,480
happy hacking and thanks for being here

312
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,479
[Applause]
