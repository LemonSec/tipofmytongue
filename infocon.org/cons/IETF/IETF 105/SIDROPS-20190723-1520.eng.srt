1
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:59,490
don't be such a way to they take in

2
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,050
their current laser frequency much and

3
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,050
most of these huge

4
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:17,810
I found you a minute taker no fear helps

5
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,239
friend of ours first an idea it

6
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:31,430
immediately becomes part of the machine

7
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:54,980
yeah about half of your cooking some of

8
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:59,060
your money good afternoon welcome to the

9
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:05,079
cider ops meeting at IETF 105 we're in

10
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:08,269
Montreal it's not even cold okay is it

11
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,610
okay that's right it's cold inside not

12
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:13,310
outside okay

13
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,700
I'm Chris that's care that's Joe over

14
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:21,380
there helping out yeoman's work we have

15
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:25,280
a we have a note-taker we also have the

16
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,730
watch more collet note well note-taker

17
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,980
we I think we need a jabber scribe still

18
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:35,328
does somebody want to jabber and I don't

19
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:40,160
meet at the mic Gary I thought you not

20
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:44,660
it no aha okay Warren we'll Jever all

21
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,070
right so before we go through the a Obi

22
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,280
and I know somebody's gonna stand up and

23
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,480
get off my business for those people

24
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
that speak at the mic please

25
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,960
thank you very much good example the

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,730
thingy has a pointy pointy on it you can

27
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,840
point like this there's a thing in front

28
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,320
of you so you don't have to do this

29
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,850
because also this is rude all right

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,040
Oh is there any other business that you

31
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:25,260
would like to discuss that we can add to

32
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:28,140
the agenda may I add one item certainly

33
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:32,550
depending on the item the item is about

34
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:41,550
diversity diversity diversity diver I'm

35
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:42,750
sorry about my boom Tish what's the only

36
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,790
other half the internet we care about

37
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,730
yes why don't we do that as soon as mr.

38
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:50,130
Bush is done with his time fantastic

39
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,950
thank you thank you very much okay we

40
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,060
have these four other presenters and mr.

41
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,890
mandersohn will be a little squeezed on

42
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,720
time I think so everybody should keep it

43
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,010
short draft status as it says the

44
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,240
documentation all these slides by the

45
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,210
way are in the meeting material so you

46
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,860
can go down to that and could go to town

47
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,870
a couple of things were moved from the

48
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,530
IHC processing to editors queue that's

49
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,510
the towel and the router King draft and

50
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,340
we added some ASPA stuff and the valve

51
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,710
editing BGP speaker that we're still

52
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:33,000
working on all right yeah sigh it's

53
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:34,289
awesome okay so go back Alexander oh you

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,110
should also feel free to either hold the

55
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,110
mic or use the little thingy stand

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,450
not smile slides oh this is my slits

57
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,670
okay

58
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,099
my name is a reason does enough work for

59
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:00,480
Yandex and today I'm going to provide

60
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:04,530
you a very short update on his PA trots

61
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,710
so just to quickly remind remind you

62
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,200
what our ASP so this day is also a

63
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,630
system provider authorization so but

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,849
it's P is much shorter so it's a new

65
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,719
application object-- then it can be used

66
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,290
to detect leaks and hijacks malicious

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,990
and mistakes it is it works outside of

68
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:29,790
BGP itself so it doesn't change the

69
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:32,310
protocol and of course it can be

70
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:42,560
optimized with bgp roles but it's out of

71
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:45,810
scope so right here is the change log

72
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,300
first of all good news the drafts were

73
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:52,800
adopted by these working group and i

74
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,800
hope that it will boost the process of

75
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,640
working on this document and it seems

76
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,520
this i was right

77
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,419
so since recent discussion in the main

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,060
at least was quite fruitful and

79
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:09,180
previously we were stated that SBA can

80
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,110
be used to verify ice paths that are

81
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,650
received from customers and peers so now

82
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:19,350
we have extended the way SP can be used

83
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,659
and so you can now also verify paths

84
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,940
that are received from customers we are

85
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,919
not speaking here about forged ice part

86
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,620
but we are speaking about mistake

87
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,549
mistake root leaks and it is quite

88
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,200
useful feature since all other drafts

89
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,380
that are targeted around leak detection

90
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:42,510
are not capable to detect leaks on an

91
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:46,800
customer side which also made a universe

92
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:49,830
rule for what we should do with

93
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,050
anomalies so it must be all anomalies

94
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,050
hijacks root leaks must be rejected I

95
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,420
will go in the intro details further

96
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:05,400
later sorry

97
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:09,360
and so let's get some details so there

98
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,190
is a some text there I which I will go

99
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:17,390
over with youth and so it will not look

100
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:19,620
such complicated so if s speaking about

101
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,289
the prefixes that I received from

102
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,240
customer or by customer from provider or

103
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:30,840
exam from Ike's it may have to subpaths

104
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,030
the down the upstream part when prefix

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,720
is traveling from customer to provide

106
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,789
and so on so on and downstream path when

107
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,640
prefix is traveling down from provider

108
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,409
to customer and so on the connection can

109
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,510
be a single autonomous system number it

110
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:49,650
can be appearing link it can be a

111
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:54,090
transparent eyes but anyway the first

112
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,579
downstream link will will have invalid

113
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,710
outcome

114
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:01,830
according to ASP a verification

115
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:08,070
procedure so in this exact example

116
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:11,250
example r3 is leaking as one is taking

117
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,310
transit from ice to s3 taking transit

118
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,680
from both eyes to and I is for ice five

119
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:21,569
straight a contrasting from ice form so

120
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,060
I hope it will be clear so according to

121
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,810
his be verification procedure the

122
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:32,250
outcome from verification of ice 2 and R

123
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:36,859
3 is invalid as soon as we are going

124
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:41,210
through first downstream link all

125
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:45,780
concern downstream leaks the links that

126
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:48,560
we can find after that in the path will

127
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:54,140
must be also provided to customers

128
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:58,619
otherwise it's a leak so to verify this

129
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,620
but we found that is to in ice 3 is

130
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,600
invalid and after this we check is for

131
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,300
in the ice 3 it's very important to

132
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,450
check as find ice 3 instead of ice 3 and

133
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,310
is for because otherwise we are eaten in

134
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,079
problems with siblings

135
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:21,589
and so if we have these two in reddit

136
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:25,888
the result is that the in the downstream

137
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:29,360
sub path there is some supper there is a

138
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:32,100
sequence which goes up so it surrounded

139
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,009
so I understand it may sound a bit

140
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,470
difficult but in reality it's a very

141
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,600
easy to code and I have already already

142
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,139
dropped a piece of code in the main at

143
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,360
least you can take a look at it so maybe

144
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:50,329
in words it's harder to understand then

145
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:55,069
in the piece of code so the second thing

146
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:58,979
is universe policy for anomalies

147
00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:02,309
previously we try to treat different

148
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,589
layer hijacks and root leaks we had good

149
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:08,969
intent we believed that it's in some

150
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:11,519
cases root leaks may pass by because

151
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,269
maybe it's a good thing maybe it's the

152
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:20,430
only path to the originator but since

153
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:23,970
we're talking not only about mistakes

154
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:28,050
we're also talking about forged a cubes

155
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:32,220
of the malicious activity the receiver

156
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:35,430
cannot distinguish if it was it is

157
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,399
receiving a prefix that was leaked by a

158
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:43,258
mistake or if it's a receiving F forged

159
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:46,370
eyes party which is a hijack but I spats

160
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:50,250
most of us modified to look like a leak

161
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,370
so with this in mind we we cannot

162
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,100
distinguish leaks and ice and hijacks

163
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,769
from the receiver side and the only

164
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,589
policy that can be applicable here is

165
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:08,610
draw all anomalies that can be detected

166
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:10,079
with ASP so what do we learn next we're

167
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,269
planning to make some proof of concept

168
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,388
in the lab we haven't yet decided how to

169
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:18,749
do it we are still in discussion at this

170
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:22,490
moment point we need to bomb the version

171
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:25,139
of our TR protocol unfortunately it's

172
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,809
not extendable to it be

173
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,809
Jews without increasing the version

174
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:33,809
number and it seems this if we don't

175
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:36,389
find any great security flaws in the

176
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,910
design we need nearly ready for working

177
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:41,269
group Moscow

178
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,269
any questions

179
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:55,330
I see rue Daguerre it is nearly going to

180
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,280
ask a question job Snyder's entity why

181
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,890
did you put the deprecated asset

182
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,189
configuration set reference on this

183
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,060
slide it's a good question it's a my

184
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:10,900
question to you to the working group so

185
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:15,489
because it's for a proper ice path of

186
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:18,150
diversification we cannot verify hiset

187
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:22,600
segments because they are unordered and

188
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:25,569
if we want to get rid of malicious

189
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,570
activity that may happen in BGP we need

190
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,940
to get rid of Isis and that's why it's

191
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,620
here and that's why I'm like to another

192
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,590
to learn what's happening with this

193
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,840
draft and if there is anybody willing to

194
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,910
push it forward to finally get reach of

195
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,670
the highest sets because from the

196
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:53,410
security perspective we are relying on

197
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:55,209
this piece of the document and I know

198
00:13:53,410 --> 00:14:11,650
that the authors of these dolphins are

199
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:12,880
here I mean that's been sitting around

200
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,850
for a long time

201
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,320
that document and mainly Shri Rama had

202
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,070
been bumping the version number every

203
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,920
now and then what we decided at some

204
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,900
point was and Randy and I had started

205
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,780
working on this and then I got

206
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,760
sidetracked again but we'd started

207
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,850
another document which deprecates ASX

208
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,050
and atomic aggregate from BGP v4 we

209
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,580
hadn't hadn't actually got as far as

210
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,020
publishing a version of that but that

211
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,270
seemed like would be a much better thing

212
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,730
to actually do it turns out doing that

213
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,490
requires all sorts of updates to BGP

214
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,100
like lots of remove this text add this

215
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,510
text marry this text add this text and

216
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,920
then yeah I got a little sidetracked I

217
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,230
mean if it's really a useful we could

218
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,829
look at it again and Randy might have

219
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,200
more to say but from a state perspective

220
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,720
if it will have something that will

221
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:06,520
already a little state that

222
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,980
ice I said are deprecated we'll be able

223
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,140
to say that if we see an I said for

224
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,700
example apply the same policies for the

225
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,830
hijacks it leaks and just drop it I

226
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,050
believe the current version is basically

227
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,480
like ready if somebody wanted to adopt

228
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,000
it and do something with it but honestly

229
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,610
I haven't touched it and like you know a

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:32,650
year or something two years yeah I see

231
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,720
fear on either life through damp mist I

232
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,829
just want to add that there's a version

233
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,110
of it which is already a BCP and then we

234
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,680
wanted to convert it to a standards

235
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,550
track so hopefully the BCP is helpful

236
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,310
somewhat in the meantime but we can work

237
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:54,819
on it to see if we can push it through

238
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:57,130
instant extract as well wait I will be

239
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,680
glad to see if these piece of work will

240
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,640
be finally adopted and to end up with

241
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,910
our sisters if nothing else happens as

242
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:11,470
far as I can tell the interesting

243
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:16,540
construct only occurs at the very end of

244
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:24,880
a path you're speaking about this thing

245
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:30,219
no no no no no no the is set and the way

246
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:35,680
it usually is constructed is not

247
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:39,610
relevant here at all and if nothing else

248
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,760
happens one would need to check that yes

249
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:48,160
it only can happen at the end and then

250
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:51,580
you could essentially just use the

251
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:56,969
regular path for whatever is happening

252
00:16:51,580 --> 00:17:00,040
here assume assume that the first

253
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:07,030
regular AAS that shows up in the path

254
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:09,879
and the set is hidden behind it to be

255
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,160
the origin and you are fine because all

256
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,459
all the tricky stuff that is happening

257
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,490
inside the AAS set doesn't well okay

258
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:22,480
does absolutely not fit into this model

259
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,029
anyway and it doesn't matter yes I do

260
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,459
agree with you but there's a moment sure

261
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:31,000
that the certification doesn't say

262
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:33,429
anything about if we can if I said in

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,909
the middle of this ice bath is well it

264
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:39,190
are invented so to walk or to fight

265
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:42,720
forged ice path we should avoid at least

266
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,090
I set in the middle of middle I do agree

267
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,460
ok and I've as far as I have observed

268
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,459
them they never were somewhere in the

269
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,880
middle and there is a good reason for

270
00:17:51,460 --> 00:18:00,460
that

271
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:03,789
yeah yes well okay yeah all okay

272
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:08,159
unfortunately I don't have I'd well okay

273
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,158
yes let me let me put it into a question

274
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:16,480
[Applause]

275
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:23,289
what it's improve the understanding of

276
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:30,299
the old thing if we did a part in the

277
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:35,260
documents that essentially reveals the

278
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:45,510
concept of what is signed in the in VA

279
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:49,210
in VA SBA's the complex asn.1 use

280
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:56,320
typically typically confuses people who

281
00:18:49,210 --> 00:19:03,460
don't need to work with it and i think i

282
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:06,700
think that the conceptual data structure

283
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,270
that is transmitted there and what what

284
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:14,649
it's supposed semantics are could be

285
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:17,260
exposed much better and i somewhat

286
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:22,299
assume actually the structure will after

287
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:25,600
the will the the encoding might actually

288
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:28,690
change to adapt it closer to a concept

289
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:33,459
that's being that's being used

290
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,500
are you speaking about is zero no yeah

291
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,620
well okay what what is the concept that

292
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,730
is being used you are coding a sets of a

293
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:47,340
SS and you are doing some strange trick

294
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:52,750
in case you want to code an empty set

295
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:59,520
and kind of why why not why not actually

296
00:19:52,750 --> 00:20:03,010
explain this and then code like it I

297
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,920
remember that we had this question

298
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:09,010
discussed we discussed privately so my

299
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:13,110
idea when I was writing its introducing

300
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:17,950
ic0 was I was taking a look it's raw

301
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:22,389
document and just taking its design to

302
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:24,670
look similar so obvious row 0 and we

303
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:27,520
have a space here oh I'm not saying the

304
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:30,040
edge is yeah all okay but the qualifier

305
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,730
the final solution but anyway it's it's

306
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,770
very simple and from perspective of the

307
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,920
coding tools it doesn't really matter

308
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:42,250
you know do you have sets or do you have

309
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:45,160
separate records from the implementation

310
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,130
side it's nearly the same kind of going

311
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,980
to configure it by yourself all all

312
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:58,060
metals all met all small matters of

313
00:20:50,980 --> 00:21:00,550
coding agreed for making people

314
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,690
understand what they are supposed to do

315
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:11,860
and why things work well kind of coding

316
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:16,150
complications can be an obstacle and yes

317
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:21,969
I also I also have another now unhidden

318
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:29,230
agenda if we actually are coding sets of

319
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:32,460
a SS that means that during the time the

320
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,770
standard is de is being developed and

321
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:40,500
codes an implementation and deployment

322
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,500
follows over a couple of months

323
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:49,149
actually the concept could be used by

324
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,360
people who agree on how to code in other

325
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:57,330
ways that are already available the sets

326
00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:02,020
of a SS to actually to actually use the

327
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:06,220
the technique kind of essentially

328
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,799
immediately yeah but anyway generating

329
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:14,070
for example using ice pass filtering

330
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:16,629
using wildcards you will anyway end up

331
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,520
with some generator of your

332
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:24,010
configuration I'm pretty sure that you

333
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:26,649
will not use click it you can click on

334
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,360
generate and so it doesn't should not

335
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:34,719
really matter if you are working with a

336
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:38,979
set Vaughn a set of tuples the the issue

337
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,789
here is much less the coding which may

338
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,649
be slightly easier or while okay it

339
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:48,220
doesn't matter and I completely agree

340
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:51,100
that yes completely hand coding stuff is

341
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,399
out of the question

342
00:22:51,100 --> 00:23:00,070
but making making the concept that is

343
00:22:54,399 --> 00:23:05,439
used transparent to users actually

344
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:08,590
actually is valuable because ok of

345
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,760
course with a little bit of coding the

346
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,860
user interface can also present concepts

347
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,919
that are kind of hidden in what's

348
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:23,469
happening underneath but that does not

349
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:26,200
that does not really help ok ok kind of

350
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:29,350
kind of kind of for details offline

351
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,700
discussion quite obviously make sense so

352
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:37,199
thank you really good for our comments a

353
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:46,270
really quick question sorry about him if

354
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:48,429
you take es conflicts out do you want to

355
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,879
propose what should be done if an es

356
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,640
conferred is encounter so is it simply

357
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,350
ignore it and go to the next AAS in this

358
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,690
a sequence if we're speaking about

359
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,590
protection against malicious activity

360
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:08,020
approached I said in the middle of the

361
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,530
path just nibble eighths all kinds of

362
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,629
protection because it will end up that

363
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,210
you are able to create a forged ice bath

364
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:20,650
in certain situations so at the moment

365
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:23,650
the draft suggests to treat pass with

366
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,250
ice set like it sweets hijacks and

367
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,020
leagues all right thank you

368
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,900
um yeah a question or clarification

369
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,990
because on a check that my understanding

370
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,440
is correct

371
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:40,510
laughs so in my understanding the

372
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,550
semantics here are similar to what you

373
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,610
have an origin validation in the sense

374
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:47,290
that you would argue to drop in ballots

375
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,830
so if there's anything verifiably

376
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:53,950
invalid but when things are unknown

377
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:58,600
that's okay yes right okay because the

378
00:24:53,950 --> 00:25:01,600
text in the document seemed to say

379
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,939
something about treating unverifiable

380
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,199
things with some suspicion and I'm not

381
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,150
sure that that's right there is

382
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,240
difference between unverifiable and

383
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:16,630
unknown and verifiable is exactly

384
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:21,700
introduced for Isis well unknown is for

385
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:24,340
ice baths so the ice bath even returns I

386
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,610
think well it's in case of so there is a

387
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,590
purification there is three outcomes

388
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,909
valid invalid unknown for ice bath

389
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:36,610
verification procedure it should be

390
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:41,050
valid invalid and algorithm so the

391
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:44,080
unknown will be wedded right okay that

392
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,909
clarifies thank you so I think if I come

393
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,810
to I will check that it is clearly

394
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:52,170
stated and maybe somewhat related that

395
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:54,370
we can also talk about that offline but

396
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,890
there is an es who makes a statement

397
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,580
here a signed statement and I asked

398
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:06,790
earlier like maybe we should think about

399
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:07,199
how to to make that object because what

400
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,090
I'm look

401
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,190
for what I'm thinking of as a missus a

402
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:14,189
year if there's an SMAS I make a

403
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,620
statement maybe I run one object signed

404
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,700
by a yes that has everything in it to

405
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:23,729
ensure that I see the complete policy

406
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,240
that's applicable here and not risk that

407
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,470
there are issues with a bunch of objects

408
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,840
where some of them are being published

409
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,950
and withdrawn and so that may be

410
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,980
something to think about

411
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,519
because it would row us that's different

412
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,610
because there if you put multiple

413
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:44,279
prefixes on a single row and one of the

414
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,080
prefixes goes away then the object

415
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,970
becomes invalid but if this is signed by

416
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,129
only one a s then you don't have that

417
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,010
problem so you may want to think about

418
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,019
that I'm not sure that a properly gets

419
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,559
your question let's discuss it's out of

420
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,200
line

421
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,690
yes what I'm buying is that maybe if one

422
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,580
a s makes a statement or a bunch of

423
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:08,880
statements they can put them all in one

424
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:12,678
object but it can be single areas may

425
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:16,110
create objects only for either

426
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,090
originating out on system number so you

427
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,399
are creating objects for your providers

428
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,928
you can make it create more objects but

429
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,439
anyway your great your objects only for

430
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:29,909
your providers so what I'm implying is

431
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,799
that as AAS who is signing I could put

432
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:36,600
all those statements on a single object

433
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:39,690
so there's no risk that when I publish

434
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,428
things you miss things because you know

435
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,010
it's still being processed and it's

436
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,659
partially published itself so it's not a

437
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:48,110
big deal but you know maybe something to

438
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,000
think about okay okay thank you

439
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,760
Geoff Huston look I'm not sure that

440
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,909
actually need a single object the

441
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,820
underlying constraint is if you sign one

442
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:03,600
of your adjacencies you need to sign all

443
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,269
of your adjacencies okay how can I be

444
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,870
adjacent to an AS set and what might it

445
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:11,370
look like and this is this sort of weird

446
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,469
thing where you're cutting out I need a

447
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,739
guess it's deprecated but I actually

448
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:20,039
don't even understand how if I'm signing

449
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,090
all my adjacencies how I can sign myself

450
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,190
as adjacent

451
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,459
and is set within your construct and

452
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,830
maybe that just simply finesses out the

453
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,230
entire issue of ASAS because I can't be

454
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,480
adjacent to one unless a whole bunch of

455
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,060
other work is done to define what I'm

456
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,400
adjacent to so if I sign all my

457
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,370
adjacencies and you see a park with me

458
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,770
adjacent to one of these a assets I

459
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:48,360
think that's a dud you know straight

460
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:51,210
away Thanks I'd like to stay just one

461
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,929
saw one more time no problem with I sit

462
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:58,880
in the in the bath is the PISA this it

463
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:04,290
is unordered it's not it's not the

464
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,630
number so it doesn't matter it just

465
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,129
doesn't matter I'm like you're inside an

466
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,890
environment where when maybe you get a

467
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,450
path until you reach some gold and

468
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,960
healthy and day that's never going to

469
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,390
happen

470
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,580
that everyone signs stuff you're gonna

471
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,710
have to do partials yeah and if you're

472
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,620
doing partials no one's going to be

473
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,930
incorporating if I'm if I do my signing

474
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,879
I'm never adjacent to a set the problem

475
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,160
just goes away that's what I'm

476
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,160
suggesting Chris you can have the time

477
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm not sure that I fully get your idea

478
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:38,400
I will try to reach your later thank you

479
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,790
quick

480
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,460
Chad much Akamai I don't know how many

481
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,060
ASI Jason sees I have it's actually an

482
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,970
unknown

483
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,550
it's an unanswerable question for me so

484
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:54,780
I I don't know I wouldn't even have a

485
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,700
way to sign something to say who I chase

486
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,950
it with because I fear with things like

487
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,340
route servers so I have very many

488
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:06,030
unknown es adjacencies just for my

489
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,590
backbone a s but how many upstream

490
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,080
providers do have we are not speaking

491
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,669
about signing all adjacencies when

492
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,939
speaking about only signing your IP

493
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:17,400
transit providers it is still a little

494
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,040
bit indeterminate that I might be able

495
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,700
to answer but some of the people the

496
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,250
agreement

497
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,160
it looks like peering but it may

498
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,140
actually be more like transit so

499
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,680
sometimes the source relationships are a

500
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,070
little bit fuzzy we're not trying to

501
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:38,280
define complex business relations

502
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,800
the only thing that a speii does is if

503
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,820
you create a record you are just be

504
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:49,200
meeting what is called provider to send

505
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,540
your prefixes to up streams or peers and

506
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,580
so on you are free for example not to

507
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,490
pay me to one of your providers to send

508
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:03,120
prefixes you can do it it's it's up to

509
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:04,740
you so the the core idea is that yes you

510
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,080
never know you all your agencies is

511
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,660
because of transparent access it's not

512
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,949
possible but to list your providers

513
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:19,530
I think 99% of eyespace in the world

514
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:21,060
will be capable to do it okay there's a

515
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,040
much a conversation that probably needs

516
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,030
to go on the mailing list for this I

517
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:43,230
think would be a lot of help more

518
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:45,300
helpful Daniel so I would like to

519
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,890
present to you our draft again I have

520
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,850
been at the last ITF meeting at Prague

521
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,270
so this time I will give you an update

522
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:56,969
and we would like to go for last call

523
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:59,670
soon to finish this draft so this is

524
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:02,550
about how to use rpki validation at

525
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:05,910
route servers and how to forward the

526
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:07,770
result to the peers so the draft is

527
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,530
around 4:00 already about three years

528
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,470
more than three years and they have been

529
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,080
some substantial changes inside like

530
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:19,110
edit modes of operation how to do it at

531
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,830
a route server and how to forward result

532
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:26,790
appears so the last feedback from the

533
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:30,270
ITF 104 is basically about which

534
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:34,200
community to use and which mode of

535
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:36,750
operation to run at default the

536
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,830
motivation for this draft was basically

537
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:43,290
to have something like our C 1897 which

538
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:48,418
says how to forward época validation

539
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:51,570
results in interior PGP so at X piece we

540
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,090
have some kind of similar situation we

541
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:57,840
run kind of a more trusted environment

542
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:01,559
to the peers and it's natural for ex

543
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,379
piece to forward some information with

544
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:06,989
with routes for example where the route

545
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:08,248
has been learned from how far like

546
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:10,409
what's the round-trip time to the

547
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:12,559
drought things like that so we would

548
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:15,629
like to do the same with rpki

549
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,389
protect result of a PKI onto the road

550
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:20,570
so that would be makes sense to make

551
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:23,399
routing positions for monitoring

552
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,039
troubleshooting maintenance or just to

553
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:31,408
record it to have educational or to do

554
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:34,139
some research about it so just to get a

555
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:38,369
picture on how it works some of you

556
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:40,709
already know it we get an prefix from

557
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:43,049
for example a SD that goes into a route

558
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:47,639
server there are servers doing all its

559
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:50,369
usual checks also doing our D check see

560
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:53,399
if the prefixes valid for the a s if

561
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:56,209
it's an is a a set and additionally this

562
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:59,070
time it will also do our PK validation

563
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,690
then it can have different modes for

564
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,658
example it can drop the prefix right

565
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,999
away or it can just forward the prefixes

566
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,250
and take the state the result of the

567
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:10,589
state onto the route to the to the

568
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,909
neighbors and then it should go to the

569
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:14,578
neighbors but the neighbors shouldn't

570
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,290
redistribute this to others it's just

571
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:21,480
the idea to have this at the domain of

572
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:23,790
the IXP so technically we now changed

573
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,210
from an extended community to a large

574
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:30,329
community because this has been feedback

575
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:33,990
from the last ITF meeting and it's now

576
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:38,099
our standard so basically it would be we

577
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:41,908
would have the habilitation um status at

578
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:44,730
the last field which would be like zero

579
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:47,549
for if it's a valid prefix one if it's

580
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,629
not found it's unknown or two if it's an

581
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:54,389
invalid prefix we would also have the

582
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:57,690
function of function specific number to

583
00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:00,420
signal the desist a PKI prefix

584
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,830
validation community and we would have

585
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,880
the ASN

586
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:08,990
of the of the XP for example that is

587
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,990
distributing this validation result

588
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,230
inside the route server that would have

589
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,440
there would be different modes of

590
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:19,620
operation available the first node would

591
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,570
be to just tag the result that routes of

592
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,900
a processed on to order out and

593
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,550
distributed to the peers the second mode

594
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,450
of operation would be to drop all

595
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:33,330
invalid prefixes and just forward valid

596
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,009
ones and unknowns so this would be now

597
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:39,029
the default mode of operation and is

598
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:42,000
basically like what is done today at

599
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:45,660
severai expand the third mode would be

600
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,180
to to drop prefixes with invalid and

601
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,089
unknown but basically do the best path

602
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,339
selection after dead saw that valid

603
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:58,020
routes would remain like on top of all

604
00:35:53,340 --> 00:36:01,320
errors operational recommendations in

605
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,090
the draft is that peers that receive the

606
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,110
result should not redistribute it to a

607
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:10,320
DA is ends if a route server is

608
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,630
receiving such a community from from a

609
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,740
peer it should strip it so that it will

610
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,960
not redistribute

611
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:21,330
other checks then was also common is

612
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,370
that if the very origin relation fails

613
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,029
at a route server the community should

614
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,870
be admitted

615
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:30,930
there should be no community and then if

616
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,130
there's multiple validation results for

617
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,500
appear if it receives multiple

618
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,820
validation results the validation was

619
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,120
art with the highest values should be

620
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,160
should be taken that would be two for

621
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:45,509
invalid for example so it's the most

622
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,700
secure way to do it so comments from the

623
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,470
last meeting have been that we shouldn't

624
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,129
or there should be a mechanism to a

625
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:55,410
signal if the validation could be

626
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,480
performed throughout server and we have

627
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,580
this now and operational recommendations

628
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,640
to admit the community tech at the route

629
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,710
server then one comment was that the

630
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,830
draft has been overtaken by reality

631
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:11,550
which means that now more and more XP s

632
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:13,710
already drop in billets but I see it

633
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,400
like this that things of the draft are

634
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,650
now already implemented kind of

635
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,260
and we also define the communities to

636
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:22,359
tag on and also if you go for example to

637
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,000
the looking class you can see at some

638
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:26,589
ISPs that are already using communities

639
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,029
you can't just see that you don't see it

640
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:30,069
on your router but you see that

641
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:33,160
internally there are servers already

642
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:34,808
using these communities then we had a

643
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,910
discussion about extended and large

644
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:40,029
communities we now resided in favor for

645
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,819
large communities there was always the

646
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:45,760
concern of outsourcing security that

647
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:47,500
means that you are giving like the

648
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,240
security there is a decision to the

649
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,549
route server but this is some some

650
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,828
trade-off that appears doing anyway it

651
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:57,069
is peace and there's kind of a trusted

652
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:59,079
relationship and then also discussion

653
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:00,730
was always to drop envelopes by default

654
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,970
which we know it up did in the draft

655
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:05,589
yeah so with this I'm open to more

656
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:14,049
comments and as I said we would like to

657
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:15,819
finish this draft fairly soon that

658
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:17,440
Montgomery but back one slide what's the

659
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:19,119
scenario where you get to validation

660
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,460
results it was like the last bullet of

661
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:27,760
the previous slide yeah the last point

662
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:31,089
here when what's the scenario and when

663
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,180
you win this if your router is maybe

664
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:36,069
peering with different route servers and

665
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:39,629
there's - giving you different different

666
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:44,319
results of the validation for a prefix

667
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:48,279
so let me try there's two route servers

668
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:50,288
at Dax I appear with both of them they

669
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:52,990
happen to be unsynched with their

670
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:55,380
perspective of the rpki data one says

671
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,339
valid one says unknown what should I do

672
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,500
yeah that would be like a failure

673
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:02,279
scenario yeah that true well okay but

674
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,869
these would be two different routes and

675
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:09,339
actually figuring out that you have two

676
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:11,319
routes with different communities I'm

677
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:13,509
not aware of any of the currently

678
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:18,549
available configuration language to have

679
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:20,109
appropriate policy language I think

680
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:22,569
we've talked about this before but not

681
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:26,109
in this context you have no guarantee

682
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:28,930
that the highest value of highest is

683
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:31,328
valid I think that was why your youth

684
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:37,390
you have no guarantee they write it's

685
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:40,960
the more recent data right okay time

686
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,578
time wise I don't know but basically if

687
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,680
it would be at the same time and you

688
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:50,170
should favor the higher value I wasn't

689
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,240
suggesting a race condition I'm saying

690
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:55,390
the idea that you choose the one with

691
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,029
the more favorable validation result

692
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,160
isn't a sign that you're choosing the

693
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:02,710
one that has the more up-to-date rpki

694
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,140
information right it things could be

695
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:07,630
effectively degrading yeah it would be

696
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:12,730
in favor from security I think in this

697
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:15,519
case I think that's I think Doug your

698
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,230
point is that as the data and the RPI is

699
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,450
changing over time I may choose to

700
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,849
validate I may choose to authorize you

701
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:25,118
to do this route today and job tomorrow

702
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:26,859
and not you tomorrow and if the data at

703
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,470
the to different route servers is in a

704
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,880
state where one has the old data you and

705
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,828
the other one has the good the new data

706
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,779
job I certainly don't want to accept the

707
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:37,539
route with you in it anymore can i

708
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:39,369
injecting sense or abortionist we made

709
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:42,910
an awful lot of tests last year about

710
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:44,980
that and you can have the following

711
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,799
situation let's assume you have a route

712
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,989
on the East Coast and you have a router

713
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:52,140
on the west coast and they exchange

714
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:54,460
their data and they have the same path

715
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,160
those who have two different validation

716
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,960
caches I don't know which of the

717
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,170
validation cache has more up-to-date

718
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,910
data it might be that the one that

719
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,089
resorts a novella is more up-to-date

720
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,940
than the one that has the other result

721
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:12,788
it also might be that the one vision in

722
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,769
Belet has more up-to-date data than the

723
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:18,450
one with a valid so I cannot say just

724
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:22,618
because I think out of security

725
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:25,569
because it might be a security that

726
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:30,999
caused a certain prefix to be all of a

727
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:32,609
sudden venit so what now okay I take

728
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:37,480
this as a good comment photographed

729
00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:39,489
thank you job Snyder's and CT in the

730
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,190
case of failure in the original

731
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:44,770
foundation process for instance

732
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,260
how do you how do you define failure of

733
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,200
the original foundation process because

734
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,460
for instance if the cache is empty

735
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,529
policy will dictate that all of them

736
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,230
become unknown and then omitting the

737
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:59,619
community is a force signal in this

738
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:02,440
conflict that contradicts with what we

739
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:06,760
understand that unknowns are or not

740
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,890
found so we cannot differentiate I think

741
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,200
between a failure in the urgent

742
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,440
validation process or the absence of a

743
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:18,490
validation process yeah I see this

744
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,190
problem as well and then a second

745
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,490
comment if the default is to reject

746
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:27,180
invalids

747
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:31,419
maybe you should remove the well-known

748
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:33,368
invalids community and then only two

749
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,250
communities are left the unknowns and

750
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:40,059
valid and at that point I kind of wonder

751
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:45,990
what the use case is because I I think

752
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:49,450
it's not very valuable and you should

753
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:51,220
reconsider the words that we can trust

754
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,859
each other at an internet exchange I

755
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,450
fully agree from a commercial incentive

756
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:57,848
if I were working for an internet

757
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:02,649
exchange but we in the transit world say

758
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:06,849
transit is what you trust okay so you

759
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:10,329
shouldn't yet you sought service or John

760
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:13,059
Scudder now that you explained what the

761
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:18,369
last bullet means I would like to agree

762
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:20,410
with rüdiger that one route has one

763
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:23,680
validation state it doesn't make sense

764
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:28,660
to talk about having multiple validation

765
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,549
states for a route and as as I

766
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,259
understand I have I would need to go and

767
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:34,900
I haven't looked at this version of the

768
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,640
draft so I don't know what the normative

769
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,819
language is but it sounds to me like

770
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,259
that should just be removed because it

771
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:43,180
doesn't make sense to say their route

772
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,099
has two different validations days it

773
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:49,470
only has one and it's the one that the

774
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,470
route server told me alright thank you

775
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:59,560
Randy push hi Jamarcus oh I have

776
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,760
problems with the trust nozzle also but

777
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,940
that's been beaten to death

778
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:10,300
um why you switched which tomorrow day

779
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:14,020
confuses me we already have a well then

780
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:17,400
one and Burton Lee not well-known one

781
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:21,370
but a well-defined one um but basically

782
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,830
as you'll see the real problem that's

783
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:26,319
expressed in the original validation

784
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:29,259
signaling graph which you'll get to hear

785
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:34,030
about boringly later is that saying the

786
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:36,960
community gets to my router but then

787
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:40,810
what they're like German if it's invalid

788
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,500
okay and the problem is that I want to

789
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:49,500
cause withdrawal and we haven't quite

790
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,500
got the route map semantics for that

791
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:56,980
yeah the community was changed because

792
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,540
of the comments from the last meeting so

793
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,420
I understood that this is the right way

794
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:04,509
to go and the default thing that is also

795
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,890
done at route servers so otherwise I

796
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,590
understood that if we want to have

797
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,589
extended communities like it's done with

798
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:13,420
the ibgp draft you have to implement all

799
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,990
the policies and we have to wait like 10

800
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:26,080
years so yeah we thought is this the way

801
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:34,529
to go all right normal comments all

802
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:42,750
right thank you thank you very much Tim

803
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:42,750
believe it is your turn find your aha

804
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:49,290
whoopsy quick thing let me make this to

805
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,290
go to fullscreen

806
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,670
yeah all right

807
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,110
yeah Tim Burgess and on that laughs I'm

808
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:03,240
going to talk about this graph which is

809
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:06,300
actually not a last call as far as I

810
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,450
know but it is on the Status pages I

811
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:12,180
think that's because HDS intell's was in

812
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:15,029
law school so it would be nice to

813
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:21,569
rectify that because this is not

814
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:22,980
finished so goals still this is similar

815
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,130
to the slide deck after that it

816
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:30,710
presented two meetings ago where I said

817
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:34,350
shall we call it done but still no dome

818
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:36,180
and I'll get back to that in a bit

819
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:40,350
actually but let's first look at the

820
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:42,950
goals so we want to allow for key roles

821
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:49,020
in the RPI there are many reasons why

822
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:50,970
but this might be useful I used to work

823
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,500
for write and CC where I was operating a

824
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,720
trust anchor and we have done the

825
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,240
lock-in which regards to an HSM so

826
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:02,250
that's just one of the reasons why this

827
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,709
might be useful for relying parties it's

828
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:07,190
important to learn about these things

829
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:10,950
currently there's no way except for

830
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,900
somehow offline in learning about a new

831
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:16,730
trust anchor locator and including it

832
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:19,620
maybe when you update or your

833
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:22,560
implementation you get a new tell with

834
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:26,910
that update but it's not very well

835
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:33,049
defined so we also want to learn from

836
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:37,049
experience in the DNS we like to have a

837
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:39,720
way for this to be done that you know

838
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:43,130
lands well into the existing standards

839
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,129
so it works well with what's out there

840
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,360
finally leave it's real for our data

841
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,180
clients what I mean by that is that if

842
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,640
you have a piece of software that has

843
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,200
aids for sync on locator in its so

844
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,359
that's it would be the way your your

845
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,990
relying party tool finds the current

846
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,270
certificate

847
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,890
well if that's our data it would be very

848
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,230
nice that you can follow a trail to the

849
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,730
current

850
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:11,910
set up thrust anchors that should be

851
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:15,390
applicable so it was a major Commons on

852
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:17,848
version 2 in Singapore which is when is

853
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:21,440
it safe when do you know that you can

854
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:25,079
actually drop lucky so changes in three

855
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,619
are well I hope that the text is more

856
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:32,220
clear I could ask your first show of

857
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,900
hands who actually try to read it no

858
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:40,379
yeah okay great

859
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:42,960
well I will go through the phases here

860
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,869
on this my deck as well actually but

861
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,369
they try to make the document a bit more

862
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:48,750
clear but regards to what's going on I

863
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:51,480
mean we're starting from a situation but

864
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,190
none of this is applicable how do you

865
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,319
start use this and how do you then do it

866
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,670
use it to make a a role in a plan

867
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:58,619
direction how do you use it to make a

868
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,000
role in long blimp plans of direction

869
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:04,380
that's it

870
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,650
and as mentioned back in Singapore as

871
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,900
well the draft now uses distinct your

872
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:14,309
eyes for where you can retrieve the TA

873
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:16,200
certificates in an attempts to help

874
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:17,730
figure out how many people are actually

875
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,118
learning about this stuff and how many

876
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:24,510
people support the standard if it

877
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,549
becomes wrong now the objects this is

878
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,710
say someone this may be bit painful for

879
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:33,140
people but essentially it says that

880
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:35,670
there has to be one or more current keys

881
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:39,660
the current key is defined as a sequence

882
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:41,400
of or a sequence of certificate Euron so

883
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,200
it's bunch of your eyes and subject

884
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,150
public key info and in fact that's

885
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,750
exactly the same information as you find

886
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:53,130
on a tell file what an ace and 1d are

887
00:49:48,750 --> 00:50:00,890
formats rather than via text you can

888
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:00,890
also have zero or more revoked keys so

889
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:06,180
current situation you have none of this

890
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,359
right you have the trust and can locate

891
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:14,790
a faulty a text file it contains a bunch

892
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:17,850
of your eyes and the the subject of key

893
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:20,220
info of a tracker

894
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:22,920
certificate so relying party uses that

895
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:27,540
to fetch a certificate verifies it and

896
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:31,200
it goes off a way to introduce this in

897
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:34,110
the phase one let's say is at a or what

898
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:39,899
we call a tech foul to confuse tall

899
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:45,270
UNTAC less I suppose where a signed

900
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,380
object has a reference a URI to a

901
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,120
location where that's ranked a

902
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,420
certificate is signed and the same

903
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,880
subject public info now when a relying

904
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:57,540
party two runs they will encounter this

905
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,460
and the text in the document can he says

906
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,080
or when you learn about these signed

907
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,420
statements you should use the

908
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:06,000
information in there to replace what ya

909
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:08,130
had obtained earlier from the clear text

910
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,190
value were using now if you used

911
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:14,640
different your eyes for both them as an

912
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:18,120
operator you can learn where people

913
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:22,200
fetch things so you can also understand

914
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:26,130
somehow how many people would be able to

915
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:28,140
you know follow its rail let's say so

916
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,900
that's the more significant change I

917
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:33,450
think in this version of the document if

918
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:40,710
you go on though o completeness you can

919
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:45,419
then add a new key have new tag files as

920
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:48,240
a call referencing both keys you could

921
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,270
have tell files for both entry points

922
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:55,080
that say but probably if you in terms to

923
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:59,070
roll to key to here you might want to

924
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:02,310
reach out to relying party software to

925
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:04,620
include that in the distribution or you

926
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:06,299
could actually technically even have a

927
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:11,400
discussion about you know using the

928
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:17,340
design format in in that respect then

929
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:20,970
going further you can roll to a third

930
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:23,310
key and revoke the first one off all the

931
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,620
wrongs in here and I'm not sure that I

932
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:27,029
yeah we can have a discussion about this

933
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,589
you will want but I did present this

934
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:34,300
before let me take away

935
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:39,160
here is that I can revoke that first key

936
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:41,380
on the tech file over the second I don't

937
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,450
need to do that on the third because

938
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:45,160
people who learn about the third key

939
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,830
will have already learned about the

940
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,259
verification of the first by looking at

941
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:52,810
a second the reason that's that

942
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,970
complication is there is because I'd

943
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:56,770
like to avoid having to have a long

944
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,879
trail of what are all the previous

945
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:00,550
revoked keys

946
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,100
we could still include that but you know

947
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:11,350
it might make the object bigger than is

948
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:13,569
strictly necessary so the document

949
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:16,390
actually distinguishes two ways here you

950
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:18,610
could say okay we want to revoke he one

951
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,529
so a TA here or you could say well

952
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,600
actually the one that we just introduced

953
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,790
is no longer good and it would

954
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,910
technically look the same from a a blind

955
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:29,770
party point of view both current keys

956
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:34,060
are just treated equally as current

957
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:35,800
essentially and either key can revoke

958
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,630
all the others now the documents

959
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,610
actually allows for any number of keys

960
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:42,880
and this is another question I think I

961
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:46,870
have for the group as well well that

962
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,400
leaves the the makes a document flexible

963
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:50,980
I think it also makes it more

964
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,290
complicated and strictly necessary if we

965
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,230
could constrain this to scenarios where

966
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:58,600
you only have ever have two keys that

967
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:02,320
might may make things a lot simpler so

968
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,279
that may be well worth it now then

969
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,860
what's next

970
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,630
well well other ways that I thought I

971
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:14,260
included something but no it's in my

972
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:16,870
mind actually wanna do real proof of

973
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,220
concepts work on this and I happened to

974
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:20,589
do that earlier but I didn't get around

975
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:23,250
to it I'm still busy with some other

976
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:27,550
things but arenal to get there because I

977
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:29,380
don't feel confident you know going

978
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:32,020
asking for law school on this unless I

979
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:34,000
have running code that proves that okay

980
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:36,850
we can do a roll we can do a roll where

981
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,460
we went on with our intent we do overall

982
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:42,190
where we figured no distant key is no

983
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,240
longer good and I want to verify that

984
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:47,470
you know following it

985
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:49,629
Phil actually works so even though it

986
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,720
takes longer I would rather you know do

987
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,130
it well then rush it and I'm not

988
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,459
entirely sure that I can form as when

989
00:54:54,130 --> 00:55:00,040
I'll get to it but you know say it is

990
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,990
update that's where I want to go so

991
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,050
question to the chairs I suppose would

992
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:06,910
be please get rid of the status last

993
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:09,340
call because I don't think it's there

994
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:12,580
and to anybody else I mean if you have

995
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:15,070
comments ideas concerns like you know an

996
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,810
old friend here please speak up can be

997
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:19,480
here can be in the hallways on the main

998
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:22,150
list or wherever or if you want to help

999
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:28,119
test that's also great of course so

1000
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:30,640
without hey Eric Australia coach Mason

1001
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,680
University so I think this is really

1002
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,180
good I really like the approach you've

1003
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,430
taken and also the fact that you're

1004
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,379
highlighting a problem that I think

1005
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:40,390
exists in DNS SEC among other places

1006
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,190
where understanding what a key role is

1007
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:45,100
is proving to be very difficult because

1008
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:46,570
it wasn't very clear when the protocol

1009
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,830
is designed that key role is a really a

1010
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,810
big thing it's more than just sticking a

1011
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:51,520
key out there using it and then seeking

1012
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,750
a new key out there and using it you

1013
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,640
know they actually wind up having a

1014
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,170
relationship to each other after they've

1015
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,430
been cycled out and whether they're

1016
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,630
still valid they become replay

1017
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,879
vulnerabilities I think there's a lot of

1018
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:02,350
like thinking through are you rolling

1019
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,670
forward or you're rolling backward and

1020
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,740
how do you actually represent that that

1021
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:07,000
I think you I like the fact that you're

1022
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,589
going to do a lot of analysis I think

1023
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,170
you might also sort of think through

1024
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,700
what are the various states that the

1025
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,070
resource is going to be in as keys

1026
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,899
change and whether keys exist in you

1027
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,220
rolled forward backward and coming with

1028
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:30,100
the taxonomy for that I'd be happy to

1029
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:36,009
work with you if you want sure Randy

1030
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:38,790
Bush IJ anarchists Oh like um like well

1031
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:45,210
enough that would like to see early

1032
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:53,190
security reviews and suggest the chairs

1033
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:53,190
go find some friends over there yes

1034
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:59,270
Bravo Stein arcus uh to your question

1035
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,319
about without you can simplify but

1036
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:03,320
getting rid of some of those infinite

1037
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,670
light sequences given you're talking

1038
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,520
about prototyping at first which i think

1039
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:09,260
is a highly advisable thing li but it's

1040
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,370
open-ended sequences for now and if it

1041
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,140
turns out you don't actually need all

1042
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,029
those slots then you turn them because

1043
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,420
we've been seeing all kinds of

1044
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:19,160
entertaining things lately with people's

1045
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,080
pushing things that were not envisioned

1046
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:28,520
as more than three entries up to ten

1047
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:34,549
thousand let's see what happens marcin

1048
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:37,490
iris and she she the dutch one that's so

1049
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:39,890
you just talked about keys being able to

1050
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,189
revoke other keys and what that's your

1051
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:44,629
security conservation says that

1052
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:48,890
currently any key can revoke any other

1053
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:51,770
key so i was thinking about this too and

1054
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:55,430
i'm wondering if you want to roll a key

1055
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:58,430
because you are not sure that it's safe

1056
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,899
anymore for example that's the property

1057
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:01,549
you're looking for and i don't know what

1058
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:06,290
the property is that you're looking for

1059
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:10,550
but yeah this basically made me question

1060
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:12,380
how that that works so in the i noted in

1061
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:16,100
the last working group that they tried

1062
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:18,200
to get some of the academic formal proof

1063
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,810
groups look at some parts of the

1064
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,660
protocol I'm wondering if that's useful

1065
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:26,480
to be trying to do here with the the P

1066
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,210
key a bit to try and understand if the

1067
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,660
property here looking for are provided

1068
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:35,090
by the functionality you're modeling and

1069
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:39,259
I'm not sure if if anyone's willing and

1070
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:41,380
able to do that but I guess it's this is

1071
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:47,030
a time where you can easily fix

1072
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:49,400
oversight so just questions I suppose ya

1073
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:53,240
know well thank you for for pointers

1074
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,980
because you know speaking for myself I'm

1075
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,330
just making this up and hoping it you

1076
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:01,400
know it works so I can definitely use

1077
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:03,970
good advice sorry I should keep it a

1078
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,970
consistent distance

1079
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:10,460
so but in terms of what we had in mind

1080
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:13,579
is well one of the thoughts is that if

1081
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:17,320
you have an HSM you're usually well

1082
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:20,869
protected against key theft let's say

1083
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,430
but you may still want to do plans rules

1084
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:26,060
because you know you want to change

1085
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:28,879
however or but you can still use a key

1086
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:32,420
as well in particular like if you use

1087
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,950
card sets or people to protect key one

1088
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,920
then you know you may not have a quorum

1089
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:40,310
anymore and you may still have that one

1090
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:43,210
for key - and you don't know for sure

1091
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:45,410
that it's going to go that direction so

1092
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:51,890
those are some of the concerns here

1093
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:57,009
about you know why do this at the same

1094
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:59,720
time if you a lot of this relies on

1095
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,400
operational procedures about how you

1096
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,919
manage your keys right because in theory

1097
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,130
of course if you have multiple keys and

1098
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,079
they can all revoke each other then you

1099
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:12,829
just need to have you know own one of

1100
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:16,069
these keys to wreak havoc and clearly

1101
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:18,410
that that can introduce you know bigger

1102
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:20,180
security risks so I think there's a

1103
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,799
trade-off here and you know I'm not sure

1104
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,359
that I have only all the answers but I'm

1105
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,730
hoping that the use of hsn's will

1106
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,500
actually help in this regard and strong

1107
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:30,349
processes but I don't think having this

1108
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:32,630
is enough you need you need to have all

1109
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:35,030
kinds of our know especially processors

1110
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:36,380
I think your your slide sparked my

1111
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:39,829
thought because you mentioned just now

1112
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:43,760
that you didn't want to revoke key one

1113
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:45,440
with keep with package two and three so

1114
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,020
that made me think about this so if you

1115
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,260
don't want like the newest key to revoke

1116
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:53,720
then maybe it doesn't have to be able to

1117
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:59,000
or well so you think about that kind of

1118
01:00:53,720 --> 01:01:00,770
property well if you referring to the

1119
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,310
one where I said only key to needs to

1120
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:06,230
revoke key one that was mainly because

1121
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:10,310
you and only need to learn about key

1122
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:12,050
ones revocation ones and so that was an

1123
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,880
attempt to stop you know the object from

1124
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:16,069
becoming really huge if you you know

1125
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,310
theoretically to do dozens of these

1126
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:18,310
roles

1127
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:25,250
last two questions then we'll lose the

1128
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:28,160
next sandy Murphy Parsons I'm standing

1129
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:30,680
at the far mic because I'm asking a

1130
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:34,240
question from a position of ignorance

1131
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:36,680
and in case you want to throw things I

1132
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,899
have been impressed at the amount of

1133
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,660
effort it took to do the DNS SEC key

1134
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,880
role so this is a really good idea to

1135
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,848
get an early start on considering here

1136
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,780
and so thank you very much for starting

1137
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:52,099
the work I also remember the

1138
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:55,660
difficulties that there was in the site

1139
01:01:52,099 --> 01:02:00,640
of working group to define the algorithm

1140
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:03,920
change documents from very long ago so

1141
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:20,118
what happens if your key role is also an

1142
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:23,510
algorithm role I don't know okay Boston

1143
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:24,680
orcas again um I haven't reread this

1144
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,240
recently so I don't know if you've

1145
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,009
already covered it - my apologies but

1146
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,419
one of the things that was a

1147
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:32,000
consideration that they're already

1148
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:33,319
taking a little bit of speaking from

1149
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,700
what I think Mike st. John's was

1150
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:39,940
intending with the RC 5011 for DNS SEC

1151
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:42,589
was the ability to pre publish keys

1152
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:46,609
before really using them and that's

1153
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:48,230
basically because no one really knows

1154
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:50,270
how to do an emergency key role an

1155
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:52,520
emergency key role for real and

1156
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,809
unplanned one he's basically burned it

1157
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:57,319
to the ground and start over which kind

1158
01:02:53,809 --> 01:03:00,160
of sucks so what you do instead is an

1159
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:02,480
accelerated schedule planned key role

1160
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,460
which kind of requires you get the the

1161
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:09,290
four to work well you need to get the

1162
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:10,579
next key out there early part the reason

1163
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:12,500
I bringing this up now is the question

1164
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:14,299
about whether or not there really should

1165
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,460
be some ordering in these keys so that

1166
01:03:14,299 --> 01:03:18,290
you can't have you know the older one

1167
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,280
revoke the new one we probably want to

1168
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,750
put that into the bucket while we're

1169
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,920
thinking this through I think they're

1170
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:28,210
all good questions I'm just not sure

1171
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,210
what the answer is yet fair enough

1172
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:37,050
all right thank you very much next up is

1173
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:37,530
mr. Bush let's see right away didn't run

1174
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:43,380
away

1175
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:45,210
ha ha you tell me which one would you

1176
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:50,040
like to do that one or that one don't

1177
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:53,250
care whatever comes up you know what you

1178
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:56,040
got the old yep with the wrong tiny ones

1179
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:59,370
right foil on Jesus I want a refund

1180
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:09,060
god damn pardon my french

1181
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:14,690
all right okay good we had a

1182
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:21,299
presentation look Ike okay better yes

1183
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:22,290
okay so as was kind of mentioned in a

1184
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,520
previous talk

1185
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:28,440
there was RFC 1897 with an extended

1186
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,420
community for origin validation

1187
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:35,100
signaling it kind of looked like this

1188
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:39,120
and how does the receiver drop in

1189
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:41,970
balance yeah I got the message I gave

1190
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,810
you a prefix you wrote back and you said

1191
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:48,450
it sucked

1192
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:52,140
what do I do cry okay so I want to drop

1193
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:56,520
in balance as if I had detected it

1194
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:59,640
myself running origin validation okay

1195
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:02,670
that should be the effect kind of in

1196
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:05,940
fact even slightly more strongly

1197
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:09,410
I should withdraw all the announcements

1198
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:11,750
where I actually sent out the garbage

1199
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:14,970
right

1200
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:18,270
so think about reflector with lazy

1201
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:21,930
clients the clients don't run origin

1202
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:25,710
validation but it would be nice if they

1203
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:28,770
understood this community and actually

1204
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:32,340
knew how to act on it and this isn't

1205
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:36,450
policy this is actual behavior change

1206
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:40,520
I'm getting a scowl from John and that's

1207
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:43,279
why because it sounds like work

1208
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:49,190
okay I mean it's not just the route

1209
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:51,530
reflect your situation but here in this

1210
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:55,990
draft we specifically talked about trust

1211
01:05:51,530 --> 01:06:00,650
boundary okay it's only within a pop

1212
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:04,459
it's not outsourcing it okay do not

1213
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:10,550
share your needles with customers or

1214
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:17,480
friends okay so here's where we kind of

1215
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:22,610
differ with the route server issue okay

1216
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:26,119
no okay as well of origin validation

1217
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:27,860
ploys we really want to do something

1218
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:30,880
like this it would be a bit of an

1219
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:34,580
accelerator make it easy for some people

1220
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,350
let's set her okay and we'd like to

1221
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:39,380
request

1222
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:41,450
w/g adoption you also want an email to

1223
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:44,770
the listener will that do please email

1224
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:47,710
list because I will forget about now

1225
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:49,490
three to go to the next presentation

1226
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:53,859
because you just said so

1227
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:56,750
do you have questions before I better I

1228
01:06:53,859 --> 01:07:00,369
want to explain why I was scowling which

1229
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,369
wasn't the reason you said I don't think

1230
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:08,500
if I understood your summary slides

1231
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:11,900
correctly you're scowling because of

1232
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:13,550
withdraw the ones I already announced

1233
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:17,810
right that should be a natural

1234
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:21,170
consequence of a policy that says I'm

1235
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:23,779
not accepting this I don't know the

1236
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:29,210
problem is I'm about reflect your client

1237
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:31,790
yeah okay take me around yeah I accepted

1238
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:34,780
it yeah I pass it to the right reflector

1239
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:41,060
right throughout reflector says and

1240
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:44,600
sends the signal back to me to you yeah

1241
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:47,810
okay to me that's okay and I've already

1242
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,130
accepted Andrea now now I understand

1243
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:50,390
what you're asking for I don't think I

1244
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,619
like it but I'll think about it for a

1245
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:54,690
while

1246
01:07:51,619 --> 01:07:56,609
that's why that is why I thought that's

1247
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:59,640
what you were scowling at this is work

1248
01:07:56,609 --> 01:08:03,808
and slightly ugly work because it's not

1249
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:06,359
only bad announcement but it's all the

1250
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:12,270
other announcements of the same prefix

1251
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:15,450
with the same origin right yep

1252
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:19,580
job Snyder's entity so you're kind of

1253
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:25,620
sticking bgp withdrawals for off link

1254
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:28,350
pierce into a BGP quincy no because what

1255
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:30,358
the route reflector so the reflector

1256
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:33,060
decides this is invalid it sends a

1257
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:34,859
signal back to the spoke that could be I

1258
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:39,089
know a well-known community or new

1259
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:42,929
attributes the spokes that the community

1260
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:44,399
it's already documented and find but

1261
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:48,120
you're saying that this mine takes word

1262
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,879
completes what it received from the ebgp

1263
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:53,519
peer as a withdrawal and then it will

1264
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,940
send with trust to know the other route

1265
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,940
service

1266
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:58,769
no no about some baby care can see the

1267
01:08:56,939 --> 01:09:00,629
route reflector when it receives routes

1268
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:02,969
from its clients will run a best spot

1269
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:05,640
and will announce the best spot a best

1270
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:07,799
spot when it does the community tags on

1271
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:11,790
top of it to say what is wrong with it

1272
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:14,250
now the route reflector could say part

1273
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:17,189
one is the best but part four that I

1274
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:19,439
just received had a bad community so it

1275
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:20,580
could do ad parts in piggyback part four

1276
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,528
and say this is wrong

1277
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:24,390
take it back which will be the net

1278
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:26,009
result will be same but it could also

1279
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,810
send it on the path one which was the

1280
01:09:26,009 --> 01:09:35,488
best part that is what Ryan is trying to

1281
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:37,980
say I think the spoke receives the

1282
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:42,000
signal then what does it do it should

1283
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:44,309
perform origin validation know that the

1284
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,948
point is when the spoke receives the

1285
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:54,120
signal it withdraws it drops the invalid

1286
01:09:49,948 --> 01:09:58,530
as if it had detected it but it has no

1287
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:02,519
cash feeding it so hands redraw any

1288
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:05,250
announcement it may have made with that

1289
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,280
invalid origin

1290
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:13,080
in other words this is signaling

1291
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:17,509
withdrawals over EGP communities since

1292
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,510
its signalling asking you to withdraw

1293
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:24,960
shared watch Akamai and and then it

1294
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:26,550
decides oh I might have seen this again

1295
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,050
because somebody did soft reconfigure

1296
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:30,180
route refresh and now I'm gonna send it

1297
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,130
back up and loop it loop it and create a

1298
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:34,400
message loop this this sounds

1299
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:38,670
potentially very scary and messy

1300
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:40,379
actually what Randy is trying to say and

1301
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:43,770
I'm channeling him so keep me honest

1302
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:46,310
when it receives an extended when edge

1303
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:49,560
router receives an extended community

1304
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:54,030
for that given prefix on an edge router

1305
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:56,760
for all the paths it will go and loop

1306
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:59,550
and say wherever you find a spot which

1307
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:02,460
is incorrect mark that path

1308
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:05,070
ineligible for best path reading the

1309
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:07,470
best path and then announced that new

1310
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:09,840
best path back to the route reflector so

1311
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:12,960
that if someone does a router refresh in

1312
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:17,120
again you always always send out the

1313
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,120
right path does that make sense

1314
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:23,339
maybe I I have ten minutes for two

1315
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:27,960
presentations gentlemen yep yeah which

1316
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:31,880
means none and it may yeah I could see

1317
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,880
this getting very messy you very quick I

1318
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:39,930
had a second question if we're gonna

1319
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:44,160
modify the edges to accommodate the

1320
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:46,440
behavior why not just implement region

1321
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,599
validation and I don't mean to be cocky

1322
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,870
but no no no that's perfectly valid

1323
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:54,540
that's my personal instinct of course

1324
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:58,610
but there are others who said otherwise

1325
01:11:54,540 --> 01:12:01,980
they want to have more centralized

1326
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:04,710
control at that level just as they have

1327
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:07,110
single or you know paired validators in

1328
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:08,880
a pop Ruettiger I'm sorry to be rude I

1329
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:12,380
have another present day how am i doing

1330
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:17,930
for time for the second presentation

1331
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:17,930
can we move along please sorry gentlemen

1332
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:28,139
that's the next button pluck the magic

1333
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,140
Twitter okay

1334
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:36,969
update the content on the thingy the

1335
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,960
meeting materials are correct this just

1336
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:44,050
is wrong but it's only the tie seeing is

1337
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,480
that yeah yeah I sent him the email on

1338
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:48,670
this than you asked for this says

1339
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,190
signaling what this says egress so

1340
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:58,920
that's just a very funny spelling of

1341
01:12:51,190 --> 01:13:03,160
egress ignored this is incited by

1342
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:07,480
professor Volk so the problem is the

1343
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:11,590
origin AAS may be modified by outbound

1344
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:18,129
policy and also note that the origin is

1345
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:22,840
is know when it's preparing to be

1346
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:26,500
announced okay so it will definitely be

1347
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:32,830
modified by outbound policy for if it's

1348
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:36,820
being originated here okay so we want

1349
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:41,559
policy semantics based on validation

1350
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:44,620
should be applied separately to

1351
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:47,500
distribution into bgp which if we've

1352
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:56,370
already defined and kind of have running

1353
01:13:47,500 --> 01:14:01,390
and separately to egress because I can

1354
01:13:56,370 --> 01:14:05,620
lunge the path change the effect of

1355
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:07,990
origin I could have a selection of a SS

1356
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:13,030
on this router and I'm the originator

1357
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:17,260
and then I choose which one of I'm gonna

1358
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:20,980
tag etc so I want to be able to apply

1359
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:24,760
origin validation to what I am about to

1360
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:27,370
announce because I don't want to hear

1361
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:29,760
from warrants knock well I've got bad

1362
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,760
breath

1363
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:40,610
so when applied aggress the effective

1364
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:43,430
origin is the note that's the effective

1365
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:49,610
or geneious must be used to determine

1366
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:51,080
the origin validation state and yes I

1367
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:54,889
will send you an email to request

1368
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:55,960
adoption thank you very much no extra

1369
01:14:54,890 --> 01:15:13,640
charge

1370
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:15,140
Mike go on I will mr. mandersohn so I

1371
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:19,790
don't have a fun slide for you so I'll

1372
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:23,420
just go back to the schedule slide thank

1373
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:26,720
you for your um your time so my name is

1374
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:28,400
Terry I'm a route server operator I'll

1375
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,370
be very clear that I only speak for

1376
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:33,589
myself as a root server operator and for

1377
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:34,820
the root server that I operate I will

1378
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:40,540
not speak for any other root server

1379
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:43,009
operator I want to draw your attention

1380
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,510
I'm talking about DNS and there's a

1381
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,910
reason I'm talking about DNS I'll get to

1382
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:56,660
it in a minute

1383
01:15:45,910 --> 01:16:00,950
yes yes route not route so there's a lot

1384
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:02,900
of a lot of push to do rpki because you

1385
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:04,880
know you'll look better you'll you'll

1386
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,410
grow your hair back and you know you'll

1387
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,790
be more attractive to the opposite sex

1388
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:10,760
all those sorts of things and that's

1389
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:11,720
fantastic there are two documents I

1390
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,820
would like to draw your attention to

1391
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,700
just slightly you may not understand

1392
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:18,410
where they come from but you can google

1393
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:23,630
them and find them there's something

1394
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:26,660
called Rs sac 0:21 are a sec is the root

1395
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:29,270
server system Advisory Committee and our

1396
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:31,670
sector a21 essentially says that the

1397
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:33,800
failure of one root server operator is

1398
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:37,280
not critical to the operation of the

1399
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:41,780
entire internet and that's good there's

1400
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:44,040
a second document our sex 0 for 2 which

1401
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:47,009
says

1402
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,860
things about the independence of root

1403
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:52,290
cellar operators and one of those things

1404
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:55,049
that it discusses is that root server

1405
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:57,300
operators will be diverse in their

1406
01:16:55,050 --> 01:17:02,160
operations and their network operations

1407
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:04,500
and infrastructures so now I think about

1408
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,900
this and this is my perspective only no

1409
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:10,200
one else's someone might share it but

1410
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:14,030
this is my observation is that if the

1411
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:18,000
root server operators all do rpki

1412
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:22,290
they are then impacted should one of the

1413
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:27,870
five TAS have an a situation more so

1414
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:31,680
right now if one particular operator ta

1415
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:36,050
operator rpki operator has an issue it

1416
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:44,880
will affect nine root server operators

1417
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:47,160
discuss iottery there's a flaw in to

1418
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,450
seeing them also root so operator and I

1419
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:52,980
learned about this about five minutes

1420
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:55,470
ago so what I figured out with the and

1421
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:58,379
Natalie sand Roberts help from the NCC

1422
01:17:55,470 --> 01:18:00,690
is it turns out even if you're not doing

1423
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:06,030
our PK if you don't have an Aurora you

1424
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:12,929
still have a problem because someone can

1425
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:16,710
get Aurora then Madison what come on um

1426
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:18,090
I presume the the single ta operator

1427
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:20,580
that you refer to is Erin and that's

1428
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:22,110
because that's where most of the it

1429
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:26,010
doesn't matter who it is it's arbitrary

1430
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:28,019
well whether there's there's 12

1431
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:31,200
organizations that operate root servers

1432
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:32,340
there's only five organizations that

1433
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,470
currently do the in this current model

1434
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,570
like I'm not trying to propose any

1435
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:38,820
solutions that's not my job my job is

1436
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:40,230
just to highlight that I see there that

1437
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:42,840
there is a diversity issue

1438
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:44,839
I was asking to make sure I was

1439
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,880
understanding the problem as you said

1440
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:50,370
this is presumably exacerbated by the

1441
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:53,310
fact that all five acclaiming root in

1442
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:55,710
their roots yeas of no not necessarily

1443
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:58,020
it would actually also exist if there

1444
01:18:55,710 --> 01:19:05,580
was a single trust anchor

1445
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:09,840
and it could be worse but it's still so

1446
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:13,620
you don't see this being improved from a

1447
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:16,500
diversity perspective by having the the

1448
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:20,220
numbers from which the root servers come

1449
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:23,160
from more widely spreading right amongst

1450
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:26,670
this so evenly distributed I don't see

1451
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:34,200
it as a as a it's better but it's not

1452
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:37,800
ideal in in my opinion again this is all

1453
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:43,710
my opinion my observations job Snyder's

1454
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:45,930
NCT I have trouble grasping the problem

1455
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:51,510
there are five root certificates and

1456
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:55,710
there are 1326 prefixes and you can

1457
01:19:51,510 --> 01:20:00,180
distribute the 2605 tells and that's not

1458
01:19:55,710 --> 01:20:02,310
enough diversity can you do the numbers

1459
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:04,400
for your first two are sac documents

1460
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:04,400
please

1461
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:09,930
0:21 sorry know about those numbers the

1462
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,940
the internal numbers like the first one

1463
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:14,130
was it's okay if one root server is

1464
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:17,040
disappeared yeah and the second one is

1465
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:20,850
the the the first one is it one it's

1466
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:25,250
okay if there is one one roots of

1467
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:29,130
operator fails the second one is a

1468
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:33,180
principal that's set for the operation

1469
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:34,740
of root server operators and that is

1470
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:37,530
that root server operators will have

1471
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:42,300
diversity in their operations inclusive

1472
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:45,150
of network and stuff like that so if you

1473
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:47,730
sign half of them not sign the other

1474
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:51,660
half and distribute amongst multiple r

1475
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:54,509
ers you're done right I don't know is

1476
01:20:51,660 --> 01:21:01,320
that the answer that that cider ups

1477
01:20:54,510 --> 01:21:06,309
would recommend is that within our men

1478
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:09,639
days you upper this is

1479
01:21:06,309 --> 01:21:12,849
where you operate rpki and cider and

1480
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:15,670
stuff this is where your expertise is

1481
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:18,010
that's not my expertise in that case I

1482
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:20,730
would recommend you try to transfer at

1483
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:23,440
least one ipv6 prefix to another region

1484
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:30,808
as an experiment to see if you can

1485
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:30,808
obtain access to other certificates Oh

1486
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:36,489
my name is Carlos I work for Lange Nick

1487
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:39,369
notify or else we would happily welcome

1488
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:43,030
you guys I mean we can recover policies

1489
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:44,920
that allow us to assign prefixes for

1490
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:47,050
critical infrastructure that can be used

1491
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:50,289
outside of our region and I believe the

1492
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:52,840
other four have similar policies my my

1493
01:21:50,289 --> 01:21:54,670
comment is that I don't think that's a

1494
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:58,270
problem for us to solve I mean as cider

1495
01:21:54,670 --> 01:22:03,309
ups I think if you have nine prefixes

1496
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:06,369
within a single IRR you guys are a bit

1497
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:08,349
weak on the diversity aspect that you

1498
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:10,900
apparently are defending and other

1499
01:22:08,349 --> 01:22:13,840
documents I don't know what the solution

1500
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:15,730
is I mean you could roll a piece in some

1501
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,530
of the root servers distributed among

1502
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,869
their areas you could get a new space

1503
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:22,059
from us you could transfer like yourself

1504
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:25,119
there are a bunch of ways you could

1505
01:22:22,059 --> 01:22:26,829
actually create more diversity in that

1506
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:29,619
aspect of their roots or reparations

1507
01:22:26,829 --> 01:22:33,369
maybe someone should like write a

1508
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:39,058
document that defines some things that

1509
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:42,699
you should do but that is no there is no

1510
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:45,250
advice about this to date you know I

1511
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:47,650
have my statement for a plane to our

1512
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:49,119
site in my computer I've had it for a

1513
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:51,670
while I think I've this is the right

1514
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,710
time to submit maybe it is Terry can I

1515
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:54,159
ask another clarifying question she can

1516
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:56,079
okay

1517
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:59,138
it sounds to me like you're using the

1518
01:22:56,079 --> 01:23:00,820
root servers as an example organization

1519
01:22:59,139 --> 01:23:01,360
and losing the weight serve as an

1520
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,849
example

1521
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,769
okay sorry you're using your root I have

1522
01:23:03,849 --> 01:23:08,170
a problem okay okay I have people

1523
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:11,110
telling me that I need to do a PK oh I

1524
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:12,820
am nervous as heck a baby doing it

1525
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:17,699
because I don't want to end up on the

1526
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:17,699
front of Time magazine too late so

1527
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:28,770
they don't make a magazine anymore

1528
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:31,170
I think the depth I guess what I was

1529
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:32,250
trying to go is you there are some

1530
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:34,320
things that are sort of hot-button

1531
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:36,090
topics and maybe the issue is not

1532
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,860
necessarily a roots or a problem this is

1533
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:40,500
in general network operations problem if

1534
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,280
I operate something a large resource of

1535
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,690
the Internet or so you think that's

1536
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,610
interesting to me from a business

1537
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:47,450
perspective I have to have redundancy

1538
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:49,830
diversity you know failover sort of

1539
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:53,190
capability and my business continuity

1540
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:55,790
plan maybe didn't take into account that

1541
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:58,049
I have all of my resources in one rir I

1542
01:23:55,790 --> 01:24:00,269
wasn't making that point but if you want

1543
01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:02,220
to let up that that's fine okay always I

1544
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:05,010
was making a point simply for my own

1545
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:08,630
operations is selfish and lack of

1546
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:12,150
altruism as that is that's where it was

1547
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:14,640
okay there hi Robert Kiyosaki ripe ncc I

1548
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:19,889
am NOT a Rupert root operator I have

1549
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:22,850
friends who are three things first what

1550
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:25,740
Chris said in I don't think that root

1551
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:29,670
the root servers are any special in this

1552
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:31,050
context just a state yeah that's funny I

1553
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:34,080
don't like the idea of golden numbers

1554
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:36,320
and stuff as well six five second

1555
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:39,720
statement we went through the scenarios

1556
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:41,370
over lunch and I'm happy to talk to you

1557
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,290
or anyone who is interested or we can

1558
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:45,540
form some kind of committee whatever um

1559
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:50,820
but the end result of the discussion was

1560
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:55,430
that no operator can be worse off than

1561
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:58,349
today if they also have Roseanne rpki

1562
01:24:55,430 --> 01:25:01,470
they may be better off but they will not

1563
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:03,930
be worse off in case of attacks and so

1564
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:08,490
on okay it's not just every day but if

1565
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:11,610
 hits the fan I'm happy to talk

1566
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:14,370
about it as I said the third statement

1567
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:18,170
is that it's a bit tongue-in-cheek but

1568
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:21,030
brute operators already synchronize on

1569
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:24,240
protocols and everything they do you all

1570
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:26,160
run ipv4 ipv6 bgp blah blah blah so you

1571
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,750
might want to you know if you want to

1572
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,970
diversify then you might want to do

1573
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:35,550
write P X or something yeah

1574
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:37,050
it's pretty much tongue in cheek Doug

1575
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:39,470
McDermott just to be clear so you're

1576
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:42,870
afraid of either accidental or malicious

1577
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:46,230
Roiz being created that caused other

1578
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:48,750
folk to drop your route or it could be

1579
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:50,580
anything I'm trying to understand the

1580
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:52,050
threat scenario which doesn't cause all

1581
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:54,330
right I'll look I understand that it

1582
01:25:52,050 --> 01:26:01,220
could be an operational failure at the

1583
01:25:54,330 --> 01:26:03,600
entity that is signing so which

1584
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:08,490
resources to become unknown it would

1585
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:12,630
become invalid if it becomes invalid

1586
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:16,490
then people who are filtering invalid

1587
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:16,490
can't reach you on that address correct

1588
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:21,930
especially if they but that the people

1589
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:25,889
who are filtering or transit and all of

1590
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:36,410
their customers can't reach good slurm

1591
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:39,270
value first for everybody else

1592
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:44,269
suggestions did involve a route server

1593
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:55,230
changing its IP address our fir after

1594
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:58,440
I'm dead the protocol if you get far

1595
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:59,480
build I don't care they're twelve other

1596
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:06,299
Road servers

1597
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:12,000
um so doing drastic structural action in

1598
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:16,800
the rpki or the protocol is doesn't get

1599
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,660
a lot of sympathy thirdly is I would

1600
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,570
refer you to about a three year old

1601
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:28,400
presentation that shows you how to

1602
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:28,400
escape Aaron all my resources are ripe

1603
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:39,900
all my v4 and v6 are in right oh not

1604
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:41,820
maybe six cuz it's not mine I didn't

1605
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:43,058
mean this to be a beat up on on any Aria

1606
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:45,579
that's not why

1607
01:27:43,059 --> 01:27:47,800
who you said you have a whole bunch of

1608
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:50,619
the rude operators are in one arm that's

1609
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,050
all it's a facet of history whatever was

1610
01:27:50,619 --> 01:27:56,619
the cause what I'm saying is some of

1611
01:27:53,050 --> 01:28:00,039
them could move without changing IP

1612
01:27:56,619 --> 01:28:02,889
addresses I think my key point is that

1613
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:04,929
even if we all moved and and shuffled

1614
01:28:02,889 --> 01:28:07,179
around it would be still people world

1615
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:09,340
organizations being compressed down into

1616
01:28:07,179 --> 01:28:22,770
five organizations so your diversity set

1617
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:26,679
is now five said being having Aurora is

1618
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:29,679
no worse than having no row and your

1619
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:32,020
response was incorrect when you said the

1620
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:34,869
folder of that role could far below an

1621
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:38,020
issue a bad AS IS the detail you're

1622
01:28:34,869 --> 01:28:40,179
worried about and they couldn't issue a

1623
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:46,719
role with a bad alias for you if you

1624
01:28:40,179 --> 01:28:48,250
hadn't registered Bravo Stein arkose two

1625
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,599
observations one

1626
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:51,579
you're not gonna settle this or get

1627
01:28:49,599 --> 01:28:53,320
career an advice today this is a little

1628
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:56,558
bit to do people I know I thought I'd

1629
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:58,210
raise it anyway other thing though I

1630
01:28:56,559 --> 01:29:00,880
think you need to make a distinction

1631
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:02,380
between reliability and availability and

1632
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:06,309
the two services you're talking about

1633
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:07,989
here the fetching and caching behavior

1634
01:29:06,309 --> 01:29:09,250
of DNS is very different from the

1635
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:09,989
fetching and caching behavior of the

1636
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:14,020
rpki

1637
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:16,509
you can probably survive an outage of no

1638
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:18,010
new stuff being published in the rpki

1639
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:19,510
for a while I mean eventually they'll

1640
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:21,699
start to have problems you know CR ELLs

1641
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:23,020
get stale bla bla bla bla bla but if

1642
01:29:21,699 --> 01:29:25,210
people aren't using stupidly short

1643
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:28,000
expiration times you can last a few days

1644
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:30,610
right a few days if a root server being

1645
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,739
out would probably be more noticeable so

1646
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:35,199
you may need to do the numbers on how

1647
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:37,780
long of an outage is acceptable that

1648
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:39,219
sort of thing and you know getting good

1649
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,809
observation yet excited the better

1650
01:29:39,219 --> 01:29:41,829
distribution but you know talked about

1651
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:44,039
it by five there's only so much you can

1652
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:44,039
do

1653
01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:49,960
Jeff Jeff Houston accidental player

1654
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,380
inside the ICANN circus from time to

1655
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,340
time

1656
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:57,250
look our sack exists for a very good

1657
01:29:54,340 --> 01:30:01,810
reason and part of that reason he

1658
01:29:57,250 --> 01:30:04,060
to observe understand and possibly

1659
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:06,640
recommend you've raised an interesting

1660
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:10,300
issue and part of the issue is whether

1661
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:12,760
you should sign and what the Associated

1662
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,010
sort of issues of diversity where the

1663
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,170
addresses get said it and so on and I

1664
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:19,120
think they're great topics and you

1665
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:23,230
should consider from the perspective of

1666
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:26,559
all 12 of you what you should do to give

1667
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:28,419
yourselves both diversity and maximal

1668
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,640
availability and performance and so on

1669
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:34,000
and that seems to me like something that

1670
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:36,340
our sac should investigate and harness

1671
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,290
resources and do study for maybe

1672
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:40,420
invoking expert commentary or whatever

1673
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:43,180
our sec wants to do i think it's

1674
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:45,340
difficult for this group to understand

1675
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:48,100
the particular needs of those 12

1676
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:51,880
operators or even just one in isolation

1677
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:54,220
and your motivation about diversity is

1678
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:57,690
perhaps best studied in detail in our

1679
01:30:54,220 --> 01:31:01,840
sac i'm saying in short not here not now

1680
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:04,509
guess where I'm going next and fight but

1681
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:08,320
wait I do want to go there and then all

1682
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:12,910
of a sudden you guys get sideswiped by a

1683
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:14,559
random question so I'm being polite in

1684
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:16,210
this situation right and I think the

1685
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,980
politeness is more than a sec might

1686
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:19,330
circle around either the group will one

1687
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,339
or two of the group and get some more

1688
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:22,930
data as they do their investigation and

1689
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:24,910
that's great and it's great that it's

1690
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:27,130
forewarning as I said it's a bit tough

1691
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:28,300
to say to us solve it because like I

1692
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:29,650
said wrong place wrong time

1693
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:31,300
I'm not ask you to solve it on actually

1694
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:34,450
think about it that's why I said discuss

1695
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:38,230
I didn't say so because I actually don't

1696
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:40,389
think it is solvable in in the sense of

1697
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,219
a protocol sensor that as Randy pointed

1698
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:44,200
out it would be a significant

1699
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:47,200
architectural change and I don't think

1700
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,450
that is rightly appropriate but other

1701
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,280
things can be done like many things

1702
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:53,320
about the root server system it's about

1703
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,120
assurance to the community that the you

1704
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:57,849
know we're doing as well as we can do

1705
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,710
state-of-the-art is there and you know I

1706
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:01,930
think our sac is perfectly capable of

1707
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:05,110
getting to that kind of advice without

1708
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:07,930
necessarily committing myself there

1709
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:10,530
doing any work at all just just a note

1710
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:11,999
on time we are over time so there

1711
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:15,478
whatever cookies are the next thing

1712
01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:18,659
coming with little markers just one

1713
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:20,880
general remark it's a common thing that

1714
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:25,018
the when you are implements are

1715
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:28,940
mechanism to cope the summer the attacks

1716
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:31,530
then you will have additional failures

1717
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:33,719
connected with a possible failure of

1718
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:38,869
that mechanism it's obvious you should

1719
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:42,179
leave that the problem is whether gains

1720
01:32:38,869 --> 01:32:45,119
from implementing that measure mechanism

1721
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:48,479
over weights where possible drawbacks

1722
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:52,018
from these mechanism being broken so you

1723
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:56,329
just brought the common general question

1724
01:32:52,019 --> 01:32:59,909
so who is it worth to implement

1725
01:32:56,329 --> 01:33:04,409
mechanism yeah just the drawbacks will

1726
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:11,339
alway to gains so so everyone should

1727
01:33:04,409 --> 01:33:14,308
decide by himself so duck again so it

1728
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:15,749
seems like your risk is the same no

1729
01:33:14,309 --> 01:33:17,460
matter what decision you take right

1730
01:33:15,749 --> 01:33:21,449
because it's the other people doing

1731
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:26,340
validation if if a CA is compromised and

1732
01:33:21,449 --> 01:33:29,280
somebody creates a a a wrong ro uh for

1733
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:36,150
your resources whether you take action

1734
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:37,409
or not I'm hoist correct right okay so

1735
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:40,879
it seems like you can make your decision

1736
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:44,249
as to whether you whether you fear Route

1737
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:47,090
hijacks to the routes routes route

1738
01:33:44,249 --> 01:33:51,329
hijacks to the routes more than you do

1739
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:54,199
you know compromised massive failure to

1740
01:33:51,329 --> 01:33:55,920
rpki in the way that would generate

1741
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:59,039
invalid somewhere else

1742
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:02,519
III think of I've done enough here of

1743
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:04,590
raised the awareness of it and then I

1744
01:34:02,519 --> 01:34:06,210
think the rest can be discussions I

1745
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:07,920
could be a perhaps because I think we're

1746
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:12,329
kind of out of time and cookies awaiting

1747
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:14,969
so what is what you would propose a

1748
01:34:12,329 --> 01:34:17,549
mechanism for follow up on this is there

1749
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:20,849
a working group that works on this or an

1750
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:23,479
action if we have a great idea where do

1751
01:34:20,849 --> 01:34:23,479
we send it I

1752
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:32,370
my next steps and one had already

1753
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,719
planned is to raise it at at our sect

1754
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:38,769
bit of information is that I am also a

1755
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:40,480
representative at our sac and I'm also a

1756
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:42,820
member of the asset caucus the asset

1757
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:46,660
caucus is the thing that does the work

1758
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:48,790
for our sac so it will be raised in our

1759
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:51,250
sac that may also spin off into other

1760
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:52,840
requests into other parts of the the I

1761
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,790
can't ecosystem including something

1762
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,730
called s SEC which I do know Jeff is

1763
01:34:54,790 --> 01:35:01,330
also a member of and some others here in

1764
01:34:57,730 --> 01:35:03,370
this room perhaps as well so yes there's

1765
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:05,530
additional stuff coming through and I

1766
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:08,590
think Jeff's right I think those groups

1767
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:11,590
will circle back here but I think it was

1768
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:15,760
good to just raise it and so you have

1769
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:19,510
some awareness of issues some

1770
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:24,400
operational issues that are caused by

1771
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:26,170
this particular corner case and as Chris

1772
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,820
pointed out possibly by other

1773
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:30,820
organizations who might think the same

1774
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:35,730
way are thank you so much I really

1775
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:35,730
appreciate it thanks very

1776
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:56,830
you
