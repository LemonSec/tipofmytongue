1
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,020
hi welcome to the t's working group at

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,239
IDF 105 I'm Luke Berger Kevon theorem

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,770
next to me and we are lucky enough to

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,750
have actually have Matt Hartley in the

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,040
room he's off at remote he really does

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,259
exist

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,418
we always appreciate his help whether

8
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:32,890
remote or local it's great to have him

9
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:37,090
here

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,620
our agenda has been posted there really

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,400
hasn't been any significant change

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,910
that's been posted we are doing etherpad

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,510
as usual I asked everyone to jump on and

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,129
help us capture comments that are made

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,010
at the mic you don't need to capture

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,900
everything that's spoken during they

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,780
hate the slides that's captured in the

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,010
slides and the videos and it's really

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,640
the discussion that's important to

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,770
capture in the notes we are at the IETF

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,640
you didn't notice which means we have

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,850
our note well we have rules that govern

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,370
our participation and our contribution

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,830
to the IETF if you're not familiar with

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,520
it please take a look at that URL on the

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:25,840
bottom but basically everything you say

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,640
here or at any meeting at the IETF it

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,610
becomes part of our record we're

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,640
streaming we're recording please say

30
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,470
your names as you come to the microphone

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,430
that's helpful for those who are remote

32
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:45,250
as well as for when you go back to take

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,740
make sure we have accurate minutes I am

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,119
on Jabbar and if anyone else wants to

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,649
jump on Jabbar that's great but

36
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,840
sometimes I don't always come on it

37
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,510
always able to monitor so well that's

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,250
chair but if anyone has a comment remote

39
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:01,439
we welcome that whether you come in

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,439
through me echo or through jabber

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,478
so moving on to where we are on

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:14,859
documents we have no new RFC's and we

43
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,790
just had one RFC that moved into the RFC

44
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:21,480
editor queue on yesterday

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,179
that's the to each apology that is a was

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,709
a very major piece of work it's

47
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,950
important piece of work and we're really

48
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:33,030
happy to see that progressing we have

49
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,488
some other documents that are being that

50
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,190
are going through the normal is cheap

51
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,019
processing and so it's always but again

52
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,420
to see the work of the working group

53
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,609
heading towards publication of course

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,640
that's why we're here we have a couple

55
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:54,239
of newly adopted documents I believe

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:56,670
they are both on the agenda okay we'll

57
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,000
go through in a moment any document

58
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,700
that's not on the agenda we have two

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,709
sessions today the first ones one year

60
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,149
and now so good you found us that's

61
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,409
excellent

62
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,459
the session information changes between

63
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:16,980
the sessions in particular the audio

64
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,959
stream will change there everything else

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,409
stays the same including thankfully the

66
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,049
room

67
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:25,649
we do have a beverage break for 20

68
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:29,129
minutes between 3 and 3:20 we do intend

69
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,440
to take that break it is our hope that

70
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,849
we can run through our agenda faster

71
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,099
than what we have listed but we also do

72
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,619
have this extra long time the ex is

73
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,480
actually more time than we requested so

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,069
we'll take advantage of it we don't have

75
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,590
to leave early but if we leave early

76
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:51,708
that's also okay our agenda is pretty

77
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,709
tight particularly the first session

78
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,569
this is loaded with documents that are

79
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,780
have been accepted by the working group

80
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,280
as well as the designs in activity that

81
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,810
we talked about I believe that the last

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,049
meeting or talked about last couple of

83
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:13,409
meetings our second session we'll move

84
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:15,260
on to non adopted work and particular we

85
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:19,048
have a little bit of a section on

86
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,089
slicing and 5-g related activities that

87
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,799
I'm sure lots of folks will be

88
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:28,380
interested in and that's that lay a hot

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:31,500
topic we've had no liaisons or

90
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,420
communication since the last meeting I

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,700
just realized I meant to go and check

92
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,860
Arata I'm not sure if we had any errata

93
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,750
that came in but we should mention that

94
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,120
that's my bad

95
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,820
Pavan says we didn't have any so that's

96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,100
didn't miss anything here that's good as

97
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,770
usual just a reminder we have a formal

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,350
IPR process that we've adopted in the

99
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,870
working group that says we will hold a

100
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:59,300
working group

101
00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:02,580
whenever we adopt a document and again

102
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,320
before we submit for publications but

103
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,740
the IceCube location will pull the

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,740
working group to for disclosures of IPR

105
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,050
we do encourage everyone to use the

106
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,880
mailing list it's a great place for

107
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,430
discussion it's a great place to make

108
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,570
sure that your colleagues are in sync

109
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,370
with the activity that the progress

110
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,219
you've been making on a draft and it's a

111
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,810
great way to report those private

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,510
conversations that happen inevitably

113
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:50,610
happen between authors and that's it for

114
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:54,710
the first so much for the idea of

115
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,710
reloading loading everything up to start

116
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:20,599
we look at the status of working group

117
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:22,280
documents now this is the set of

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,780
documents working group documents that

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,760
are not in the agenda today so we'll

120
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,969
walk through the status of each of these

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,150
in the next few slides first up is the

122
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,360
AC TN yang document no changes since the

123
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,270
last ITF in previous meetings we agreed

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,220
that we would wait for the generate key

125
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,409
models to progress to the publication

126
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,300
stage and then revisit this we are not

127
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,710
there yet so in the meantime if we can

128
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,979
get in a few more reviews that would be

129
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:51,919
very useful

130
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,990
next is the enhanced VPN document there

131
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,450
was a revision published for this early

132
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,280
this month there was a section added for

133
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,610
covering inter domain and inter layer

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,739
network scenarios the authors intend to

135
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,530
add more details and operational

136
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,630
considerations we do have some work

137
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,179
relevant to this coming up in the second

138
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,690
session so this topic would get

139
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,900
revisited again

140
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,250
next is the PC native IP document there

141
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,650
was a revision published for this in

142
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,050
April this carried primarily some a

143
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,090
tutorial changes the authors may make a

144
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,830
few changes to the document based on how

145
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,950
the scenarios document progresses

146
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:34,310
through the publication stage there is

147
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,830
there was an open question on if and

148
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,320
when the status of this needs to be

149
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,530
changed so we would let it stay as is

150
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,770
for now and revisited at a later point

151
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,770
in time

152
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,539
next is the PC CC use cases document

153
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:53,479
there was a revision published for this

154
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,370
in July there was some text added to

155
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,620
state that this is a living document to

156
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,870
catalog the various use case of PC CC

157
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,479
and that there is currently no intent

158
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,060
from the authors to publish this as an

159
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,460
RSC this point of debate would be

160
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,760
revisited at a later point in time when

161
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:15,380
I guess we run out of more any more use

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,659
cases to add the if the last revision

163
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,110
date contain

164
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,300
a new section for beer the PCE CC use

165
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,810
case for beer and the author's do intend

166
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:31,270
to add cover the multicast SR policy use

167
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:33,669
case as well in upcoming provisions this

168
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,699
is the RSVP RM our extensions draft

169
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:40,478
there was a section added in the new

170
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,070
revision covering Express links at this

171
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,870
point they are requesting the authors

172
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,190
are requesting further review and

173
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,560
feedback from the working group so

174
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,029
please do give it a read and reach out

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,279
to the authors on the list if you have

176
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:55,839
any questions or concerns with approach

177
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:59,079
being taken next is the SF aware

178
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,209
topology model there haven't been any

179
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,660
changes to this since the last ITF but

180
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:06,939
the authors do feel that it it's mature

181
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,089
enough to warrant a young doctor to take

182
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,959
a look at it so we'll make sure that

183
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:17,829
happens next is the long-standing key

184
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:20,109
metric recording craft at this stage

185
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,170
last year we were on the verge of

186
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,490
killing this but the authors of

187
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,390
miraculously turned this around they did

188
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,579
publish a revision yesterday and asked

189
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,370
for the authors there are no more open

190
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,930
issues and they are ready to take it to

191
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,940
the last call I did skim through the

192
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,439
document then seems like all the

193
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,149
outstanding comments have been addressed

194
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,769
I would request the working group to do

195
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,269
the same and reach out to the authors if

196
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,220
there are still any concerns we do

197
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:50,199
intend to take it to the list pretty

198
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:54,370
soon next is the tea service mapping

199
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:57,609
document again only no changes since the

200
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:00,399
last time but there are a few

201
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,829
outstanding items from early this year

202
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
that need to get a dust the authors have

203
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:09,430
promised that this would be taken care

204
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,649
of in that coming revisions next is the

205
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,920
tutorial document that we have for using

206
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:17,880
the tea topology and towel modeling

207
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,729
tunnel models this again falls under

208
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,380
sort of a living document bucket there

209
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,079
is currently no urgency to take it to

210
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,819
the next stage the authors do have I

211
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,120
have identified they have identified a

212
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:30,120
few

213
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,499
or scenarios to cover so please do

214
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,550
review them as they come and reach out

215
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:38,379
to the others if there are any

216
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,649
particular scenarios that aren't

217
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:44,439
currently available in the document the

218
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:48,579
last document in this deck is the path

219
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:51,219
computation data model there they were a

220
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:55,479
few this seems to be an outdated slight

221
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,189
but yeah there were some comments that

222
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,839
were received on the list from I believe

223
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:03,790
Olivia and Julian they were a couple of

224
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,279
use cases that are added but those did

225
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,939
not translate into any young model

226
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,470
changes the authors do have a few open

227
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,309
issues on the gate that need to get

228
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,370
taken care of and they do believe that

229
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:20,769
this would be ready for a young dog

230
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,480
distributive or the next idea that's all

231
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:27,160
we have in this deck let's move on to

232
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,550
our first present of other day that

233
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,550
would be correct

234
00:11:39,830 --> 00:12:00,810
just say good afternoon the working

235
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,480
group my name is tarick

236
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,959
and I'll walk you over a quick update

237
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:12,810
over the working group documents on the

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:15,690
first slide so I'll go over the updates

239
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,719
from the last time we met I'll present

240
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:22,890
some open issues and finally we'll talk

241
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,770
about the next steps X piece so the

242
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:30,060
first document is the yang - te which

243
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:33,030
covers the tunnels LSPs constructs and

244
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,520
attributes that model on the device as

245
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:39,260
well as on off the device or a

246
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,439
controller next please

247
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,689
so the first open issue the this this

248
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,750
model or this document went through a

249
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:51,650
round of yang doctor's review and we got

250
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,290
recently comments the author's will be

251
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:57,530
going ahead and the first feedback we

252
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,209
got this is on the right track and and

253
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:06,150
we will be addressing the cons that we

254
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:07,770
got next these the second open issue is

255
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,709
a discussion that happened on the

256
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,829
mailing list and with regards to a

257
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,410
tunnel name collision tunnels can be

258
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,660
configured on the device they could be

259
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,360
configured on the controller they could

260
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:26,120
be learned or State on the controller or

261
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,120
learnt or State on the device itself and

262
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,579
we have we have an issue where the name

263
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,530
of a tunnel that is learned can collide

264
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,800
with a tunnel that's configured either

265
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,540
on the device or the controller and we

266
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,370
have a proposal that we discussed on the

267
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,949
list as I mentioned and we'll go over it

268
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:49,170
on the next slide please so as I was

269
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,660
mentioning the name collision can happen

270
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,469
on the controller if the controller

271
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,630
learns of

272
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,930
from different devices with the same

273
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,910
name what we had suggested is for

274
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:03,089
learned tunnels or four state tunnels

275
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:06,329
from devices we will append the ingress

276
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:09,870
ID to the name so that it's unique so an

277
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,840
example is a tunnel r1 - foo will be

278
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:17,040
distinguishable from r2 - foo where r1

279
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,560
and r2 are the ingress routers the

280
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,930
second case an operator can configure a

281
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,869
tunnel name matching and automatically

282
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:27,680
create a tunnel on the device with the

283
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,810
same name we have to have them

284
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,189
distinguishable so we are proposing a

285
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:40,260
configured prefix the prefix can take

286
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:42,690
for example Auto as value or string and

287
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,960
then we can distinguish for example a

288
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,450
tunnel auto - bypass link one from a

289
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,570
tunnel bypass - link 1 which is

290
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:56,090
configured so the one on auto - is

291
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:59,610
auto-created and the bypass - link 1 is

292
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,320
configured by the operator so this is

293
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,990
this is one way we could distinguish it

294
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,720
in the in this case the third case is a

295
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,260
controller has a configured tunnel with

296
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,290
a name and then it learns a tunnel with

297
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:17,040
the same name and what we're suggesting

298
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,660
is we have penned the prefix the same

299
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,939
prefix we are introducing can be

300
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,839
configured with a different value on the

301
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,200
controller for example remote so in this

302
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:32,010
example on the bottom I show in remote -

303
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,640
r1 foo remote - r2 foo will be the

304
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,010
distinguished from r2 - foo for example

305
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,439
which is configured on the controller so

306
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,110
the gist of the proposal is that we have

307
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,080
a prefix and we prepend the name with it

308
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,260
so it becomes distinguishable next

309
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,260
please

310
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:58,470
the next draft is the RSVP model draft

311
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:00,930
we have two modules in it the model

312
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,540
covers the attributes of the RSVP

313
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,939
protocol and signaling parameters per

314
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,709
session per neighbor and per interface

315
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:12,179
next please so for this draft it went

316
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:15,358
through a round of doctor's review

317
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,759
comments and we got the feedback and

318
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,579
addressed it so we had some knits to

319
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,339
address added nets we had state

320
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,728
containers which was in conflict with

321
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:30,539
nmda and we removed that we had to

322
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:33,689
expand some names of Leafs some

323
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:35,999
pluralization of nouns there as well

324
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:41,069
we added some normative references for

325
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:45,419
imported mod modules next the second

326
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:49,439
update the four four sessions of RSVP we

327
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:52,379
had a single list and we were putting in

328
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:55,799
this list two types of sessions IP RSVP

329
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:58,409
sessions and rsvp-te sessions the key of

330
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:04,138
these two sessions as defined into RFC

331
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:07,109
2205 and 3209 they're different P so one

332
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:09,508
suggestion was for the ease of lookup of

333
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,579
a section a session to use the actual

334
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:15,599
real key native key that rather than

335
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:19,259
having a index that we needed to a walk

336
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,658
to match on the specific session so we

337
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,689
the proposal what we've done is we split

338
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:27,809
into two lists one list for RSVP IP

339
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:31,049
sessions another list for our zbt

340
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:44,220
sessions and we introduced the native

341
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:46,529
keys for each type of session next did

342
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:51,809
you include support for the upset cars

343
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:56,789
PPP RSVP types the desk or the security

344
00:17:51,809 --> 00:18:03,870
the IP security yeah this was - - oh I

345
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:10,009
admit doesn't ring no okay are you

346
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:13,110
hinting that we should or okay whether

347
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:15,299
whether or not this actually supports it

348
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,830
I think you might be okay for the

349
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,049
session that the center template might

350
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,850
cause you a problem okay

351
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:26,759
it's worth double check I will double

352
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:29,549
check thank you so we added a couple of

353
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:32,309
our pcs with our GP model specifically

354
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:35,759
to clear sessions specific session or

355
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:39,178
all of the sessions and the clear RSVP

356
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,559
neighbor we have a hello session

357
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,230
established with that neighbor and we

358
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,230
wanted to clear it again it's a specific

359
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,009
session or all of the sessions the

360
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,320
notifications we piggybacked on the

361
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:55,470
publish/subscribe model and we added a

362
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,139
section and draft to talk how we can

363
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:03,059
leverage that

364
00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:06,928
max please with with this the next steps

365
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:09,619
we for the first draft we've addressed

366
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:12,239
all of the yang doctors review comments

367
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:14,039
there we go with another round of

368
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:17,700
internal review but we will be asking

369
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,139
soon for working group last also we

370
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,590
asked the working group if you have

371
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:26,850
anything for example now Lu had pointed

372
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:29,039
out the IPSec support please raise the

373
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,678
issue before we call we ask for working

374
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,070
group last call the second draft the ete

375
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,539
tunnel modeling we had as I mentioned

376
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,029
received some comments from the yang

377
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:41,070
doctors review we will be addressing

378
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,379
those and we will be requesting a

379
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,549
working group last call after that the

380
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:50,158
last two documents there we are going

381
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:53,989
through another round of review for them

382
00:19:50,159 --> 00:20:00,080
before calling for yang doctors if you

383
00:19:53,989 --> 00:20:00,080
with this I close my presentation

384
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,000
questions yeah hi this is true from far

385
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,429
we have the question regarding the name

386
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,899
collision and especially the first point

387
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,269
in the name collision which was

388
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:18,758
regarding the controller learning the

389
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:22,179
tunnel name from devices which is the

390
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,009
same right and you using r1 r2 so do you

391
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,529
have little bit more details about where

392
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:30,190
will our one string will come and and

393
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:33,940
how would you where is this coming from

394
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:36,190
r1 exactly of the source as a string how

395
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,519
would you figure it out so that's a fair

396
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,409
point so one one proposal was to use the

397
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,129
source address which we have already in

398
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:49,000
the model but we think that you know it

399
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:52,750
can be a DNS name or or maybe a

400
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
configurable name on the of the Ingres

401
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,610
itself but so far we said the source

402
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,100
address is going to be appended for

403
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,830
example if you think that's not

404
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,289
user-friendly we should look into the

405
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,470
different option I'm feeling like why

406
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:11,500
did we put name as the only key and not

407
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:15,100
put source and name together as a key

408
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:18,429
that's another but maybe it's too late

409
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,799
that's another yeah it's a fair point so

410
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,889
we have one list that contains all the

411
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:28,269
tunnels from all the devices we could

412
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:29,979
split multiple lists per device but we

413
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,139
wanted that the model itself to sit on

414
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,740
either a device or the controller so

415
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:37,418
this is why we took this approach this

416
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,649
problem shows up only if the controller

417
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,840
is trying to put everything in the same

418
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:42,969
data scope and the assumption is that

419
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,139
the controller knows whom it's getting

420
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,529
it from and it will take the

421
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:50,408
corresponding source ID n dependent how

422
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,360
you know the society I mean the

423
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,769
assumption is that there is because you

424
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,029
are getting the data out from a

425
00:21:53,769 --> 00:22:00,759
particular source you use that

426
00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:03,690
particular source ID am dependent it's a

427
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,690
fair point thank you for raising it

428
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,690
Thanks

429
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:39,400
so next up I'm chief you know from water

430
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:46,570
networks I'm here to give a quick update

431
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:54,700
to tu topology model documents the first

432
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:57,100
one is Larry Harvey model so this is a

433
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:01,830
working group document so we have some

434
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:06,189
changes since last revision this model

435
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:09,310
hires some dependencies there are two

436
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:14,020
other document with depend on when is

437
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:20,040
the IDF ki-jung T types

438
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:22,240
another one is 32 party so post

439
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,879
dependency models have been changed

440
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,240
since last revision so we updated our

441
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,990
model to align with them then each of

442
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,880
those two documents has two modules so

443
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,990
we need a line possibly all the other

444
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:42,850
modules there another piece of changes

445
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:44,710
would be the trying to resolve doctors

446
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:50,370
reveal comments this is an ongoing

447
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:54,600
process we have fixed the editorial

448
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:59,379
errors and we will start still

449
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:04,870
discussing the other comments which is

450
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:08,110
ongoing so particularly this is one we

451
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:12,760
need to explain the relationship in the

452
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:16,600
hierarchy of our topology to the related

453
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,000
dependencies we have argumentations we

454
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:25,610
have a difference

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:31,840
so we also imported some several types

456
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:35,840
model so this is need to be resolved and

457
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:40,580
another issue this discussion was

458
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:45,110
brought up in last IETF so it's about

459
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:49,879
performance metrics unity reaction or

460
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:52,699
link and the discussion was that usually

461
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,600
for the accurate when we delay

462
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,789
measurement we need the clock

463
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,730
synchronization but in on some system

464
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:04,250
such kind of mechanism is not there in

465
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:07,840
that case the system where yours a

466
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,590
two-way measurement to do the estimate

467
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,020
divided the two way

468
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,139
delayed by two so in that case the

469
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:19,039
two-way measurement measure could be

470
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:23,480
useful so crack you have more comment on

471
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:27,710
this okay okay thank you Greg University

472
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:32,830
City yes clock synchronization is

473
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:38,390
important for accurate delay measurement

474
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:42,740
packet loss measurement and delay

475
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:51,260
variation are not susceptible to Quogue

476
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:54,140
synchronization so so we've had a few

477
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:58,429
discussions that we also talked about

478
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:02,390
this during our weekly meetings so the

479
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:05,980
current approaches that we still keep

480
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:08,299
that two-way matrix value of there and

481
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:12,169
so could be yours for dependence

482
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:14,799
situation and them so that we keep the

483
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,799
model at this

484
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:29,449
actually it would be useful if quark

485
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,450
synchronization the question is that how

486
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,700
it can be determined that's a

487
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,600
interesting question and problem where

488
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,940
the clock synchronization quality is

489
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,969
sufficient so it may be the clock

490
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:49,030
synchronization does exist the quality

491
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:52,400
of the clock synchronization maybe not

492
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:54,410
at the level requirement because there

493
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,860
might be some applications for example

494
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:01,550
Auto reliable low latency communication

495
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:04,280
in 5g that requires very high quality of

496
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:11,090
clock synchronization what I want to say

497
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:14,770
is that using two-way measurement to

498
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:18,620
calculate one-way metrics is useful

499
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:21,650
what's important is that then it has to

500
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:24,169
be specially noted that this one-way

501
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:30,970
metrics is calculated based on two

502
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:33,980
metric measurement case one says me

503
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:36,920
Rakesh Francisco so do you have both

504
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:40,040
one-way and two it populated or you only

505
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,230
have one or the other we have both you

506
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,300
have both so in some cases if you only

507
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,140
know one way then you don't have the

508
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,780
two-way so it has to use that value okay

509
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,730
because if you are how to wait then you

510
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,710
can divide that by two and that could be

511
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,030
one way and that's how you can compute

512
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,440
the one way but you're saying it's one

513
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:02,690
or the other depending on how the

514
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:07,520
measurement is done yeah actually what I

515
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:12,020
want to know is that there are been

516
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:15,080
developed measurement methods active

517
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:24,080
measurement methods that provide both

518
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:28,580
one way into a matrix so for example t1

519
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,780
and stem protocols you can do one-way

520
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,620
and two-way measurement

521
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:40,639
so hold on there so uh right so back to

522
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,270
laser modeling right so internal

523
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,990
modeling

524
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:50,550
do you see any changes need to be added

525
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:53,200
to this actually it's very good question

526
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:57,320
[Music]

527
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:00,260
for stent protocol is a simple two way

528
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:05,090
after measurement protocol we do have a

529
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,309
portion that I have a separately the the

530
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:11,090
synchrotron synchronization model

531
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:14,720
separate the rights of it again as I

532
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:17,959
mentioned I think that clock

533
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,840
synchronization and quality of clock

534
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,770
synchronization it's very it's a

535
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:30,280
separate question and it something that

536
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:34,129
I'm not aware of methods to quantify it

537
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:37,940
and how to monitor it how to measure the

538
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:41,390
quality for their performance

539
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:46,490
measurement we can discuss how your

540
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:49,420
model related to stampy and model which

541
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,679
is IBM working group draft right so

542
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,450
please be reminded this is a team

543
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,120
although we are not this is not

544
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:59,900
performance metric for measurement model

545
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,559
right so internal te T matrix here yes

546
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:08,300
so we are using the three types so the

547
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:10,580
krupin's there and if if you have

548
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,440
something need to be added that that's

549
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,230
probably more troublesome because it's

550
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,190
already passed Rosco so and then if it's

551
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,179
okay you can live with this then I'll

552
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:24,710
take a look then

553
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:31,630
yeah I was not aware of that but I think

554
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:31,630
it will be good if ma if model that

555
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:39,980
measurement protocol produces is easy to

556
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:42,850
map into their model that characterizes

557
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,850
link performance

558
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:57,010
so after

559
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:03,760
with I think we can move on to the next

560
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:09,970
step then the next model SR I star model

561
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:14,770
also arguments the nursery unicast to

562
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:19,260
poly model and that could be a te so we

563
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:26,530
in that case we were inherited from te

564
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:32,310
then after last revision we also tell

565
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:37,899
some changes to align the most recent

566
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:41,740
the spring I saw young model so we took

567
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:44,650
their latest grouping and use that we

568
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:48,750
also have this model revealed by young

569
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:52,360
doctor and we have a fixed some

570
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:58,570
auditorium problems and then now we

571
00:31:52,360 --> 00:32:04,419
still discussing some issues to be

572
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:06,899
resolved when is the one comment is

573
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:11,620
about constraints and some of the

574
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:15,370
attributes relatively to ice are we

575
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:19,560
added those constraints to our model but

576
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:24,340
I think in the better way would be to

577
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:30,010
add those into the coping we are using

578
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:34,060
fun so this is the ice our spring be our

579
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:35,680
model so we talk to the houses up after

580
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,760
days so we're trying to see if we can

581
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:44,730
move those changes to the base model and

582
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:49,690
also there is a discussion but the URI

583
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:53,410
format user ID so this this is we don't

584
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:58,090
have much we can do now because this is

585
00:32:53,410 --> 00:33:04,390
the base network to partly model which

586
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:06,780
we inherited so about which tree which

587
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,940
kind of format we want to use is you are

588
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,490
I only want to use the screen but it's

589
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:19,320
already there so it's just to whatever

590
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:21,960
we can and after that to the match

591
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:53,220
yes and we'll move to the next step

592
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:55,650
that's it hi everyone this is truth I'm

593
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,830
will be presenting two presentations the

594
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:01,950
first one is on the Vienna yank so I

595
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:04,199
think this we know that VN is the

596
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,750
customer facing yang model which she

597
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,870
uses lots of things from the T topology

598
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,379
and the d tunnel model the relationship

599
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,509
is as shown in the figure though nothing

600
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:18,540
has changed here the main changes in the

601
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:21,750
document is we added a introduction in

602
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:25,259
the introduction section a details about

603
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:27,210
how this model can be used in the 5g use

604
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,450
cases and this is something that is

605
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:32,220
being gonna be discussed specifically in

606
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:35,040
the second half of the tease you have

607
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:38,549
some topics on 5g so we also linked it

608
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:42,649
up in the a CT and VN yang and we hope

609
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:45,860
that this young model can be a basis for

610
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:48,299
virtual network even in the 5g world

611
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:53,310
apart from that the changes were mostly

612
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,350
editorial so far and we've made some

613
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,500
clarifications in our diagram make the

614
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:00,660
pointers to the JSON examples little bit

615
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,960
clearer so that people who read the

616
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,149
model can understand how this model uses

617
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,460
the connectivity matrices of the T

618
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,610
topology to show the relationship

619
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:15,180
between the million members in the yang

620
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:19,110
model itself one change was that we were

621
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,580
using the LTP without reference so we

622
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,920
changed that we have

623
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,290
now using a reference so that it has to

624
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,290
be asked configured in the topology

625
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,660
model and apart from that in the yang

626
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,370
model we added reference statement to

627
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,430
make sure that wherever we are referring

628
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:38,580
a leaf we have a pointer to a draft or

629
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:41,040
an RFC so these were the changes but the

630
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,500
main thing is the open questions that

631
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,470
were discussed on the list and we don't

632
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,350
have a resolution on that maybe the

633
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:52,080
first one is pretty straightforward it's

634
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:56,880
just a understanding question but that

635
00:35:52,080 --> 00:36:02,580
led to the bigger question which is can

636
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:05,340
a VN member be from P to PE so the

637
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,700
concern came from currently we define VN

638
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,810
as a list of VN members and where a VN

639
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:16,200
member has a source and destination a P

640
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:20,040
and a P according to us is a logical

641
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:22,500
identifier between the C and a PE so we

642
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,529
always expect the C customer-facing

643
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,100
information to be a key part of our

644
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:32,040
definition of VN member but for some use

645
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:35,160
cases folks are saying that they want to

646
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,860
create a virtual network first and then

647
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:43,069
attach the customer-facing information

648
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:45,960
later so set up for instance a set of

649
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,820
tunnels which are starting from P to P I

650
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,040
am NOT attaching customer information

651
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,980
now let me set up a set of tunnels and

652
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,060
then when I do the customer mapping I

653
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,430
can do the C mapping easier so the first

654
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,040
question is should we allow this and if

655
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:05,069
we allow it what will be the possible

656
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,070
ways to do it and some of the possible

657
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,630
solutions that I could think of we kind

658
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,640
of wrote it down and we had some

659
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,320
discussions but we did not have any

660
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,330
resolution so this is something that we

661
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,820
want to work on between this and the

662
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,819
next idea and hopefully close on this

663
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,220
actually what do you suggest that you

664
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,180
change the API I think it makes sense

665
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,730
but I refer to the figure pair and I

666
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:37,509
figure floating of the actn4

667
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:40,359
work actually the supportive you know

668
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,940
for AP supported the customer view and

669
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:45,640
operator view for the an opponent could

670
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,109
be the C and it could be the P so we

671
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,770
already covered that yes

672
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:52,990
yeah so that's why just changing to AP

673
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,509
will solve the problem but I think the

674
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:58,509
bigger problem we should focus on is can

675
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:03,970
we have a VN member without any customer

676
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:07,990
with just p2p so so ap is a identifier

677
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:10,990
between C and PE you need to have at

678
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,359
least some C information what we really

679
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:16,839
want your requirement is let us have

680
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:21,130
just p2p we are member without having

681
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,750
any attached C II so so that requirement

682
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:27,340
we want to drill down a little bit and

683
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:30,160
see how we can solve it so it's not the

684
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,720
matter of what you call l1 l2 whether

685
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,850
they are called ap or whether they are

686
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,649
called endpoints I think the main

687
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:40,118
question is should we allow e to PE

688
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:42,670
tunnels as a VN member yeah

689
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,990
yeah you agree that that's the main

690
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:48,670
issue here you are yeah okay yeah no

691
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,950
have I explained the second issue

692
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,450
well because it's coming from you maybe

693
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,710
I'm misunderstanding this will be a good

694
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,009
time to hash it

695
00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:01,630
yeah but secondly issue since you know

696
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:03,520
you follow the ACM for my paralegal 14

697
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,619
you support a custom view and operate of

698
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,450
view so you need to distinguish if you

699
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,040
change if you have each other so how do

700
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,759
you do that actually the solution you

701
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,150
may propose you may introduce some

702
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,300
indicator whether it is custom view or

703
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,330
it's operator view another choice is you

704
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:26,470
may introduce the additional maybe we

705
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:28,960
call the node ID and to support this p2p

706
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:33,160
connectivity yeah that's maybe the

707
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,840
loopback one so you are fine with these

708
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,129
solutions but I think the bigger

709
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,660
question to the group would be that that

710
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,190
what's what what do you think about this

711
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,990
requirement first and then we can

712
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:48,859
further drill down on solutions

713
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:51,529
sorry so just want to confirm so when

714
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:55,369
you mention the Lubeck actually it is

715
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:58,640
already defined in the model you can

716
00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:01,359
actually yes you can use it as it is

717
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,589
without making any change it's just an

718
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,200
identifier we have done that for

719
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:08,359
instance when you configure a vrf you

720
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,848
can you bind the loopback interface to

721
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,470
the vrf it's just like that like usually

722
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:15,320
it is for the customer-facing interface

723
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,660
but your loopback interface can also get

724
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,580
binded to an vrf so I am kinda equating

725
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,950
the concept of the there you don't need

726
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,630
to change anything it's just when you

727
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,710
when you don't know the information bind

728
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,530
loopback later on

729
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:30,880
attach the actual customer interface

730
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:35,240
when you have it something like that

731
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,150
yeah I don't know which one is a good

732
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,609
pasture choice Chester when another

733
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,950
option actually you can introduce some

734
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:45,529
indicator to distinguish whether it is

735
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,960
custom view or yeah that's another

736
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,810
solution that make it clear what is it

737
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,060
referring to like make it ap can be in

738
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,859
between it could be just see endpoint or

739
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:58,150
it could be a P endpoint so that's

740
00:40:54,859 --> 00:41:01,609
another solution which is coming for you

741
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,520
why do you limit your comment actn why

742
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:09,500
isn't this a generic comment oh why did

743
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:11,599
scoped actn it's a that's nothing in the

744
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,119
discussion I heard specific controller

745
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,119
based yeah no no I think that this is

746
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,070
the moto ad as I comment on it is that I

747
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,050
want you this the model should be

748
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,570
generic remote oh not a couple ways that

749
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:26,869
a city and framework but I just a few

750
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,030
example because you know that arrived

751
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:31,520
from the ICT and framework so there's

752
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:39,890
some example there's some figure so we

753
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:43,310
may actually yes yes so we obviously

754
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:48,140
could be used in many configurations

755
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:52,339
right so my understanding is that you

756
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:56,109
see VM as a node which has basically

757
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:58,538
links open-ended links right and it's

758
00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:01,750
isn't it's the

759
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:04,869
the responsibility of what you call tea

760
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:08,109
service mapping to assign sees to to

761
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:10,299
year so if it's all done it should be

762
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:13,270
decouple to write it it doesn't have to

763
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:16,450
come as a single thing you can talk

764
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:20,339
about VM like for example like an

765
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:23,759
abstract apology or set of tunnels

766
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:27,308
independently from the users of that

767
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,990
so according let me make sure that I

768
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,779
understood your comment correctly you

769
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:34,240
are saying that it's already there like

770
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:34,660
we can do this right now is that what

771
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,348
you meant

772
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:42,098
yeah I I think that the VM as the

773
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:44,770
service doesn't include clients of the

774
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:48,700
surahs it's actually the model that

775
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:51,670
map's clients for the service it could

776
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,680
be done at the same time or later or it

777
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,680
could be changed at any time all right

778
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:02,529
you can take one C and put another one

779
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:07,240
without any any modification of VM all

780
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:09,579
right so I think it's perfectly legal to

781
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:15,609
think about V and without seas

782
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:17,710
okay thank you Daniela so I think the

783
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:18,308
requirement to make sense but I quite

784
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:26,319
agree

785
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:30,730
surprised with ego because I think the

786
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:33,369
PI ap doesn't necessarily imply the sea

787
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:36,760
in the sense that you can have with the

788
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:40,990
AP has one-to-one mapping with the P

789
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:46,240
node and a sort of oak with nothing

790
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:47,828
appended to it it'll all go see from

791
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,828
away just a question what is the

792
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:54,190
difference between a p2p VM memberid and

793
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:57,849
why not using a tunnel model because I

794
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:02,230
see a little bit I understand the V

795
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:03,789
remember between attachment points I I

796
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:09,349
try to understand why not using the

797
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:11,450
tunnel model for p2p D do

798
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:18,210
we want to talk about that once again

799
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:18,210
[Laughter]

800
00:44:23,680 --> 00:45:03,440
yeah so this one is the recently adopted

801
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:05,269
document so I'm sure you all have would

802
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,079
have read it and it will be fresh in

803
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:11,479
your memory and what does this model do

804
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:13,460
if it is not that we define the

805
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:16,218
performance monitoring telemetry

806
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:20,569
information so these are the two yang

807
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:25,569
models which augment the T model and the

808
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:27,849
VN model and it includes the performance

809
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:31,069
the performance monitoring parameters

810
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:33,400
which you could subscribe to and apart

811
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:36,650
from that it also has this scaling

812
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,739
information so most of the changes that

813
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:42,259
we did in the recent this was to

814
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:43,609
describe the scaling but much more

815
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:45,529
clearly because I think the performance

816
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:47,989
parameters were pretty clear but the

817
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:50,479
concept of what is scaling and what do

818
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:52,930
we mean by these terms that we are using

819
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:55,729
that was not here so we worked on

820
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:58,598
improving and adding clarification for

821
00:45:55,729 --> 00:46:01,759
that added a terminology section etc and

822
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,950
also why are examples described the

823
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:07,029
network autonomics part and what do we

824
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:09,499
mean in the context of this document

825
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:10,819
there was a comment with respect to what

826
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:13,459
is the right reference for the

827
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:16,038
notification mechanism the security

828
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:19,099
section I on a section and all the other

829
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,960
yang style guides and references etc

830
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:23,190
thanks to everyone who commented during

831
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,410
the adoption process

832
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,550
while we made these good changes to the

833
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:31,890
documents so regarding the terminology

834
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:35,069
this is something that we kind of put

835
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:37,290
down in our document the key performance

836
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:40,500
data that's pretty clear these are the

837
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:44,609
set of parameters performance parameters

838
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:46,859
delay delay jitter things like that that

839
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:51,240
we are monitoring on the VL level and T

840
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:53,670
level we describe what is scaling in our

841
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,180
document that is either you are scaling

842
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:59,310
in your resources or scaling out so

843
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,790
within the context of a tea tunnel of

844
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:06,690
how your resources can be modified

845
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:09,089
that's what we mean by scaling and with

846
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,160
the intent what we meant was put

847
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:13,470
conditions like while you are monitoring

848
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,710
these parameters you could also put

849
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:19,410
conditions that this condition on that

850
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,290
parameter should be met and at that time

851
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,390
I should scale in or scale out so that's

852
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:27,690
what we meant by the the scaling

853
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:30,779
conditions and the intent that we put so

854
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:34,079
by combining the actual data in the yang

855
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,180
model plus these conditions for scaling

856
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,270
and scaling out we are meeting the

857
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:42,868
requirements for network autonomics

858
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:46,680
within the limited scope of the T and

859
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:48,390
the VN model so that's how is with

860
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,460
respect to the terminology so hopefully

861
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:54,868
this can help clear up some confusion

862
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,800
that was there earlier so this part

863
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:59,130
hasn't changed

864
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,290
we are simply augmenting these models

865
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:05,579
adding performance parameters putting

866
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:07,829
the scaling conditions etc with respect

867
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,800
to scaling which is the one which we may

868
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:13,710
have to drill down a little bit so

869
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,619
basically how we are setting the scaling

870
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,329
condition you are mentioning whether you

871
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:20,250
need to scale up whether this is a

872
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:25,130
scaling out condition or a scaling in

873
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:28,589
what kind of metric you want to monitor

874
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:31,290
at the time of scaling what is the value

875
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:33,930
when it reaches that threshold that's

876
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:36,359
when the condition is hit and also you

877
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,069
have a ability to put

878
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,288
multiple conditions that you can be

879
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:42,480
monitoring multiple parameters so

880
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:45,809
whether it's an aunt condition or

881
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,069
condition min max things like that we

882
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:52,259
could combine multiple performance

883
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:55,019
parameters and threshold values via the

884
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:56,579
scaling operation type and of course we

885
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:58,288
did not we wanted to make sure that

886
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:00,960
there are some durations involved that

887
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:02,880
the threshold must be read must be met

888
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,190
for a particular time and there should

889
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,349
be some cooldown time before the same

890
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,619
conditions get hit again to solve those

891
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:15,630
problems we had put these parameters and

892
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:18,269
this is one example where you are

893
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,819
scaling for while monitoring the two-way

894
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:23,910
delay metric with a threshold value of

895
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:27,150
300 milliseconds and scaling conditions

896
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:29,399
for utilized bandwidth for again some MB

897
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,890
and by combining these two conditions

898
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,920
you are saying that when this particular

899
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:37,529
condition is met I must scale out in

900
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,619
this particular manner so this is still

901
00:49:37,529 --> 00:49:43,079
work-in-progress this is the thing that

902
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,299
we have we are open to suggestions on

903
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,589
what is the best way to model this and

904
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:53,130
if there is any suggestions from the

905
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:56,130
group we are all yes thank you so when

906
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:59,369
when the client tries to configure

907
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:04,529
scaling of the tunnel right basically

908
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:08,700
defines conditions defines thresholds so

909
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:10,980
according to a model I assume that you

910
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,879
have to take their leaves from their

911
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:18,900
model and configure them properly right

912
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:23,730
but what if if client has something in

913
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,670
mind like combination of say two leaves

914
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:29,789
that you didn't envision stuff like that

915
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:34,289
so it would be very awkward so you have

916
00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:38,210
to go and modify the model so it means

917
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:41,339
basically what you're trying to do is

918
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:44,519
envision the logic of the client of

919
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:47,430
doing such thing so well what I think

920
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:50,549
the better way to do this is what

921
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:52,700
net mode guys doing what

922
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:57,390
for example we try to introduce

923
00:50:52,700 --> 00:51:00,660
basically some automation based on young

924
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:02,549
which doesn't do it in the form of logic

925
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,730
rather than in terms of configure

926
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:08,099
beliefs defines the thresholds defines

927
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:12,710
the combinations of different things

928
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:21,900
that triggers particular event and

929
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:28,920
actions according to this event greg-

930
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:34,589
tzt in our discussion in IBM working

931
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:37,289
group and with their feedback from those

932
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:40,109
or using active measurement performance

933
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:44,279
in the field on the network so what we

934
00:51:40,109 --> 00:51:51,180
learn is that min and Max are not very

935
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:54,450
useful metrics minimum and maximum mean

936
00:51:51,180 --> 00:52:00,180
is a little bit more useful but what is

937
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:04,200
most useful is a percentile and usually

938
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:10,848
they do three levels of percentile 95 99

939
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:13,919
in 99.9 and these may be used as

940
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:16,710
thresholds so once you have a test

941
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,480
session you can determine their

942
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:24,470
percentile of the test session and

943
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,470
compare it to the threshold

944
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:35,900
stampy and model stamp stamp

945
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:47,809
it's a working group document IP game

946
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:50,700
thank you craft about the te telemetry

947
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:53,250
generally this model is augmenting the

948
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:57,210
Tito Nova which is a very general and

949
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:59,609
the technology free model so we have

950
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,140
also the plans to integrate those kind

951
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:03,029
of technology specific

952
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:07,279
performance monitoring parameters here

953
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:10,170
or we allow the augmentation for the

954
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,950
technology specific performance

955
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:16,650
monitoring parameters right now in T's

956
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:18,060
of course we we don't but we hope like

957
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,100
now if there is an interest we can take

958
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,740
some work to seek out which can use this

959
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:26,460
as a base and add any technology

960
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:28,049
specific things onto it right now we

961
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,360
don't have anything but yeah if there is

962
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:52,130
an interest we can further talk about it

963
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:52,130
what we can take you Zika thank you

964
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:16,359
thank you

965
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:18,250
emitter woozy from away and presenting

966
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:20,558
the dimple assessing an extension for

967
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:24,130
schirmer's protections on behalf of

968
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:25,510
quarters and what is the use of this

969
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,180
document is document as we recently

970
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,430
adopted as a working group document at

971
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,529
the beginning of this year and we have

972
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,529
some just submitted before this that you

973
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:37,660
have a new update with where we are try

974
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:39,760
to address some comments we received

975
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,740
earlier working group adoption one of

976
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,769
them was clarifying the difference

977
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,799
between SNP share mesh protection and SM

978
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:50,379
RMS reservation as already defined in SC

979
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:52,809
48 72 and another comment we got was

980
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:55,180
about what to do for APS configuration

981
00:54:52,809 --> 00:54:57,369
we have also worked with some new

982
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,769
co-authors on how to describe

983
00:54:57,369 --> 00:55:03,670
notifications and we have new coders

984
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:05,769
that provided input to this update so

985
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:08,740
what is the problem we had arrested with

986
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:10,720
notification what happens is that since

987
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,758
the protection part that is reserved is

988
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,950
shared by multiple protecting Alice

989
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:17,140
pizza it could happen that the failure

990
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,700
on protecting Alice pin number 2 will

991
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,400
make unavailable for protection

992
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,538
switching a protecting LSP number 1 and

993
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,049
we want to notify the

994
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:27,789
Edendale end of this protecting LSP that

995
00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:30,460
this part is no longer available such

996
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:33,190
that it doesn't try to activate this

997
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:36,160
part as the activation will fail and and

998
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:38,289
the solution we have found is that we

999
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,348
may be the solution could be that the

1000
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:43,240
node where the text susanna Binion

1001
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:46,210
available send a pattern or a

1002
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,220
reservation error with the sakoda policy

1003
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:52,000
control failure harder preempted them

1004
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:55,808
and also it's set the past state remove

1005
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,390
flag must not set it because the reason

1006
00:55:55,809 --> 00:56:00,190
is that we want to notify the end until

1007
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:02,140
ended area the protection part is not

1008
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,869
available but we don't want the LSP to

1009
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:07,269
be tore down and we would like to get

1010
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:08,920
that's the solution we found but our

1011
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:10,899
discussion we were not under percent

1012
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,690
sure and we wanted to get feedback from

1013
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:15,430
the working group about whether we have

1014
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,330
resolved the problem and this exactly

1015
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:19,120
the right way

1016
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:21,310
or to implement to notify the endpoints

1017
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:24,850
not to activate a part but without

1018
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:26,920
tearing down the state and then when

1019
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:29,950
issues become an away available back

1020
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,830
again so the protecting LSP number two

1021
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,480
is no longer active you get the APS and

1022
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:38,080
then you go back to it put pattern

1023
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,630
reservation yes Perry from juniper I did

1024
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,990
not read the draft but something caught

1025
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,300
my eye

1026
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:46,479
why wouldn't you use soft preemption

1027
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:49,000
notification so soft preemption like

1028
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,600
resource not available and that would

1029
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,720
not tear down the LSB and maybe we can

1030
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,870
take it off okay yeah yeah almost not

1031
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,879
aware of this option okay yeah we can

1032
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:03,670
think about that yeah it is not to tear

1033
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,160
down and to let the end as the LSP is

1034
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:09,160
not don't try to activate it with ApS

1035
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,310
that's that's intention yeah okay good

1036
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:14,410
suggestion thank you okay then the

1037
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:17,620
second open issue that we are discussing

1038
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:21,450
is about the SNP preemption priority in

1039
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:24,660
edo edo tree there are the rules our

1040
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:27,339
order is that in case of competition

1041
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,129
between two different protocol SP trying

1042
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:32,950
to assess the same resource the first it

1043
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,480
will be used SNP preemption priority and

1044
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:37,240
if they have the same preemption

1045
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,680
priority will be the aps priority and if

1046
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,080
they have the same address parity we

1047
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:43,480
will use the LSP D&D failure to decide

1048
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:46,090
which one of the of the two LSP will

1049
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,640
assess the resource and but after

1050
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:50,320
SanDisk we try to encode the SNP

1051
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,480
preemption priority defined in a tomato

1052
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,490
tree into GMP less at top and only

1053
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,590
priority but it looks like they are

1054
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:58,689
quite different because the MPLS a top

1055
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:03,130
priority in all priority unrelated to

1056
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:05,290
the activation on the state so to the

1057
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,600
setup of the LSP while the idea is that

1058
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:10,060
when the s and the protection LSP is

1059
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,569
preempted we want to keep the state

1060
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:16,180
again as before so the ID our feeling is

1061
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:18,340
that we should not use the GMP let's set

1062
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:21,779
up and all the priority but we should

1063
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:24,640
have a new object that carry the SNP

1064
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,620
preemption priority and then we have two

1065
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,210
options one is to define a new object or

1066
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,410
the other option is to define a new

1067
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,450
field within the protection

1068
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,339
object and we don't have any strong

1069
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:36,669
opinion about which one of the two we

1070
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:39,040
prefer like we will appreciate any input

1071
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:42,580
from from the working group on whether

1072
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,670
you have a preference I think that the

1073
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,950
advantage of they did put they using the

1074
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:49,990
existing object means no new IANA

1075
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:53,290
location but may have impact on existing

1076
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:58,529
implementation so we don't have strong

1077
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:58,529
opinion but maybe others may have

1078
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:08,680
already defined we had a new flex yes'm

1079
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:11,740
the idea here is to add a new field

1080
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:18,430
where you configure and I think is the

1081
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:26,470
three bit preemption priority bill yeah

1082
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:28,960
yeah the next comment is about issue is

1083
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:30,759
about ApS configuration here the

1084
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,790
situation is a little bit difficult

1085
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:37,450
the APS protocol is for further study in

1086
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:41,080
808 or trim and the meaning of this is

1087
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,850
that the protocol itself which is using

1088
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,650
the plain the protocol and message

1089
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:48,009
format is technology and or vendor

1090
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:50,380
specific 808 or 3 is generic and it

1091
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:52,060
means that since there is no generic ApS

1092
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:54,160
protocol means that every technology can

1093
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,170
define its own one and for example in

1094
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:01,180
Ooty and we have it's basically vendor

1095
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:03,780
specific and and we need most of the ApS

1096
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:06,549
configuration is can be done before any

1097
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,150
LSP is a tapa so there is no impact on

1098
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,760
gmpls

1099
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:13,750
the only issue that may have an impact

1100
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,490
on the GPS is the fact that ApS protocol

1101
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,830
message when they request activate a

1102
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:21,069
given protecting LSP they need to

1103
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:22,810
identify the protection a lesbian and we

1104
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:25,150
think that may make some implantation

1105
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:28,270
meri use the gmpls LSP dent if I just

1106
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:30,370
identified the LSP or sort of a shinky

1107
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:33,370
like that other implementation may

1108
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:35,560
define an ApS identifier and this ap

1109
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:37,660
identifier needs to be configured when

1110
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,720
the LSP is set up and this has an impact

1111
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:42,850
on RSVP D because that's the time where

1112
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,790
you assigned is identifier

1113
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:48,430
and since this is not discussed in the

1114
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:51,040
itu-t data plane we are evaluating

1115
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:52,930
different options so for which we have

1116
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,390
not fully not only photos are in

1117
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:58,029
agreement so input from the working

1118
01:00:55,390 --> 01:01:01,509
group is really appreciated the one is

1119
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:03,250
to kill say this outer scope since it's

1120
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:05,880
for further study in edo edo tree and

1121
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:08,260
let every vendor figured out what to do

1122
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,290
another option could be to define a new

1123
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:14,320
object and say is the content is vendor

1124
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:16,960
specific third option could be to define

1125
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,630
a new object which is a sort of TLV

1126
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,420
structure where you can say some types

1127
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:24,610
are allocated for standard tracker in

1128
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:27,790
case of we have a standard technology

1129
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:30,280
specific aps we can develop we can say

1130
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:32,590
for this specific aps protocol that's

1131
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,590
the the days of the structure of the TLV

1132
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:38,200
and some other can be for example expert

1133
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:44,500
review or private allocation for vendor

1134
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:50,169
specific aps so i mean any opinion about

1135
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:51,910
what's the best approach because we

1136
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:56,830
don't have a standard reference for the

1137
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:59,710
aps so we do have these three options

1138
01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:02,410
the please open issue we will get input

1139
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,760
and then we want to resolve this open

1140
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:11,440
issue and get further feedbacks and

1141
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:16,990
comments it seems to me that you're not

1142
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:19,000
being consistent and you look to see

1143
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:21,549
that to make sure you're recognized that

1144
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,610
you're proposing are aligned with with

1145
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:27,490
those RFC's in particular how you notify

1146
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:28,410
about errors and faults and protection

1147
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:36,009
switch over

1148
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:40,270
yeah well 4d yes the reason is that in

1149
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:43,150
the 40s 72 sm r LS the protecting

1150
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:46,509
Laspisa actually turn down when you have

1151
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:56,160
a preemption and no that's most my

1152
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:56,160
understand notifies okay

1153
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,369
when you don't have to change state in

1154
01:02:58,989 --> 01:03:03,160
the intermediate nodes that's why the

1155
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:05,140
notify was used because then you can

1156
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,999
directly target that and they get a much

1157
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:14,190
faster switchover so your suggestion is

1158
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:14,189
to use notify instead okay okay okay

1159
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:24,759
symmetry as well okay yes okay and not

1160
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:27,269
saying you're not doing something a

1161
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:31,779
little new that's why we have the draft

1162
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:33,368
but okay thanks for really doing okay

1163
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:35,140
for the notification we will review that

1164
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:36,210
and try to align that that's a good

1165
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,890
suggestion

1166
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:41,109
but for preemption priority with the

1167
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:45,609
little bit different because yeah and I

1168
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:49,239
keep yes and there is nothing about that

1169
01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:52,479
because the preemption priority for SMR

1170
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:55,809
is relying on gmpls a top priority but

1171
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:57,848
and that's with the fact that the

1172
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:59,619
preemption the prior the LSB is

1173
01:03:57,849 --> 01:04:01,930
preempted and removed from the from the

1174
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:04,509
control plane and here what we want is

1175
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:07,210
to keep in the control plane and not

1176
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:16,239
activate that in the data plane and so I

1177
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:23,950
think is often - okay new feel the

1178
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:28,660
Redeem protection of okay okay okay and

1179
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:32,019
then what what about a PS configuration

1180
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:38,259
I mean it's just trying to allow people

1181
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:39,910
to add their own just basically to if

1182
01:04:38,259 --> 01:04:42,819
they need to configure not everybody

1183
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:45,910
needs to really add a new object because

1184
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:47,739
if you rely on the GLSL expediently fire

1185
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:50,109
to identify your LSP in the data plane

1186
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:53,319
you don't need to configure anything but

1187
01:04:50,109 --> 01:04:57,069
some many some people it may implement

1188
01:04:53,319 --> 01:05:04,170
ApS and using one byte ID and then you

1189
01:04:57,069 --> 01:05:06,279
you cannot get it but I know she has

1190
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:08,680
repeatedly said we have to be very

1191
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:11,710
careful not to be standardizing ahead

1192
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:14,379
of what the standard body that own these

1193
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:19,329
new technology is doing so I think we

1194
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:22,510
have to be a little careful here so I'm

1195
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:26,589
I'm a little bit worried about the

1196
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:30,760
options of two and three yeah that

1197
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:32,109
context so I think if we do do two and

1198
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,190
three we have to make sure that we're

1199
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:37,869
well aligned with the IQ TMS okay

1200
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:43,230
because at this moment in time there is

1201
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:43,230
no protocol definition in the specific

1202
01:05:47,010 --> 01:06:01,480
so you prefer to keep it out of scope I

1203
01:05:51,390 --> 01:06:10,900
suspected that don't embrace it okay you

1204
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:14,260
could say Deborah tell her I haven't

1205
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:16,480
following this one that ITU is this

1206
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:18,790
really the assumption and it's what my

1207
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,400
cutie the situation is the following

1208
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:23,558
eddo eddo tree it doesn't define any ApS

1209
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:26,530
protocol the sections is for further

1210
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:29,290
study so there is no generic protocol

1211
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:32,559
that applies to every technology so we

1212
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:35,619
in engineering gmpls we cannot define we

1213
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:39,010
have maybe to go specific and the only

1214
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:42,730
technology that is today defined for j4

1215
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:44,920
SNP is OTN SNP or you SNP and in that

1216
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,109
case we don't have any aps protocol

1217
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,640
defined we didn't agree on the format so

1218
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:53,049
idea under the way everybody is

1219
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:56,200
deploying G SMP with its own SM people I

1220
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:59,349
think their opportunity lays on I to say

1221
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:01,540
we're doing this doc to document it it's

1222
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:04,180
when it's not working group yet but we

1223
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:07,329
had the requirements this is working

1224
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:10,359
it's--that's lays on and asked asked the

1225
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:12,760
question if what their expectations are

1226
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:19,150
because the other is we should maybe do

1227
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:21,609
a vendor specific one you or the authors

1228
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:27,420
be willing to draft the liaison

1229
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:27,420
okay yeah okay okay okay thank you okay

1230
01:07:46,049 --> 01:07:49,930
good afternoon this humming from Holly

1231
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,940
and I'm going to present the

1232
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:54,690
interworking between the GM PRS and the

1233
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:57,460
central or centralized controller system

1234
01:07:54,690 --> 01:08:00,670
so this worker is the 30 the in last

1235
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:03,549
month's and we have brief quick update

1236
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:06,400
in July to capture and incorporated some

1237
01:08:03,549 --> 01:08:08,829
offline feedback from different

1238
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,099
operators and vendors so the main

1239
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:16,029
changes we also capture the open issue

1240
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:19,319
on the list between before the working

1241
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:21,850
group adoption to enable more

1242
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:24,759
interworking scenarios who is more

1243
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:27,279
explicit text descriptions on different

1244
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:30,850
scenarios so this time we updated by

1245
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:34,659
adding more details mainly on Marty Tom

1246
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:37,989
a scenario and we are continuously

1247
01:08:34,658 --> 01:08:41,649
working on adding the multi layer as

1248
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:44,799
well so let's see what has been changing

1249
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:48,250
so far in the last update so basically

1250
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:50,889
we originally were focus on the kind of

1251
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:55,118
GMP RS domain what we have have been

1252
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:58,810
enabled on among the devices but now we

1253
01:08:55,118 --> 01:09:00,849
are also received some feedback saying

1254
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:07,029
that this architecture should be general

1255
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:09,369
general enough to allow the interworking

1256
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:13,659
between the non-gm pairs to me and the

1257
01:09:09,368 --> 01:09:16,750
GM parents to me so the red block is

1258
01:09:13,658 --> 01:09:19,868
something we add to the figure saying

1259
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:22,839
that the architecture on the perspective

1260
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:25,330
of architecture the system can allow the

1261
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:27,939
interaction between the GMP RS and

1262
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:30,219
non-gm pairs but all the scope of this

1263
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:32,290
draft west still emphasizing the

1264
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:34,799
interworking between the controller and

1265
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:38,819
the GMP RS domain which is a red power

1266
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:41,639
part of this figure so and it is also

1267
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:47,339
worth noting that controller is a kind

1268
01:09:41,639 --> 01:09:50,040
of generic term used in some in the

1269
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:52,920
system and it can be either the SDN

1270
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:57,179
controller or the traditional ms/ms

1271
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,040
system and the difference is between the

1272
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:01,980
difference is mainly about the different

1273
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:07,260
protocols used between the controller

1274
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:10,678
and network devices so and then we also

1275
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:13,590
update the scenarios by providing text

1276
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:16,469
on how to do the service provisioning

1277
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:19,710
and especially for the multi domain

1278
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:25,500
cases and from this page and the next

1279
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:30,090
page we are providing that has to enable

1280
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:33,360
both end-to-end service provisioning and

1281
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:35,190
also pass segment solution so this pay

1282
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:40,880
tree is about the end-to-end narrow and

1283
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:46,379
we have two we have two domains both

1284
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:49,619
enabled in GM PRS protocols such as we

1285
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:54,690
can run the r3 Apte protocol for

1286
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:56,820
signaling and in this given this

1287
01:10:54,690 --> 01:11:00,379
architecture is a normal staff for

1288
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:03,269
provisioning and setup the RSP is to

1289
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:04,710
trigger the provisioning request from

1290
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:09,179
the orchestrator to one of the

1291
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:11,449
controller by using some existing young

1292
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:15,090
models in the restaurant protocols

1293
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:18,119
specifying IDF and also them and then

1294
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:21,599
the controller can transfer the kind of

1295
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:25,380
configuration to the head end node which

1296
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:29,460
is purely you done by piece app or not

1297
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:31,079
net calls protocol and then both the

1298
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:35,809
controller and the log history there are

1299
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:40,619
a ton of this itani in their job and the

1300
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:45,360
whole RSP enable would be covered by the

1301
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:49,820
head end notes and by using the RSVP tea

1302
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,820
protocols to do the signaling work

1303
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:56,350
and this processor can also be changed a

1304
01:11:53,949 --> 01:11:59,620
little bit to make an alternative

1305
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:04,150
procedure and make best use of the

1306
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:06,280
controller saying that the to say the

1307
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:07,960
first step is still the same to trigger

1308
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,659
the provisioning from the orchestrator

1309
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:14,199
to the controller but the second step is

1310
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:17,250
slightly different because the both of

1311
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:22,269
the controllers in the domain can

1312
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:25,810
initiate their respective head and now

1313
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:29,710
the to start off the gen PRS signaling

1314
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:32,070
and we also assume that there is GMP our

1315
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:35,770
signaling in the domain and also we can

1316
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:36,909
we implies as the ero label is included

1317
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:41,560
the Internet's heater from the

1318
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:45,210
controller tools I had a note so this is

1319
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:49,810
what we have been done so far to make

1320
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:58,210
the scenarios descriptions more complete

1321
01:12:49,810 --> 01:13:00,670
and we have also we have also have some

1322
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:03,820
considerations on provide more detailed

1323
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:05,440
about the multi-layer and the protection

1324
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:07,929
risk to toleration and also the

1325
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:10,210
controller reliability which has three

1326
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:13,150
subsections in the current draft need to

1327
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:15,280
be treated all the text and we are also

1328
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:18,009
targeting all adding more descriptions

1329
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:21,880
all non-gm parts domains are working

1330
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:25,150
which may introduce some different

1331
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:30,929
issues than the previous version of

1332
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:30,929
traps that's how the date update

1333
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:37,320
yeah I may have asked this question

1334
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,260
before but I don't know our

1335
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:44,099
responsibility o ask again yeah so this

1336
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:45,900
work covers initiating the cannot set up

1337
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,150
all that lets me set up from the heaven

1338
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:52,559
just like if you see the adaptors it

1339
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:55,710
also include transit position and coming

1340
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,790
to you both provisional into em yeah it

1341
01:13:55,710 --> 01:14:03,960
can be done

1342
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:07,110
end to end or segmented so I see a log

1343
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:10,650
segments being provision at every domain

1344
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:12,089
but do you also passes work also include

1345
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:15,690
the scenario very active go program

1346
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:17,340
every oh yes yes yes there you can do it

1347
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:22,259
so from the controller to each shop and

1348
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:30,150
just stitch it stitch every hop to form

1349
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:32,810
an end to end the RS billion thank you

1350
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:32,809
thank you

1351
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:25,140
you're gonna this is hi I'm Adrienne yes

1352
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:30,660
so that we have a design team for

1353
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:34,990
revising RC 3272 which is the te

1354
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:40,780
architecture framework document that is

1355
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:47,730
about a hundred years old next slide so

1356
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:49,840
we're supposed to be revising it because

1357
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:54,929
technology has changed our understanding

1358
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:57,760
of te has changed and broadened and

1359
01:15:54,930 --> 01:16:01,840
recent discussions in in a number of

1360
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:06,360
working groups in this area have become

1361
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:11,590
I don't know confused about the term te

1362
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:14,230
so we worked out that the terms in the

1363
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:16,870
document that exists are not adequate

1364
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:19,839
for today and the references are

1365
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:21,099
considerably out-of-date so we plan to

1366
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:27,010
revise it

1367
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:30,910
next slide so the chairs gave us a

1368
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:36,130
charter to make the update as a full

1369
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:39,010
revision not tweaks to strengthen the

1370
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:45,490
definitions and include new definitions

1371
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:48,820
as we needed and reference ongoing ITF

1372
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:51,219
work so the design team will produce

1373
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:53,530
regular updates and reports to the

1374
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:56,860
working group the time interval was not

1375
01:16:53,530 --> 01:17:13,480
specified zero is a ray

1376
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:18,130
number by oh yeah so we were instructed

1377
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:19,900
to report in Prague which we did but

1378
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:24,640
that was really only as we were setting

1379
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:28,690
up and then produce an initial draft in

1380
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:33,820
time for Montreal which we have not done

1381
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:37,839
next slide so what have we actually

1382
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:40,750
achieved not a huge amount we met in

1383
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:45,310
Prague and decided how we would work and

1384
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:48,730
how we would split up the work and then

1385
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:50,620
we converted the current RFC to cram

1386
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:55,320
down to give us something a base

1387
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:58,960
document to edit and I did most of that

1388
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:03,910
AC created a github venue for us and put

1389
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:06,280
the mark down there and a few of the

1390
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:08,680
teams started to make some changes or

1391
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:12,940
whatever the magic term you used for

1392
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:20,500
doing stuff in github but then next

1393
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:22,540
slide we got stuck I think probably a

1394
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:27,640
lot of the responsibilities to being

1395
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:32,250
stuff is mine I completely failed to

1396
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:34,510
bother to learn what github is and

1397
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:37,420
there's a real lesson there about

1398
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:39,700
choosing your tools it's only worth

1399
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:43,630
choosing tools that the people who are

1400
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:46,690
going to use the tools will use I think

1401
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:48,610
that team may be sufficiently large that

1402
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:55,690
we all know someone else will do the

1403
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:59,110
work we are all busy people and we just

1404
01:18:55,690 --> 01:19:00,910
didn't do anything so no draft not even

1405
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:06,700
close to having the draft ready to post

1406
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:07,990
next slide so I present the chairs and

1407
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,110
maybe the working group with four

1408
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:13,090
options option one reboot which we've

1409
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:18,210
kicked the team that we currently have

1410
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:22,300
to do some real work option two is

1411
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:23,980
kicked that same team but used different

1412
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:28,750
tools and techniques and hopefully

1413
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:32,410
deliver option three replace some or all

1414
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:37,660
of the team including probably me an

1415
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:46,059
option for simply give up on the idea of

1416
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:51,309
revising this RFC discuss to you

1417
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:57,990
personally the design team differently

1418
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:57,990
or the same or and please don't answer

1419
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:04,690
let me answer for me but then I think

1420
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:08,889
individuals in the design team should

1421
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:14,589
answer individually for them I think we

1422
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:16,900
should try for option two because I

1423
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:22,120
think that this is work that would

1424
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:24,400
benefit the area on the other hand I'm

1425
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:27,970
not getting the sense that there's a

1426
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:31,080
huge desperate desire to actually do the

1427
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:34,630
work from so option for does kind of

1428
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:39,550
tickle away anyone else design team you

1429
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:44,950
want to say something even brisk and I

1430
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:47,950
think it's actually in my opinion it's

1431
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:51,550
asking too much from design team the the

1432
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:55,660
topic is huge it's in my opinion net

1433
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:59,500
amount Stoica okay several volumes of

1434
01:20:55,660 --> 01:21:03,000
books so and basically to do it you

1435
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:18,040
either have to do it real seriously or

1436
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:21,070
you use option for hi rhetoric from with

1437
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,930
Jennifer's part of the design team I

1438
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:26,769
thought there was enough

1439
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:30,580
changes to review at least so that we

1440
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:32,410
can publish and zero zero draft partly

1441
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:34,950
they take the blame myself as well

1442
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:39,540
because part of the design team but I

1443
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:47,050
think we can deliver a zero zero version

1444
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:49,390
so I'm leaning to two or one pleading

1445
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:53,500
guilty as well in non-contributing

1446
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:57,940
efficiently as far as understood option

1447
01:21:53,500 --> 01:22:00,880
three looks quite pointless because you

1448
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:04,059
need to find replacing people on the

1449
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:08,140
first set of people failed to take the

1450
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:12,100
time I have afraid options really really

1451
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:14,160
quite fast to option for so for me

1452
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:18,130
between I'm one and two it's up to the

1453
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:27,730
leader but I agree with deserve a second

1454
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:30,700
chance to try one more or two first I'd

1455
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:42,790
vote for trying one or two before

1456
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:46,059
anything else obviously we'd like to see

1457
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:48,760
the work progress we charter because I

1458
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:53,460
think for a reason we don't really care

1459
01:22:48,760 --> 01:23:02,140
what cooling uses so whatever helps the

1460
01:22:53,460 --> 01:23:05,230
most productive I guess I'm not leaning

1461
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:08,950
into the mic enough sorry I was saying

1462
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:13,089
whichever tools the the team wants to

1463
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:17,740
use is their call so for me option one

1464
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:20,230
and to the I'm not sure the difference

1465
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:24,280
between reboot and rebirth if you get to

1466
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:27,790
choose your tool although that is the

1467
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:29,889
difference yes so the difference between

1468
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:31,690
one and two is if you'd like an internal

1469
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:33,730
thing for the team

1470
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:36,230
yeah I think I think the difference is

1471
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:38,780
eternal from my standpoint that's a tea

1472
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:41,179
decision whatever works for you guys so

1473
