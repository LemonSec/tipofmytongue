1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,489
started so if people could take their

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,490
seats I would appreciate it

3
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:26,990
so welcome everyone to the

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,848
administrative and operations plenary my

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,028
name is ELISA Cooper and I'm the chair

6
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:34,750
of the IETF and thank you for sticking

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,480
around for this portion of the plenary

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,550
so I didn't get to go outside during the

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,980
day yesterday but I heard that it that

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:48,349
it rained did anybody see a rainbow

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:51,679
yesterday no so we have a rainbow over

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:56,809
Montreal today I thought we could use

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,850
one so our agenda for today we're gonna

14
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,540
try to be quick so that we can get to

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,699
the open microphone sessions we'll have

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,490
a host presentation from our meeting

17
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,770
host here in Montreal and then brief

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,720
updates from myself

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,690
the IRT F chair the RFC series editor

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,830
the IV chair the ITF executive director

21
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:22,700
the ICF LLC board chair and the chair of

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,580
the NomCom we'll have a welcome from the

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,110
hosts from for IH f-106 our next meeting

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,670
and then we'll get to the open

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,690
microphone sessions and we're gonna time

26
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,790
limit the LLC board section and the ihe

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,460
section to ten minutes each so that we

28
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,760
have lots of time for the IAB open mic

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,559
and I think as people who were reading

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,040
the mailing list earlier today may have

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,380
seen based on requirements from the

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,650
hotel we are have to be out of this room

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,170
at 9:00 p.m. so we're gonna have to cut

34
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,880
ourselves off then unfortunately but

35
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,260
we'll try to be quick in this early part

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,699
so we have lots of time at the end so

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,430
first of all I'd like to extend a big

38
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,700

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,510
we can't put on these meetings without

41
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,680
the support of the host and as an

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,799

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,570
looking forward to going back to

65
00:03:40,490 --> 00:04:03,739
Philadelphia we haven't been there in a

66
00:03:41,570 --> 00:04:08,450
long time so thank you Glenn alright so

67
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:10,519
moving on to my report three topics

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,369
today the first will spend a moment on

69
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,989
participant statistics for this meeting

70
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,510
talk a little bit about our ongoing

71
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,220
experiment with open time in the meeting

72
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:24,890
agenda I'll talk a little bit about

73
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:29,229
conduct in the IETF so here you can see

74
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:33,190
our usual statistics for participation

75
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:35,419
at 1079 people on site at this meeting

76
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,430
eerily similar to the number of people

77
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:41,359
we had on site in Montreal last summer

78
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,150
we had 1,000 78 people on site so quite

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,250
consistent not sure that was a goal but

80
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,830
we achieved it

81
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,430
we had 147 first-time attendees pretty

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:58,640
good number and participants from 48

83
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:00,410
countries here this time we started off

84
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,320
the week with the IETF hackathon on

85
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,270
Saturday and Sunday 280 on-site

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,700
attendees so this is our second largest

87
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,560
hackathon ever not as not as big as the

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,620
one in Prague last time but but still a

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,120
fantastic turnout people working on 42

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,130
different projects it's become

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,250
essentially a staple of the ITF meeting

92
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,330
week for a good chunk of our population

93
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,770
we had to hack them on happy hour on

94
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,950
Monday night where people got to

95
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,960
advertise their projects and spend a

96
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,640
little bit more time talking in depth

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,039
with other participants about what they

98
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,688
had accomplished and the next one will

99
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,179
be happening the Saturday and

100
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:43,039
Sunday of the next IETF meeting November

101
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:45,589
16 and 17 in Singapore so the open time

102
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,659
the open agenda time experiment people

103
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:49,039
may realize that we're we've been doing

104
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:51,979
different versions of this experiment

105
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,808
for the last few meetings at the last

106
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,449
meeting we had open agenda time on

107
00:05:53,809 --> 00:06:00,649
Wednesday afternoon had a big chunk of

108
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:20,809
open time and based on survey feedback

109
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:28,519
from the IETF 104 meetings survey ok now

110
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:30,889
we're not giving people seizures so

111
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,429
after every meeting we do a survey based

112
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,349
on the survey feedback from last time it

113
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:39,888
was obvious that most people were more

114
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,300
interested in more shorter slots of open

115
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,309
time spread throughout the week as

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,349
opposed to one long open slot on

117
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:47,449
Wednesday afternoon so that's what we

118
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:49,909
tried at this meeting we've had open

119
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:53,179
time every morning from 8:30 to 9:45

120
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,949
with unofficial side meeting rooms that

121
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,078
people can sign up for on a first-come

122
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,459
first-served basis and we had the

123
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,819
working group session starting at 10:00

124
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:03,469
o'clock in the morning even with this

125
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,479
amount of open time in the schedule we

126
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:07,248
still had plenty of slots to accommodate

127
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,550
the number of working groups and working

128
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:12,110
group sessions that wanted to meet in

129
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,369
order to figure out what we're gonna do

130
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,809
next and if we're going to repeat this

131
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,329
experiment or change it we need more

132
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,669
feedback so when you get the email on

133
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:21,679
the 105 attendees list about the meeting

134
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,599
survey which will be going out hopefully

135
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:25,729
at the end of this week please fill it

136
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,709
out please give us your feedback what

137
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,869
you thought of this agenda whether you

138
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,489
liked the 10 o'clock start how you think

139
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:33,949
we should be structuring open time in

140
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:35,209
the future and any other feedback that

141
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,589
you have about how we can make the

142
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:40,129
meeting experience better for you and

143
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:41,990
more productive for you you can also

144
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,309
send feedback to the IHG directly if you

145
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,300
don't feel like filling out the survey

146
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:53,160
is G at IETF dot org

147
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,540
we hosted hot RFC on Sunday evening so

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,789
this is a two-hour session which is

149
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,490
filled with lightning talks designed to

150
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:01,409
encourage brainstorming help people find

151
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,449
collaborators raise awareness about new

152
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,270
ideas new drafts new initiatives in the

153
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,699
ITF promote side meetings and Barb offs

154
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,758
there were 23 talks and the proceedings

155
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,750
are available online again this is one

156
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,120
of those events that seems to be

157
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,419
becoming a fixture of the IETF meeting

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:28,650
week and a very big thanks to Erin for

159
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:29,760
continuing to organize it so capably so

160
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,609
I wanted to spend a couple of minutes

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,860
talking about conduct in the IETF

162
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,580
there's been lots of discussion on the

163
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,430
IETF mailing the main ITF mailing list

164
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,440
about this recently and lots of

165
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,560
discussion over the last few meeting

166
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,140
cycles dating back to ITF the IGF 103

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,459
plenary that we had at the end of last

168
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:56,839
year we have guidelines for conduct in

169
00:08:53,459 --> 00:09:00,449
the ITF they're enshrined in BCP 54 and

170
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,700
this is just kind of the top line from

171
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,950
that RFC it says that the ITF strives

172
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,450
through these guidelines for conduct to

173
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,890
create and maintain an environment in

174
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,160
which every person is treated with

175
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,199
dignity dignity decency and respect I

176
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,270
think there's actually a few notable

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,110
things about even just this one sentence

178
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:22,020
in particular this word strives because

179
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,060
I think the notion of creating a

180
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,089
positive and enriching culture in the

181
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,130
ITF it's not really like a box checking

182
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,839
exercise it's more of a journey and it's

183
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,550
probably a journey that we will always

184
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,450
be on it doesn't really have an endpoint

185
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,400
I think for some people they've noted

186
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,959
some particularly troubling interactions

187
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,140
on our mailing lists lately and some

188
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,750
even more troubling interactions off-off

189
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,010
lists recently and so it might be that

190
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,740
we're at a particularly challenging

191
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:53,100
moment in this journey for me I think

192
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,470
that means it's an opportunity to for

193
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,890
all of us to think about what we can do

194
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,450
to course-correct to make improvements

195
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,920
to learn from our mistakes

196
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,000
I know that there's certainly things

197
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,069
that I can do better and there's

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,380
mistakes that I've made I might talk a

199
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,370
little bit about those in a few slides

200
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,300
but I suspect that there's things that

201
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,500
we can do collectively as well the IHG

202
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,680
talked about this a little bit this

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,399
morning and we feel as the leadership a

204
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,680
responsibility both for the toxic

205
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,019
atmosphere that can sometimes arise and

206
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,939
for trying to make improvements on the

207
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:33,570
situation so we're taking this very

208
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:35,220
seriously it's been revelatory even for

209
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,560
me these last few weeks to try to

210
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,139
understand the the full scope of all of

211
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,060
the documents that we have that describe

212
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,269
conduct in the IDF and there are

213
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,790
actually a lot of them and they go back

214
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,589
a long time this is not a new

215
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,959
conversation this is a conversation that

216
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:56,370
the ITF has been having for at least 20

217
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:58,920
years if not longer and these policies

218
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,410
are not necessarily in harmony once you

219
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,060
go and take a look at them so if we go

220
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,760
back to some of the earlier ones the

221
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,880
earliest ones we have working group

222
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,490
guidelines and procedures which in one

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,040
section talk about working group chairs

224
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,140
being able to intervene to cut off

225
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,730
disruptive behavior both in working

226
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,800
group sessions and on working group

227
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,579
mailing lists and the original RFC for

228
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,760
that dates in 1999 then we have the ITF

229
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:29,880
discussion list charter RFC 1305 which

230
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,860
was written in the year 2000 and that

231
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,300
one talks about inappropriate postings

232
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,070
on the ITF mailing lists and

233
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,699
specifically about unprofessional

234
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,839
commentary and that's the one that

235
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:41,880
create created this role of

236
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,500
sergeant-at-arms and allows the ITF

237
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,899
chair to designate people to serve as

238
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,529
sergeant's at arm's who can help to

239
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:51,360
moderate conduct on the ITF mailing list

240
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:54,839
then we have one about revoking mailing

241
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,670
list privileges from 2004 which is

242
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,209
focused on denial of service attacks

243
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,010
that disrupt the consensus process on

244
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,660
the mailing list and in that case it's

245
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,889
the iesg which is responsible for

246
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,779
enforcing that one we have the

247
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,610
guidelines for conduct which I cited at

248
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,529
the beginning originally published in

249
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,089
2001 that document was Oxley

250
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,509
by a version that was written five years

251
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,839
ago and this one is more of the has the

252
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,670
more of the positive valence talks about

253
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,009
the aspirational what we you know what

254
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,949
we aspire to extending respect and

255
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,329
courtesy to our colleagues and that one

256
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,839
doesn't really have any enforcement

257
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:35,339
mechanism or or personnel then a couple

258
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,720
of years ago we did the anti harassment

259
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,259
policy and the anti harassment

260
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,809
procedures and that one is more focused

261
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,370
on unwelcome hostile or intimidating

262
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:47,550
behavior actually goes into some great

263
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,680
detail of defining what behavior that

264
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,969
constitutes and that's the one that

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,160
created the role of Ombuds team to field

266
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,100
confidential complaints about behavior

267
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,420
among individuals and then last thing we

268
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,910
have also the meeting photography new

269
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,050
policy which is the newest one which is

270
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,329
about which has a section which is about

271
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,709
ad hoc photography in the ITF and how

272
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:13,050
people can can decline to be

273
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,729
photographed if they want to be so I

274
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,829
think that's kind of a summary of all of

275
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,480
the policies that we have about conduct

276
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:24,180
in the ITF there's been some recent

277
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,100
activity to try to stimulate a more

278
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,800
positive environment and there's also a

279
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,589
few ideas floating around just this week

280
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,599
and going past going back a few weeks

281
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:35,519
that I wanted to let people know about

282
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,199
so the first is discussion between area

283
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,360
directors and working group chairs about

284
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,579
encouraging professional behavior in the

285
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,769
working groups this goes back to IETF

286
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,529
103 when we had a significant plenary

287
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,730
discussion about this and the ISD has

288
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,149
been engaging with the working group

289
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,189
chairs since then to try to figure out

290
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:55,319
some guy some guidance essentially to

291
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,689
help working group chairs feel empowered

292
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,339
to intervene when they see bad behavior

293
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:01,740
and their working groups and to try to

294
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,500
encourage people to to be polite and

295
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,290
respectful so that's something that the

296
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,429
area directors are socializing

297
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,439
essentially one-to-one with their

298
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,720
working group chairs we really wanted to

299
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:14,550
do this on a human level is a

300
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,350
person-to-person conversation with with

301
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,939
the chairs and it's also something that

302
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,079
we as area directors ourselves are are

303
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:23,429
using for introspection and thinking

304
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,969
about how we're applying this principle

305
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,360
when we engage in the IETF we've gotten

306
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,430
some as

307
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,290
since from professional resources so

308
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,579
there was a group of us who met earlier

309
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,110
this week with an engineering

310
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:39,300
engineering manager who's responsible

311
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,740
for positive community building at one

312
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,260
of the organizations that participates

313
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,180
in the IETF and he provided an

314
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,790
incredible wealth of insight about

315
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,529
things that we could do he had read two

316
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,089
months worth of our mailing list so he

317
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,890
was well educated about some of what's

318
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,529
going on here and I think we may

319
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,449
continue to rely on his guidance and

320
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,089
potentially seek some other contacts

321
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,519
from him to help us you know develop

322
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,230
what we do here we're also thinking

323
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,959
about training in combination with that

324
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,240
potentially leveraging some professional

325
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,579
assistance to do training for the

326
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,690
working group chairs for the leadership

327
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:14,880
possibly for others who might be

328
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,399
interested in some training about how to

329
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,079
handle specific situations you know

330
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,810
maybe some roleplay so I'm thinking

331
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,979
about particular scenarios that that can

332
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:28,469
get tricky in the ITF there's been some

333
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,550
activity around rotating the sergeant's

334
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:34,920
at arm's so a couple of years ago in in

335
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,769
May of 2017 we got two new sergeants of

336
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,990
arms after the previous set had served

337
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:43,920
about ten years it's time for a refresh

338
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,290
so at that time Matt Miller and Ben

339
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,260
Caidic agreed to become new sergeant's

340
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,849
at arm's for the ITF discussion list

341
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,189
people may know Ben Caidic as the

342
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,050
security ad he was actually the sergeant

343
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,579
at arms first before he became the

344
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,469
security ad so if you don't want to be a

345
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,849
security ad you might want to think

346
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,199
about not becoming a sergeant at arms

347
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,920
because apparently that's the thing that

348
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:08,010
happens but basically since Ben joined

349
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,180
the iesg last year he's been asking me

350
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,610
to replace him and it has not been the

351
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,390
highest priority on my list for a few

352
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,430
reasons

353
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:21,180
there were other things going on as one

354
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:22,170
of those reasons but also it never

355
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,269
really seemed like a burning issue

356
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,010
because we have two sergeants at arms

357
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:28,890
so if there ever seemed like there was a

358
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,029
situation where where it didn't it

359
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,550
wouldn't seem correct for Ben to

360
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,240
intervene then we always had Matt and of

361
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,599
course myself

362
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,270
I'm also empowered by RC 3005 to to try

363
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,260
to help with the ITF discussion list so

364
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,210
as many things in the ITF

365
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,330
didn't seem like something that could

366
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:49,210
turn into a burning fire until it

367
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:52,360
ignited which I think it sort of has

368
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,740
recently so um in the process of looking

369
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,870
for a new sergeant-at-arms

370
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,030
that's already started I've done some

371
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,890
outreach on that front already and hope

372
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:04,060
to be able to do that fairly soon

373
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,310
another thing that I think we could do

374
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,720
that's maybe demonstrated by the the

375
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,730
litany of policies that I went through

376
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,730
earlier is to try to streamline some of

377
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,790
the documentation that we have how we

378
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,650
talk about conduct in the IETF there's

379
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,690
quite a bit of discrepancy between all

380
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,000
the various documents in how we talk

381
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,920
about it and so bringing some harmony to

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,760
that that set of concepts might be

383
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,440
useful and then finally something that

384
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,990
the sergeant-at-arms have talked about

385
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,240
this week and I think the working group

386
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,490
chairs may have as well is clarifying

387
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,670
some of the escalation procedures so in

388
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,870
the past it's been somewhat ad hoc as to

389
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,560
you know if you see bad behavior on a

390
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,540
mailing list do you email off list first

391
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,919
do you how do you send the signal to the

392
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,250
rest of the community that something's

393
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,510
being dealt with off list at least I'm

394
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,490
on the sergeant's at arm's it's been

395
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,800
someone ad hoc like if we had already

396
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,740
sent a general warning on list then

397
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,090
maybe we would carry forward on list but

398
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,950
it hasn't been consistent in every case

399
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:06,159
and I think that's quite problematic and

400
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,680
that's that's on us to fix so that's I

401
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,450
think something that that we can try to

402
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,370
do across the board in terms of being

403
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,470
more clear about what the escalation

404
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,449
procedures are for all these different

405
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,520
bodies that that handle conduct in the

406
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,750
IETF so those are just some things that

407
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,220
have been going on and some other

408
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,680
potential new ideas

409
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,080
the IAS G very much wants to hear ideas

410
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,330
from you about what else we can do how

411
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,120
we can how we can be better on this so I

412
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:34,990
encourage your feedback either sent to

413
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,969
the IHG email alias to myself come to

414
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,840
the mic during the open mic we really

415
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,600
want to hear your ideas there's a bunch

416
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,730
more information covered online in the

417
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,080
ITF chairs report and other reports from

418
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,110
various other bodies so I encourage you

419
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:54,179
to check that out

420
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,179
and colin perkins is next

421
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,699
okay

422
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,860
Thank You Alyssa my name is Colin

423
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,260
Perkins I'm the IRT F chair I just want

424
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:27,169
to give a very brief report on the RT F

425
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:30,230
so the IRT F is a parallel log as an

426
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:32,990
organization to the IETF which focuses

427
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,710
on the some of the long term research

428
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:39,410
issues relating to the intimate

429
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,800
importantly the goal of the I RTF is

430
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,810
explicitly not to seek to develop or

431
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,000
influence the standards process rather

432
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,010
we try to promote research which is

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,020
relevant to the to the long term

434
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,110
evolution of the Internet and we do this

435
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,520
in the form of various research groups

436
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,959
the applied networking research prize

437
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,090
and the applied networking research

438
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:07,250
workshop we've tried to bring academics

439
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:09,350
into the ITF we have 11 fully chartered

440
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,440
research groups three proposed research

441
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,600
groups six of these are still to meet

442
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,570
later in the week we have the crypto

443
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,909
forum research group the computation in

444
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,980
the network proposed research group the

445
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,740
network management group the network

446
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,940
coding group half aware networking and

447
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,330
the measurement and analysis of

448
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,890
protocols are finishing up on Friday if

449
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,960
you're interested in any of these topics

450
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,480
please do get you go along we've had

451
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,480
some really good research groups earlier

452
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,450
in the week the the privacy enhancements

453
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,160
group in particular earlier today had a

454
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:48,440
bunch of stuff which was very relevant

455
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:51,020
to the technical plenary talks in

456
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,300
addition to the research groups we run

457
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,830
an academic conference called the

458
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,870
applied networking research workshop

459
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:59,570
which we organized in collaboration with

460
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,610
ACM sitcom this took place earlier this

461
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,610
week on the Monday we had about 200

462
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,649
people attending the workshop really

463
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,050
nice set of papers which are all up

464
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,390
online we're hoping to do this again

465
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:14,270
next year at the summer ITF in Madrid

466
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,950
next summer look out for the call for

467
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:20,360
papers just after Christmas most likely

468
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,850
finally we also run the applied

469
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,949
networking research prize this is a

470
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,959
prize awarded for recent

471
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,720
research results in applied networking

472
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,050
research which are relevant to bringing

473
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,450
into the a IETF the IETF community we

474
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:37,610
are two really nice talks yesterday met

475
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,880
Sir Rosen chef gave a talk on NTP

476
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,070
security with paper on a protocol on

477
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,220
implementation of NTP called Chronos and

478
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,710
CJ Chung give it a really nice talk on

479
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,410
the role of registers and DNS SEC

480
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,810
deployments we'll have a couple more of

481
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,850
these price talks at the next IETF in

482
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,550
Singapore and in addition the

483
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,949
nominations for the 2020 applied

484
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,440
networking research price will open in

485
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,230
September October time frame so if you

486
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,030
know of any good applied networking

487
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,970
research papers please

488
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,470
look out for the call for nominations

489
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,110
and let us know so we can we can bring

490
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,690
those people into the the IETF the IRT f

491
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:25,429
community next year

492
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:27,790
thank you did you come and next we have

so you know what I'm gonna ask right

496
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:51,730
I've been working on this RFC format

497
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:58,360
project for a little while is this new

498
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:59,620
new to anybody here okay good um in case

499
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,990
this is a first meeting for you and

500
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,909
you're not familiar with this I have

501
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,800
been working with with the community

502
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,730
with the RFC production center with

503
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,710
really just about anybody I can on

504
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,230
taking us from the plaintext ask you

505
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:20,520
only rfcs that we've been using for the

506
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:23,920
last 40-plus years to XML as the the

507
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,250
unchanging underlying format and having

508
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:31,030
outputs of text PDF a3 is our rifle

509
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,980
target and HTML allowing SVG lineart in

510
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,040
black and white no we're not going to do

511
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:40,230
color because color is thinking hard and

512
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:43,240
allowing non ASCII characters there is a

513
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,980
FAQ sort of a very high-level FAQ on the

514
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,540
project available on the RFC editor

515
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,730
website and I'm we're now at that sort

516
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:55,240
of that last little bit of aligning

517
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,290
parts but the RSC production Center is

518
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,320
is targeting the end of August this year

519
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:05,920
not this this August to try and be ready

520
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,610
to be ready to publish v3 documents now

521
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,010
whether the tools will be ready rather

522
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:14,080
the ndn process will be ready there's

523
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,420
still a couple of open questions about

524
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,050
some details in the vocabulary whether

525
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,600
all of that will finally align is a

526
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:25,540
definitive maybe but I'm still very much

527
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,580
hoping that we'll see we'll see the

528
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,330
capabilities available come end of

529
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:33,040
August I want everyone to expect that

530
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,260
this is going to introduce several

531
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,909
months of debugging

532
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,670
as we all learn some new and interesting

533
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:42,250
features and what to expect out of the

534
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,590
new format and it's going to increase

535
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,720
the workload for pretty much everybody

536
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,679
involved for the authors who have more

537
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,690
things to review

538
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,310
for the editors within the RSC

539
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,130
production center who also have a lot

540
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:57,040
more things to review there's a couple

541
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,810
of key links on these slides and if you

542
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,730
as I told the working group chairs today

543
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,980
if you take nothing else away from my

544
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,790
talk I'd really like you to be looking

545
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,550
at the XML to RFC v3 FAQ it answers a

546
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,230
lot of questions that people come to the

547
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,110
desk and ask about and I think it will

548
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,400
help you and and your authors and your

549
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,780
doc Shepherds and really just about

550
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,430
everybody to understand what's going on

551
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,260
a couple other really quick things that

552
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,440
I'll jump through since I know we are

553
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,420
tight on time last time I mentioned the

554
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,590
service level agreement that with the

555
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,540
increased workload

556
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,740
it was extremely unlikely that we would

557
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:39,070
be meeting that later this year now the

558
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,780
LLC board has approved temporarily two

559
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,409
additional editors and we're still

560
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,000
searching for those as it turns out the

561
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:48,550
type of copy editors that the RFC

562
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,070
production center needs to edit IETF

563
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:53,950
documents are rather specialized beasts

564
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,330
and it's a little challenging to to find

565
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,810
folks that will be a good fit but we're

566
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,659
still working on that because because

567
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:04,350
the gods are unkind cluster 238 is

568
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,970
expected to be releasing right about now

569
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:09,459
the last two documents are scheduled for

570
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,800
the IES D I used to tell a chat on

571
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:18,120
August 8th and that will drop about

572
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:21,430
2,000 pages into cube things so

573
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,010
implementation expected in q3 we are

574
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,860
requesting a formal exception to the

575
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:30,370
service level agreement for q3 and q4 to

576
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:33,129
just recognize that it's pretty obvious

577
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,899
as we are as we the RFC editor are the

578
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:38,140
primary testers at this point in putting

579
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,580
so much time into this we're not going

580
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,960
to get through the editing of pages so

581
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,429
let's acknowledge that we can't really

582
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,470
say here's how much time it will take

583
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,700
because the tools are still in process

584
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,290
we just don't know so hopefully that the

585
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,510
goal is to just understand that reality

586
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:59,500
get that documented for future reference

587
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:01,989
and move on I have been sending out

588
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,090
satisfaction surveys

589
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:06,879
the whole purpose of that is vendor

590
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:10,149
evaluation and as probably no big

591
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:14,498
surprise the we don't get a lot of

592
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:16,418
response about 17% response rate almost

593
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,799
everybody has been very happy with the

594
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,570
RFC editor I think we've gotten one

595
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:25,450
response that said well it was okay but

596
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:27,519
it would be better if you use github so

597
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,409
in terms of the narrative trends because

598
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,960
they're sort of just this open space of

599
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:34,059
if you could do one thing to improve

600
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,950
this you know what what would you see

601
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:40,178
done really the one thing that we hear

602
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:43,690
consistently is improve off 48 now what

603
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:45,549
improve off 48 means pretty much I think

604
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,720
every individual who's ever put

605
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:48,580
something through the queue has a

606
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,730
different opinion on what that means so

607
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,549
this is a really big project and I

608
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:57,639
highly recommend that this be sort of

609
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,109
the the priority for where we're my

610
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:01,570
biggest priority I ended up being in

611
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:03,189
terms of projects the format work I

612
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,259
think this is your next big thing that

613
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,350
you should pay attention to to relieve

614
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:11,289
this particular friction from the RSC

615
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,639
publication process and um someone did

616
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,739
say that more chocolate would be helpful

617
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:20,559
just just noting that one wanted to note

618
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:23,649
that there is a projects if those of you

619
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,168
who are following tools that may know

620
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:27,820
about the inline errata project code has

621
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:30,279
been written by soaring hot consulting

622
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,119
that's Jim shod to create files with

623
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,769
erotic Corrections in line verified only

624
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,840
this is very sandbox II and we're doing

625
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:40,869
everything we can to highlight the fact

626
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,408
that no you can't refer to these as the

627
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:46,449
final document but enough people find

628
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,999
this to be just useful implementation

629
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,460
help that we want to make that available

630
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:55,059
so that's that's something that's

631
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,340
happening now I do have a call for

632
00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:00,100
comment open this is the 50th year that

633
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,230
RFC's have been published and so as

634
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,730
there was a 30 years of our FCS and a 40

635
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,869
years of our FCS there's 50 year of

636
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:12,639
RFC's out there and it is waiting for

637
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:15,230
your review and your comment elephant in

638
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:17,870
the room the RFC series editor society

639
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:21,200
not to renew contract at the end of 2019

640
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,639
I thought it would be just it was fun to

641
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,080
put together a what what have we

642
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,820
accomplished because it wasn't just me

643
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,740
it was this room it was the a RFC

644
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,889
production center and we've done we've

645
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,750
done some pretty major things every year

646
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,190
since I started we've got and finally

647
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,630
gotten a new website I don't know if you

648
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,429
all some of you might remember the old

649
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:43,580
website that was a little disappointing

650
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:46,429
for a technical organization to offer a

651
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,470
stye updating a style guide which we had

652
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:50,840
been working against the draft on for a

653
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,669
very long time getting digital object

654
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,970
identifiers assigned this was very

655
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:58,730
important in particular to the IRT F

656
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,890
going through the RFP process to award

657
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:04,340
the RFC production Center in publisher

658
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:07,000
RFPs be getting the format

659
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,370
specifications published and sorted out

660
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,840
developing digital archive partnerships

661
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:15,049
digital archiving is actually a pretty

662
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,360
specialized field and it wasn't while

663
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:19,910
that is one of the key reasons that the

664
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,040
RFC editor exists to maintain the

665
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,200
archive of this material ongoing in the

666
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,690
future it's not really our area of

667
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,400
specialty so we've partnered with the

668
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,400
commuter Computer History Museum and

669
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,890
with the National Library in Sweden to

670
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,660
just keep ingesting our documents and

671
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:39,740
make sure we have other ways that they

672
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,360
can be stored in perpetuity and the new

673
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,919
RFC format rolling out this year I

674
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,709
really wanted to thank you all so very

675
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,730
much for making this less happen I

676
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,900
greatly appreciate your time

677
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:57,599
[Applause]

678
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:57,599
[Music]

679
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,119
[Music]

680
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,879
Thank You Julie thank you now um some of

681
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:21,310
you may have questions about some of

682
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,400
what I put together and rather than have

683
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:27,010
them lost in what might be some some

684
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,260
engaging conversation later we've got a

685
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,410
couple minutes if anyone has any any

686
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:36,850
open mic questions they want to ask me

687
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:38,260
now would be a good time Michael

688
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,939
Richardson I'm really excited about the

689
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,250
inline errata stuff since I'm dealing

690
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,420
with router right now but I was a bit

691
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,650
dismayed when you told me we cannot

692
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,870
compel the reference I know I do not

693
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,810
want to see those as the key reference

694
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,860
pointer within an RFC no I think that's

695
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,320
a bad idea

696
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,689
but I get a URL I can point people at oh

697
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,460
those URLs you can you can talk about it

698
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,830
you can use it but when you start going

699
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,870
in your your RFC and say okay my

700
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:16,510
normative reference is foo you're not

701
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:26,939
going to point to that got it okay okay

702
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:26,940
thank you very much Ted

703
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,460
[Music]

704
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,090
so as you know one of the things the a

705
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,530
stands for disappointments in this case

706
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,300
we wanted to let the community you know

707
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,870
that Russ Hasley and Barry liebe would

708
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,399
be reappointed to the CCG that Richard

709
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,020
Barnes will serve a second term on the

710
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,120
ice awkward thank you for service there

711
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,750
and that Jim Reed has been reappointed

712
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,030
to the I can or zurk the last thing on

713
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,130
the appointment slide is that the ad is

714
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,879
also currently seeking feedback on the

715
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,590
ITF delegate to the ICANN 2020 NomCom

716
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,420
the previous person was timed out so

717
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:20,189
these are all new candidates please do

718
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:22,800
take a look on the document side RC 85

719
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,120
46 and RC 8558 we're sure during this

720
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,590
period we actually talked about them in

721
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,689
the draft stage and last one so I'm not

722
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,939
going to them as Heather just pointed

723
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:34,140
out 50 years of our C's is currently in

724
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,730
community commentary there's also some

725
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,980
other ones the harmful consequences of

726
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,230
the robustness principle the principles

727
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,760
for operation of a a Anna registries

728
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,310
that one in particular is just an update

729
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,650
to deal with VI asset changes so please

730
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:49,290
don't assume that there's a major change

731
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,940
in operation there and lastly document

732
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:54,780
on the long-term viability of protocol

733
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,250
extension medicines both the stack

734
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,899
evolution and privacy and security

735
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,460
programs have been operating for a

736
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,520
number of years and they have fulfilled

737
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,650
their basic goals each of them was an

738
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,900
evolution of a previous set of programs

739
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,760
and our current plan is to conclude both

740
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,679
of those in the near future and then

741
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,310
carry out any future work in other

742
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,100
programs or structures just like know

743
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:21,330
there were two workshops in the recent

744
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:24,299
timeframe DDR Tedder was hosted by Nokia

745
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:26,040
in Finland in June and a bunch of the

746
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,040
expressions on it all the papers are

747
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,570
online please feel free to take a look

748
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,918
among the ones that we think are most

749
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,870
pressing or really that the

750
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,480
architectural changes in find moving

751
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:38,370
functionality up the stack mean that

752
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,469
we're likely to see changes in

753
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,418
deployment patterns that result in

754
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:45,750
consolidation and centralization those

755
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:47,250
in turn create fragility and other kinds

756
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,310
of concerns you heard some one security

757
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:53,418
concerns earlier today the escape

758
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:56,159
workshop which has got a long acronym

759
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:58,319
was hosted at Cisco last week and it was

760
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,670
discussing web packaging and other

761
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,010
options in the space of web content

762
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,570
distribution with a particular emphasis

763
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,460
on the secondary effects on those

764
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,320
mechanisms and again consolidation is a

765
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,240
concern here and one of the reasons that

766
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,130
this was put together was to make sure

767
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,740
that the technical community actually

768
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,630
heard from the publisher community which

769
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,459
is often not a group that comes here to

770
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:24,900
the ITF as you know the IAB is also

771
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,760
chartered as a committee of the Internet

772
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,710
Society is an advisory committee to the

773
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,720
board and we have been consulting with

774
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,120
them on a number of things in particular

775
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,490
again on consolidation matter that was

776
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:39,210
raised in the Internet Society in the

777
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:41,459
global internet report so the last slide

778
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,710
on this builds on what heather was

779
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,470
saying earlier about the RFC centered

780
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,290
series editor search first we regret

781
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,180
that we're having to do a search we want

782
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,680
to make sure that we engage in an open

783
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,359
discussion with you on how we can move

784
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,509
forward there's a lot of time at the end

785
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,000
of this for that but as noted in a

786
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,910
conversation with John cleanse in' and

787
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,380
again with brian carpenter later we

788
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,879
don't think that that conversation is

789
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,760
going to end tonight there are other

790
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,950
people who can't be in this room with us

791
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,380
either for Geographic reasons time

792
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,750
reasons or because they're parts of

793
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,000
communities who are customers rather

794
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,800
than authors of RFC's and it will take

795
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,050
some time to carry out that conversation

796
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,510
there is however a time critical

797
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,860
decision to be made on whether to go

798
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,950
ahead with the recruitment of a newer

799
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:32,160
rse to facilitate the discussion on what

800
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,020
changes might be made and in particular

801
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,460
to be present in the system until

802
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,580
community discussion on the larger

803
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:42,720
issues may have concluded the other

804
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,340
possibility there is to leave the RFP

805
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,169
unissued for a period of time while the

806
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,120
community discussion goes forward and

807
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,430
one of the things that we're hoping to

808
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,230
do is have a bit of discussion tonight

809
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,359
to kick off that particular time

810
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,850
critical part of it

811
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,790
Olaf Copeland who served as the acting

812
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:02,670
RSC earlier and is one of the two

813
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,420
editors of the currently governing

814
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:08,700
document 66 35 will present a very short

815
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,960
review of the current model for those of

816
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,509
you who may not understand how the

817
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,600
different moving parts work together and

818
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,340
some of it is pretty complicated and we

819
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,890
hope then to use the Open Mic time

820
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:56,720
productively to see how we can make this

821
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:59,879
go better in the future thank you as

822
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,310
Alissa mentioned I'd like to thank our

823
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,120
global host and host for this meeting

824
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:09,029
Comcast and NBCUniversal and we

825
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:12,120
definitely appreciate our host for this

826
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:22,830
meeting and the social last night thank

827
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:31,520
you very much and our Braun sponsor is

828
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:34,770
Verisign for this meeting thank you and

829
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:45,560
certainly connectivity sponsors Metro

830
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:48,210
optic open facing tellus and of course

831
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,110
we couldn't hold the meeting without the

832
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:54,540
equipment and I'm sure God you all had a

833
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:57,450
chance to make it to the Hoff earlier

834
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,490
but it's that equipment that it's

835
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:02,129
donated other sponsors that really make

836
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:04,500
it make each meeting

837
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,690
I'm seamless because the meaning the

838
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,610
equipment is taken from one place or the

839
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:12,740
other and it just makes a big difference

840
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:15,750
in how the Internet is coming into um

841
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,770
into the venue and in particular for

842

843
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:25,849
donated new MX 204 routers and I'd like

844
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,759

[Music]

894
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:13,569
Porcia next we have Jason thank you very

895
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:17,079
much Alisa

896
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:19,199
so we've gotten a lot done so we've been

897
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,929
in place now for four months and

898
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,150
bootstrapping an organization is always

899
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:27,160
fun and there's a lot of work activity

900
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,839
the beginning and we're in that highly

901
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,229
intensive phase so I have a bunch of

902
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:35,288
updates to provide first who was on the

903
00:43:32,229 --> 00:43:38,348
board you'll see some of us on the stage

904
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,749
Peter later on Peter is remote so you'll

905
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:43,329
see him on the video screen and Maya is

906
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:45,788
here as well in addition of course to

907
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:48,279
ELISA and Sean from the community you

908
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:50,140
may not recognize Sean he doesn't have a

909
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:53,559
beard I have to say I'm still freaked

910
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,679
out by that so it's a sort of a problem

911
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,419
off to work through it we are in terms

912
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:00,309
of the meeting schedule we're trying to

913
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:01,868
do a couple things here first we're

914
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:03,909
trying to provide a lot more advance

915
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,409
notice of when we're meeting and then

916
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,179
what we're going to be working on so

917
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,559
we're doing a lot better in terms of

918
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:11,079
publishing an advance schedule of

919
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,390
meetings and of course agendas we're

920
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,799
working to get better there so that's

921
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,989
one of the improvements that community

922
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:18,939
asked for we've gotten a lot of work

923
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:21,849
done so we had a two-day board meeting

924
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:24,009
in May to kick everything off we did

925
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:25,689
some assessments to basically look at

926
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:27,309
our strengths and weaknesses as an

927
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:29,078
organization and the external

928
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:31,179
environment and how it may affect the

929
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,339
ITF in the long term and how we want to

930
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:37,449
mitigate those risks to the extent there

931
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:39,609
are any we issued a bunch of RFPs we

932
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:41,469
began a search for an executive director

933
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:43,839
and I'll give detailed updates on some

934
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:45,640
of these later we put in place a whole

935
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,189
bunch of insurance coverages that are

936
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:51,009
required and that we're also recommended

937
00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:53,078
we began a policy consultation process

938
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:56,039
and created a consultation process as

939
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,079
well of course we had the unexpected

940
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,939
export regulation thing come up and so

941
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,939
we had to deal with that on an ad-hoc

942
00:45:00,939 --> 00:45:05,649
basis and we've done some contract

943
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:07,989
extensions and I'll talk later about the

944
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:09,930
last item so in the next few months what

945
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:12,570
is the next few months look like for

946
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:15,330
we've got an executive director a

947
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:17,820
permanent one to put in place we need to

948
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,950
institute and finalize the policies that

949
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,100
we have and a bunch of other things that

950
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,419
are here it's a lot and so I'm going to

951
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,630
talk about some of the details in a

952
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,260
second this is the budget and where we

953
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,700
stand

954
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,310
all of these every time that we meet

955
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:35,069
every month we publish these suffice to

956
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,390
say basically we're on budget that's

957
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,460
really the key message here you don't

958
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,500
need to know much more for now the

959
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,820
budget process for 2020 is about to

960
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,530
begin

961
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,720
and I guess I would really say to the

962
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,340
interim board that preceded us thanks

963
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,709
for putting us in a good position and

964
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,110
thanks for I Sauk support and sponsor

965
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,090
support you know for basically putting

966
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,010
us on a firm footing for this year where

967
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,480
we don't feel like we've just formed and

968
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,510
we have to go ask for more money or

969
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,390
something like that so 2020 budgeting

970
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:05,010
will be important for us in terms of

971
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,220
operating reserve this has been talked

972
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:11,400
about before we have one that's good as

973
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:13,500
of now it's really invested in in

974
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,990
short-term instruments and so one of the

975
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,780
two new items or actions that we have is

976
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,520
to develop an investment policy strategy

977
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,030
to really guide what do we do with that

978
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,270
money

979
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,200
how much of it has to be in a short term

980
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:27,900
investment so you can get at it quickly

981
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,720
if you need to in an emergency versus

982
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:35,130
what can be invested in a more long term

983
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,890
basis in terms of the endowment this is

984
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:41,310
really new news so thank you to I sock

985
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:43,890
just days ago they were able to complete

986
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:46,680
the transition of the ietf endowment

987
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,660
from the Internet Society to the ITF and

988
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,549
that was a big deal took a lot of doing

989
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:53,009
on the part of I Sauk staff and we

990
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,330
really appreciate that I will say that

991
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,400
these numbers as you look at them

992
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,990
probably don't make much sense in some

993
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,910
cases they don't really quite add up

994
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,549
because of some of the oddities here and

995
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,040
I will sort of say the key here is that

996
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:06,540
the current balance is what's important

997
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,130
to pay attention to we have roughly

998
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,920
three million dollars in the endowment

999
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,990
and if our goal is to be able to fund

1000
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,210
annual operations out of the income

1001
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:17,370
generated by the in the endowment we

1002
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:19,560
have nowhere near enough money so we

1003
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:22,290
need to really in the next few months

1004
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,859
and the next year develop a strategy for

1005
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,259
how are we going to go about

1006
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:28,509
more funds for this endowment so that

1007
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:30,249
that might become a possibility and of

1008
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:33,819
course as well how should that money be

1009
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:35,379
invested over time similar to the the

1010
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:38,259
fund that we talked about a moment ago

1011
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,019
this reserved for the endowment itself

1012
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:42,489
we need an investment policy and at the

1013
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:44,078
at the current time we've really just

1014
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:46,829
mirrored how I sock had that money

1015
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,930
invested as a placeholder until we can

1016
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:51,460
get to focus on this so we've got a lot

1017
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,649
to do of course we reached out to the

1018
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,380
major donors and I think it's important

1019
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,759
to recognize their generosity so far

1020
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,710
that's really important both the

1021
00:47:57,759 --> 00:48:02,109
individual donors as well as the

1022
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:05,230
institutional organizations that backed

1023
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:07,720
the endowment and we appreciate that and

1024
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,519
we'll be working with them as we develop

1025
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,680
this sort of future strategy and

1026
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:15,669
figuring out what new organizations

1027
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,989
might be future donors for this the

1028
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:21,759
Secretariat services RFP we put that out

1029
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:23,559
obviously the current secretary that's

1030
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,420
been doing a fantastic job this meeting

1031
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:27,999
is another example of how smoothly

1032
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,739
everything just runs it's great it just

1033
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:32,230
sort of happens and works which is

1034
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:34,960
wonderful but we didn't happen to notice

1035
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,660
that the current contract ended first

1036
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,970
rather soon and also a matter of a few

1037
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,940
weeks before the next IDF meaning we

1038
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,558
thought that was sort of problematic and

1039
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,690
unnecessarily risky so we extended it to

1040
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,640
the end of the year and that gave us a

1041
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,499
little bit more time to issue the RFP

1042
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,140
the other thing that we're trying to do

1043
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:54,279
is to try to simplify overtime the way

1044
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,950
that some of the contracts are

1045
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:58,809
structured over time just as you know

1046
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,419
things happen a lot of things got

1047
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:03,640
bundled up into contracts and it can

1048
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,759
make things complicated to understand

1049
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,348
and so we've tried to break those up

1050
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:10,390
it's not any reflection that things are

1051
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:11,980
going badly in any sense it's just we're

1052
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:15,910
trying to simplify things and make them

1053
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:18,489
easier to manage and administer this was

1054
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:21,368
a big one so the search for a permanent

1055
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:23,739
executive director the key here is

1056
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:26,440
really astounding a hundred and

1057
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:28,660
thirty-four applications we were blown

1058
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,900
away by this we were very worried that

1059
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,879
we would have too few applicants and so

1060
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,450
from my standpoint I am incredibly

1061
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,820
humbled that we had 134 very carful

1062
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:41,259
I had applicants for this role and of

1063
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,230
that as we went through we had a very

1064
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:45,490
difficult time doing a first cut of

1065
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,530
those candidates to sort of pick the

1066
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:49,660
ones that should be interviewed in the

1067
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,940
first round and I think it's a great

1068
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,848
reflection on the strength of this

1069
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,010
community and what the ietf means to the

1070
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:59,170
Internet and to the world that so many

1071
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:01,990
highly qualified people so they're

1072
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:04,119
interested in this position and I think

1073
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,618
that's just a great thing it just means

1074
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,660
that in the short term for us we've got

1075
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:10,300
a lot of work to do to sort of sort

1076
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,848
through all of those candidates but it's

1077
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,400
amazing to me and I think we're again as

1078
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,960
I said really humbled by the level of

1079
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,190
interest in that and it's it's really

1080
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:24,070
great policies consultations so we began

1081
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,690
that in the early part of June and this

1082
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:27,250
was the first time that we did it so the

1083
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,200
first thing we did up front said what

1084
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,660
should our process look like for

1085
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,160
consultation this came out really in the

1086
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,899
eye asset to working group the

1087
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,118
expectations that the community had

1088
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,520
about how they wanted to be involved and

1089
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,839
consulted with and so we created a

1090
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,310
project on github that's where the

1091
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,529
documents went people could submit

1092
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:47,078
issues there if they wanted to we also

1093
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,450
created a general consultation email

1094
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,339
list and comments could go there we did

1095
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:53,169
a live webinar which was then recorded

1096
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:55,328
and available for people to watch later

1097
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:57,880
on and we began then a month-long

1098
00:50:55,329 --> 00:50:59,410
consultation period and where we stand

1099
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,180
now we've been a bit busy preparing for

1100
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,040
this meeting so we've collected a bunch

1101
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,020
of those things and over the coming

1102
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,240
weeks we'll be reviewing them and then

1103
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,910
deciding which of the policies need to

1104
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,520
be revised and whether those revisions

1105
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,319
get to a level of significance where we

1106
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,290
need to go out again for consultation

1107
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:20,259
and I don't think we know that yet and

1108
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:22,089
then as a last item not only do we then

1109
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,790
have to implement the policies but we

1110
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:26,619
have to put first meaningful training or

1111
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,810
information sharing about what those

1112
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:30,790
mean and how to comply with them but

1113
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:32,890
then sort of a checkup checkup

1114
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,779
compliance policy on the back end so

1115
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:37,060
that we're actually following those

1116
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,619
things which is important so I think

1117
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,500
those are all the updates here or other

1118
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:43,750
many many ways to follow us how to

1119
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,540
contact us and the stuff you can find us

1120
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:48,250
all online so no need to hash this out

1121
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,040
but those are the updates and will be up

1122
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:58,140
on stage later on to take any question

1123
00:51:51,040 --> 00:52:14,440
so thank you very much thank you Jason

1124
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:15,700
next we have Victor all right this will

1125
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,190
be a quick update on the NomCom

1126
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:21,399
committee that we're forming for this

1127
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:23,410
upcoming selection year first of all I

1128
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,230
like coming to Montreal in the summer

1129
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:28,089
it's a much nicer time of year and it's

1130
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:30,190
a nice place to gather for the first

1131
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,710
time with the new committee sorry the

1132
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:35,130
NomCom we we've got our NomCom

1133
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:37,150

1137
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,710
together and we're ready to do a lot of

1138
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,359
work this year it's a lot of work for

1139
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:48,910
the folks they're going to put in a lot

1140
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,400
of time and it's I'm very very happy

1141
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,680
with momentum we have these is a list of

1142

the both voting and non-voting members

1143
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,339
if actually you don't mind standing up

1144
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,710
in the audience so people can recognize

1145
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,650
them for their hard work as they're

1146
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:07,469
going to be in many many meetings

1147
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:07,469
[Applause]

1148
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:16,540
they've decided to slay the little extra

1149
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:18,939
for the next year so I'm excited as we

1150
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:22,360
get going we've convinced them to

1151
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:24,490
volunteer and they have and we get to

1152
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,590
take a lot of feedback and so that will

1153
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:28,479
give something a lot of time reading

1154
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:30,280
through all the community feedback we

1155
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,860
enjoy having a lot of feedback I'll

1156
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,200
remind the community many times that we

1157
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,720

1160

1181
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:45,260
understand what is it that you're

1182
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:47,000
thinking what is that you want this is a

1183
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,440
quick list it's on the webpage a little

1184
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,990
hard to read here fonts a little small

1185
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,220
but we have a proposed schedule we'll

1186
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:53,598
get that hardened out over the next

1187
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,910
couple of the weeks and get that make

1188
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,880
sure we have it firmed up a lot of work

1189
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,859
as we get into the next couple of months

1190
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,140
we'll get the questionnaires done we'll

1191
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:05,029
do the call for nominees and we'll

1192
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,710
prepare for interviews or the majority

1193
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:11,119
of interviews in Singapore so it'll be a

1194
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:13,849
big week for the NomCom just so folks

1195
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:17,210
understand the first year which was last

1196
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:20,510
year we we filled three a 1 a 2 and a 3

1197
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,460
year role for both the I IDF trust and

1198
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:25,910
the LLC and that was to be able to seed

1199
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:28,609
it so we can have a single nominee

1200
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:30,230
moving forward each successive year so

1201
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:32,150
this year we'll fill the one role as I

1202
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:34,910
mentioned earlier but last year we had

1203
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:38,540
done the three a one time basis to kind

1204
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:44,270
of seed it'll have an offsetting cast of

1205
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:46,970
board members so as a reminder feedback

1206
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:48,320
feedback is amazing I put it three times

1207
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,419
there you can see how important it is

1208
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,670

about I'm excited to hear everyone and I

1266
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:28,970
wanted to recommend in the interest of

1267
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,980
time and audibility I'd like to ask

1268
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:33,470
folks to save all clapping or cheering

1269
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,170
till the very end just so we can hear

1270
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:43,640
everything that everyone has to say

1271
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:46,220
thanks all right Leslie deagle um Jason

1272
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,750
you mentioned in your remarks that among

1273
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,330
the things that the very very busy new

1274
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:53,650
LLC board is doing is looking at

1275
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:56,240
planning how to simplify the contracts I

1276
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:57,980
kind of like to hear that expressed in

1277
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,529
terms of what is a strategic level

1278
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:02,960
objective that the LLC board has and how

1279
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:06,470
is your new executive director going to

1280
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,350
implement it so like why are we

1281
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,850
simplifying or why is the LLC board

1282
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,049
worried about what the contracts look

1283
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,670
like it seems to me that that's

1284
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,140
dangerously close to getting into the

1285
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,550
kind of nitpicking stuff as opposed to

1286
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,370
the high level strategic stuff that the

1287
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:20,780
LLC board was designed to do but I may

1288
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:23,390
have missed the point and I'd like to

1289
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,070
hear how you have a strategic objective

1290
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:28,520
that you're going to get the new

1291
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:30,350
executive director to implement you know

1292
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:33,000
from a contract standpoint it's it's

1293
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:35,130
sort of you know the more complex

1294
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,260
hated that you make a contract the

1295
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,450
harder it is to understand the harder it

1296
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,000
is to make sure that everyone agrees and

1297
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:44,370
is aligned on what the responsibilities

1298
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,680
are and so on so I think that's the idea

1299
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:48,630
and breaking them apart is making them a

1300
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,240
little bit simpler more comprehensible

1301
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,430
okay so you're telling me if I'm hearing

1302
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,100
correctly is that the LLC board would

1303
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:58,290
like to ensure that there is easing

1304
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,850
parity for all the understand the

1305
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,980
contracts and this is a high level

1306
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:05,130
priority in the establishment of this

1307
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:07,800
organization it's a high level objective

1308
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:10,110
it's part of the normal you know legal

1309
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,870
aspect and of the administration of this

1310
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:23,370
stuff yeah right well I'll probably see

1311
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:26,850
you in the next hour Mike thanks compete

1312
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:29,069
most sorry yeah so as people may have

1313
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:32,520
seen on the IETF list I've put out a

1314
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:34,380
draft called draft fear we got to stop

1315
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:39,840
meeting like this now the purpose of

1316
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:43,980
that trap is really simply to engage the

1317
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:46,350
LLC to start and UD perhaps to start

1318
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,880
thinking about new modalities of how we

1319
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:50,700
should be meeting with an eye towards

1320
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,640
not only effectiveness but also how we

1321
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:56,879
preserve the environment cost and a

1322
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:59,129
litany of other things the purpose of

1323
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,020
the draft is not to specify answers in

1324
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,820
fact I don't even know if we have the

1325
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,790
right questions in the draft but rather

1326
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:09,000
to have somebody who can look at this

1327
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:13,110
adult in a long-term way as you put up a

1328
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,830
list of meeting dates we tend to get

1329
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:19,800
back up in terms of you know thinking

1330
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:21,420
three four or five years in advance so

1331
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,160
any change we might want to even

1332
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,320
consider even an experimental level can

1333
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,390
take a while so the purpose of me

1334
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,670
standing here is to say first of all can

1335
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:31,440
people at the community please

1336
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,270
perhaps provide some comment on that

1337
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,040
draft and then perhaps could you take

1338
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:37,590
that forward as you see fit in

1339
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:40,740
consulting and consultations with the

1340
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:43,640
IES gee thanks I'll say certainly we

1341
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,080
definitely noticed the draft

1342
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,819
I thought it was interesting to read and

1343
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,100
we're watching all the community

1344
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:51,200
discussion so you know as community

1345
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,930
consensus develops you know that will

1346
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,240
help provide direction timing-wise to

1347
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:57,859
the extent that we wanted to follow some

1348
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,169
of your recommendations for example

1349
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:02,180
around a consultant to help do some

1350
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:04,280
assessment or something given that we're

1351
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:06,020
beginning the budget process soon you

1352
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,640
know the time may be convenient between

1353
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,290
now and the end of years something like

1354
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,029
that wanted to be budgeted but well

1355
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:13,880
certainly keep an eye on what the

1356
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:18,280
community discussion is and assess you

1357
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:22,850
know how to move forward and one thing

1358
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:26,240
you know we have a meeting location

1359
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:28,700
policy which calls for a specific

1360
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,410
rotation on specific time skill so there

1361
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,240
is some intersection between your

1362
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,790
proposal and that and that would be

1363
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,680
since the policy documented in what is

1364
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:38,660
now going to be a consensus RFC that

1365
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:44,779
would be a matter for community

1366
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:46,700
consensus to be determined the point is

1367
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,890
actually just to figure out where we

1368
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:51,259
might want to go the the draft basically

1369
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:52,970
calls for the for the LLC and the ISU to

1370
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,740
maybe bring some ideas back to the

1371
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:56,450
community and then to take it forward

1372
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,160
from there so sort of step by step and

1373
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:02,299
if we need to make changes in documents

1374
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:05,720
later we do that later okay Bob hi I'm

1375
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:08,390
Bob Dean didn't so nice report earlier

1376
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:10,790
I'm glad we're on budget so I was

1377
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:12,740
looking at the budget and particular I

1378
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:15,290
was comparing it against the previous

1379
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:17,540
year's budget and so what I noticed is

1380
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:20,000
that the previous year the total

1381
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:22,700
expenses were a little over seven

1382
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,170
million dollars seven million twenty

1383
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:28,580
nine five five five nine nine but the

1384
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:31,370
expenses for this year you know

1385
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:34,310
basically the first LLC budget whereas

1386
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:37,700
almost eight point seven million dollars

1387
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:42,380
so pretty much one point six million

1388
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:44,870
dollars more to have the LLC and it

1389
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:47,750
seems like quite a lot to me so I was I

1390
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:49,880
to questions relating to this I'd like

1391
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:52,460
you to tell us why it's going up so much

1392
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,020
and I'd also like to know why you didn't

1393
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,480
talk about this ever

1394
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,500
earlier because it's a you know pretty

1395
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,290
significant change

1396
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:04,310
that's the difference is close to the

1397
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:07,700
cost of you know I mean a meaning and a

1398
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:10,250
half of ITF meetings it's you know yeah

1399
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,259
this is a lot of money sure sure so the

1400
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:14,180
I'm going to defer to our treasurer in a

1401
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:16,970
second I would say that the budget was

1402
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:19,460
developed by the interim board you know

1403
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:22,490
so it was established you know late last

1404
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:24,470
year and I think has been discussed you

1405
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:27,620
know since that time but Shawn you want

1406
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:28,910
to speak to I think some of the cost

1407
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,140
differences come down with trying to

1408
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,879
figure out who was doing what to whom

1409
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:33,980
with respect to I saw him paying for

1410
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,930
things and it's basically trying to just

1411
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:39,230
lay out what the real costs were and

1412
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:40,250
that's that started before and we're

1413
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:44,690
going to continue to do that going

1414
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:47,210
forward that's a pretty general answer I

1415
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:49,340
would like to sort of get a lot more

1416
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,680
specifics from that to understand what's

1417
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:56,060
I mean this is a significant increase in

1418
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:58,609
the overhead costs of the ITF so I think

1419
01:05:56,060 --> 01:06:01,880
you know I'm not expecting you to do it

1420
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:04,610
the second but I think some more more

1421
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,130
responses of why why these extra

1422
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:09,530
expenses are incurred and what we're

1423
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,520
getting for it and you know why it's

1424
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:14,570
just a fact

1425
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:16,250
thank you I'll take a note thanks so we

1426
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,110
can follow up in more detail but just a

1427
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:21,800
few things I think as you know Bob the

1428
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:23,720
ITF budget has increased every year as

1429
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,670
long as I can remember not by this much

1430
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,649
but it's not as if the entire increase

1431
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:29,390
is attributable solely to the transition

1432
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,500
to the LLC because it increases every

1433
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:35,600
year we did talk about this when we were

1434
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:37,670
forming the LLC and you know in the

1435
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,839
working group process and in the interim

1436
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:41,630
board I think I'm the only person here

1437
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:44,090
who was on the interim board so so there

1438
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:46,250
was a bunch of discussion about this at

1439
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:49,880
the time when we created the budget a

1440
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:52,340
year ago and then and obviously a bunch

1441
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:54,380
of it is accountable to salaries that we

1442
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,730
that we budgeted for this year but

1443
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,020
aren't actually paying out because we

1444
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,570
haven't hired the people we didn't know

1445
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:01,009
the timing of the hiring but we had to

1446
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:03,260
budget as if it was a whole years worth

1447
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:05,630
of expenditure even though the people

1448
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,550
haven't been hired and then lastly just

1449
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:09,740
to note our revenue also increased

1450
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:11,460
significantly because we got a much

1451
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:13,770
larger contribution from I saw

1452
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:16,980
this year than we have in any prior year

1453
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:19,680
so it's not as if or a you know in

1454
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:22,560
danger of being underwater as a result

1455
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,020
of this but good questions we'll take it

1456
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,009
as an action item and follow back up

1457
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:29,430
there's more questions we've got a

1458
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:31,800
couple minutes left Mike Bishop I wanted

1459
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:36,120
to follow up on your comment that the

1460
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:38,490
endowment needs to grow further the

1461
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,140
endowment webpage has not been accepting

1462
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:43,350
donations since around the end of last

1463
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,759
year and now the endowment webpage as of

1464
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:46,410
sometime very recently gives you a

1465
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,890
certain error and then a 404 if you

1466
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:51,450
proceed past that yep I kind of think if

1467
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:54,690
we want more money we might want to

1468
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:57,120
start accepting it yeah no that's an

1469
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:59,640
excellent point we made a decision to

1470
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,359
and during the transition period for a

1471
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,520
short period of time

1472
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,680
take that down because it would be

1473
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:07,259
unclear what bank account

1474
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,060
it could be accepted into and it was

1475
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,980
difficult from an accounting and sort of

1476
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:14,130
paperwork standpoint to have a definite

1477
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:16,680
cut date for moving it over I think we

1478
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:18,000
also felt that we wanted to have a

1479
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,250
chance and there'll be community

1480
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,200
consultation of course with this sort of

1481
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:26,130
articulate what the long-term goals are

1482
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:28,019
and to you know explain this and put up

1483
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,550
a new page and so on so you know that's

1484
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,580
going to go out eventually to community

1485
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:34,200
comment and you know we're in an interim

1486
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,670
period but I agree I you can't accept

1487
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,830
more money if you don't have a page to

1488
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:40,620
accept it I think though at the same

1489
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:42,569
time a lot of the the places that we're

1490
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:45,479
going to go aren't places that might

1491
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:46,979
donate on a webpage so you know it

1492
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:48,269
depends what our target audience is and

1493
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:52,469
that's part of that assessment that will

1494
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:55,230
do do you have a timeline for that it

1495
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:57,930
certainly you know hiring and smarf peas

1496
01:08:55,229 --> 01:09:00,919
are probably in the queue beforehand

1497
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:04,920
it's next few months I think is our goal

1498
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:11,970
and last comments and then we have to

1499
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:15,240
close up how do I love this term and in

1500
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:18,090
what way are two contracts that they

1501
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:21,059
find to functions and the interface

1502
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:23,700
between them simpler than one contracts

1503
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:31,040
that defines two functions

1504
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:34,109
I mean I was a bit confused by this

1505
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:36,390
striving towards making more contracts

1506
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:38,399
because my experience is that more

1507
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:40,050
contracts creates more interfaces which

1508
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,319
creates more confusion which creates

1509
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:46,350
more trouble and the last thing you want

1510
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:49,740
a trouble and it's micromanagement by

1511
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:51,300
the border Kate comment yeah I know I

1512
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,920
don't think it's micromanagement at all

1513
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,870
I think it's just doing our job to

1514
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,690
reduce risk and make things more clear

1515
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:01,980
and simple and in particular I think

1516
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:03,660
that it might be one perspective to say

1517
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,849
that you know two contracts is more

1518
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,260
complicated than one but at the same

1519
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:09,390
time when you come in and you look at an

1520
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,430
agreement and you try to figure out well

1521
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:14,580
this service is this particular thing

1522
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:17,310
which of these pages does apply to that

1523
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:19,650
it's very complicated when over time you

1524
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:22,170
keep adding to an existing contract and

1525
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,599
at some point the underlying contract

1526
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:27,060
isn't fit for the purpose of some of the

1527
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,490
add-on services and so we're trying to

1528
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:32,310
bring clarity here it's not about

1529
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:35,130
micromanagement and you know we're

1530
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:38,370
trying to again make it more clear and

1531
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:44,340
easy to understand over the long term so

1532
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:46,950
I would be very happy to see you make

1533
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,840
hire someone who knows how to run

1534
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:52,190
contracts and in differences between

1535
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:56,130
them and give them that power to decide

1536
01:10:52,190 --> 01:11:00,480
so yes do figure out what the functions

1537
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:02,600
are but when it comes to the legal stuff

1538
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,889
leave it through professionals please

1539
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:07,080
yeah I hear ya we do have to only have a

1540
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,870
legal counsel and that's a core part of

1541
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,880
our agreement thank you alright thanks

1542
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:13,620
very much for your time yeah I think

1543
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,120
we're we're closed in terms of time

1544
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,120

following up your something in your

report unless I you I want to say thanks

1565
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:21,420
to the is GG for recognizing the issue

1566
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:23,790
with regards to tone on mailing lists

1567
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:25,440
and so on and so forth and and also

1568
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:27,510
taking on some responsibility for

1569
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:32,059
addressing that but I think I'd also

1570
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:34,230
like to say we are you and you are us

1571
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:37,880
it was interesting to hear that you've

1572
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:41,339
had some input from professional

1573
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,810
communications management people I'd be

1574
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,940
curious to know what it was that they

1575
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:48,540
shared with you and you know could you

1576
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:51,000
share it with us and in a large part

1577
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,800
because while I recognize this is the is

1578
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,060
G this is the current is G in March

1579
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,060
there will be a slightly different eyes

1580
01:13:54,060 --> 01:14:00,360
she so it's sort of like educating all

1581
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:03,420
of us educates not only this is G but

1582
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:06,059
all future ones to thanks totally yeah

1583
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:08,190
we were super lucky that this man my coy

1584
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:10,830
was able to drive over from his house

1585
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:13,650
and meet with a few of us but definitely

1586
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:15,809
plan to distill everything that we have

1587
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:19,710
learned and we'll continue to learn so

1588
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:23,550
everyone can benefit from it Martin yeah

1589
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:26,520
mana Thompson um to further those point

1590
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:28,860
I think that I personally like to make a

1591
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,250
commitment here and I encourage others

1592
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:34,259
to do the same I've felt constrained for

1593
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:37,770
in the recent discussions I didn't feel

1594
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:41,100
like I could say anything and I realized

1595
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:43,550
recently partly in the conversation with

1596
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:46,260
Mike that we had earlier this week that

1597
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:51,450
standing by and letting this bad

1598
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:56,160
behavior occur is me being part of the

1599
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:59,280
problem so in addition to me being

1600
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:01,290
respectful of others and the diversity

1601
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:04,530
of opinions that we have here and the

1602
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:05,160
great set of people that form this

1603
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:11,040
community

1604
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:14,220
I plan to be less tolerant of bad

1605
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,790
behavior in others and I'd encourage

1606
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:18,810
others to do so

1607
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,810
[Music]

1608
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:30,600
Thank You Martin dan dan were bandaged

1609
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:34,200
about the some feedback from Austrian

1610
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:37,890
NomCom member recruiting candidates for

1611
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:40,139
80 positions is really hard as you

1612
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:42,300
probably know but I really want the

1613
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:45,180
whole community to hear that because

1614
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,900
lately it was a very interesting comment

1615
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,120
that I heard

1616
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:49,799
try to get some people to nominate for a

1617
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,840
B and asking them if they would be

1618
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,900
interested oh it's a career death

1619
01:15:51,840 --> 01:16:01,260
sentence I still want to do development

1620
01:15:54,900 --> 01:16:03,900
work and we have to think about that how

1621
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:05,460
we can solve that the other part also

1622
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:07,920
what the IDS are saying well there's one

1623
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:10,380
thing that this is in the job

1624
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,590
description and the other part what is

1625
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:17,120
the actual work that we have to do there

1626
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:21,510
is a very specific way how to lead a

1627
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:23,849
volunteer organization and we have to

1628
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:28,230
think about that learn how to do that

1629
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:31,890
and then based on that grow and groom

1630
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:33,570
you know the potential leaders but it is

1631
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,830
I don't think this is enough to be

1632
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:38,750
discussed within the NomCom

1633
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:42,269
or within the ISD this has to be a wider

1634
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:44,850
problem of the whole community because

1635
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:48,210
at one point the people who are rotating

1636
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:56,940
through their leadership positions will

1637
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:58,199
retire and then what I think I mean I

1638
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:00,419
think we agree with you I think

1639
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:03,389
hopefully no one up here feels like it's

1640
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:04,949
a death sentence but to the extent that

1641
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:07,790
people feel that way that's it that's a

1642
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:11,219
major issue it's it it's been an ongoing

1643
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:12,390
discussion in the IHG and and we would

1644
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:14,760
welcome the discussion with the

1645
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:15,960
community about it as well okay I'm

1646
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,280
gonna cut the mic line because we're

1647
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,449
supposed to stick to ten minutes and

1648
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:22,409
Kirsty you're next

1649
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:24,480
Thank You Christy PN CSC so I just

1650
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:26,429
wanted to echo some of the comments that

1651
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,809
been said about conduct it's been really

1652
01:17:26,429 --> 01:17:30,960
good to see that being taken seriously

1653
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:33,449
and at this ITF I'm leading this as well

1654
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,480
I had a suggestion you just mentioned

1655
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:39,030
before and ways to prevent or you know

1656
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:42,269
tackle bad behavior and your idea here

1657
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:45,269
so I just wanted to pitch my idea which

1658
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:49,650
was to create an everyday sexism style

1659
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:51,239
and that everyday IETF so for those who

1660
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:53,129
aren't aware of the everyday sexism

1661
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:55,409
project I recommend looking up on

1662
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:56,850
Twitter it's just where people can

1663
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:58,639
submit their experiences where they

1664
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:01,970
relate to sexism and harassment

1665
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:04,910
that experience so I'm proposing just as

1666
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:06,620
an idea and everyday ITF not limited to

1667
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:09,820
the sexism and harassment you might

1668
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:12,410
experience but poor conduct and various

1669
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:15,500
difficult behaviors you might encounter

1670
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:17,059
and so I just put that forward as an

1671
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:23,020
idea following the everyday sexism

1672
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:23,020
format thank you thank you very much

1673
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:30,290
Daniel can go more so I am very happy to

1674
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:33,580
hear that this community is starting to

1675
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:36,830
take our internal conduct more seriously

1676
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:38,630
we do a lot of work in the public and we

1677
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:41,740
are an extremely unrepresentative sample

1678
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:44,480
of the people who depend on our work and

1679
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:47,570
there are a lot of people who might be

1680
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,730
interested in being here who are turned

1681
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:51,880
off by all kinds of stuff that happens

1682
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:54,980
here probably just the technical jargon

1683
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,750
but the the aggressiveness that we

1684
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,299
sometimes treat each other even when we

1685
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:01,220
know each other well is really

1686
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:04,730
off-putting especially to some newcomers

1687
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:06,680
so I think we would do well to take that

1688
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:09,679
seriously and think about the way that

1689
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:11,810
the conduct not only has an effect on

1690
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,160
those of us who are here and I'm sure

1691
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:14,840
we've all been burned by some of this

1692
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,519
conduct but I hope that we're thinking

1693
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,440
about the conduct in respect to the

1694
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:23,290
people who aren't here and whether we

1695
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:27,889
want more people to join us thank you

1696
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:29,420
July anger Martin and EKG you have

1697
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,620
basically said everything you want to

1698
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:35,150
say but I'm gonna say it again

1699
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:37,730
because it's worth repeating I've been

1700
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:40,009
with this community for 19 years and I

1701
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:42,169
don't really pay attention or listen to

1702
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:44,810
the ietf mailing list I'm not saying

1703
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:46,910
this because I'm proud of it

1704
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:48,920
I'm saying this because I can't keep up

1705
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:57,080
with the what I see on the mailing list

1706
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:59,210
often times separately I run applaud but

1707
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,250
I won't I I do want to say that this is

1708
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:03,800
what I saw on the slides was very

1709
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:06,080
encouraging this is to me the leadership

1710
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:08,330
taking some some action on sort of

1711
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,920
figuring out how to deal with conduct

1712
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:12,699
but what I saw on the slides was more so

1713
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,040
more of a safeguard against

1714
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:17,980
behavior actually making this place

1715
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:20,769
positive and encouraging for others to

1716
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:23,410
contribute in is something that the

1717
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:27,130
community each one of us has to do and

1718
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:29,769
to that extent the minimum that I can do

1719
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:32,890
is to make sure that if I see somebody

1720
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:35,199
being abrasive or continuously abrasive

1721
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:39,480
I will call it out I'll at least talk to

1722
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:46,500
them I try to make sure that it's

1723
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:49,928
considered thank you Mark Nottingham I

1724
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:51,400
have a suggestion I don't know if it's a

1725
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:54,489
good one but I think it's worth thinking

1726
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:57,280
about and John referred earlier to the

1727
01:20:54,489 --> 01:21:00,759
IETF main list it's a free-for-all

1728
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,889
I appreciate the focus on behavior that

1729
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:05,110
we're seeing this is really good but I

1730
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:06,690
can't help but wonder if it's really

1731
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,860
represented the community more

1732
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,419
anecdotally I hear of a lot of people

1733
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,239
who don't subscribe to it because they

1734
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:15,910
find it too gladiatorial toxic whatever

1735
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:17,500
word you want to use and as a result I

1736
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:20,469
wonder if we're getting good technical

1737
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:22,449
input there especially regarding IETF

1738
01:21:20,469 --> 01:21:24,190
last calls that's one of the purposes of

1739
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:26,919
the list it's supposed to be the

1740
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:29,620
community's review of the technical work

1741
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,699
that's happening here so to me it seems

1742
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:33,760
like we should have a list that's

1743
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:36,009
dedicated to that purpose and much more

1744
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,440
heavily moderated than the IETF main

1745
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:40,540
list so that the participants who can't

1746
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:43,330
put up with that level of whatever it is

1747
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:45,370
can still go and have a voice in last

1748
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:46,900
call of discussions I know there are

1749
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:47,980
some downsides to that but I think it's

1750
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:58,030
something we should take seriously

1751
01:21:47,980 --> 01:22:00,370
consider I'll take the applause and lack

1752
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:03,340
of boos to support for what Mark said I

1753
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:05,410
support it also I think the discussions

1754
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:07,390
that happen on the IETF list are

1755
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:10,000
important discussions and while they may

1756
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:11,860
veer off into the weeds in particular

1757
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,010
discussions might be annoying on the

1758
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:17,530
whole we need it but I agree completely

1759
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:19,780
that we should make the I the the last

1760
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:22,509
call comments and the threads that come

1761
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:24,580
out of that have their own home so I

1762
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:26,139
would like to support that I'd like the

1763
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:28,809
iesg to do that

1764
01:22:26,139 --> 01:22:31,659
yeah seek some more feedback on that

1765
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:33,070
suggestion thank you and that brings us

1766
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:42,940
to the end of our 10 minutes so thank

1767
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:45,130
you is she and next we have the IV so

1768
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,599
the IV could go ahead and come up so

1769
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:48,699
that we don't have another shift after

1770
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,960
Olaf speaks that would be good

1771
01:22:48,699 --> 01:22:51,960
thank you very much

1772
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,350
Cindy can I ask you a favor there's a

1773
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:13,300
monitor behind me that is producing some

1774
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:14,830
noise that's causing my hearing aids to

1775
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:16,150
go crazy if you can see if they can turn

1776
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:17,230
that down or off that would be very

1777
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:18,940
useful

1778
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:25,750

01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:11,169
through a short review of the 66 35

1790
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:13,960
structures and process hello um so yeah

1791
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:16,989
my name is Olaf colic mom I work for the

1792
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:19,980
Internet Society but I don't speak on

1793
01:24:16,989 --> 01:24:23,799
their behalf I'm specifically not now

1794
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:27,489
I'm here as the forming a former acting

1795
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:30,940
RFC series editor and also as a

1796
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:34,269
co-editor of the current model the RC a

1797
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:36,570
data model version 2 there's something

1798
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:37,800
to unpack in here

1799
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:40,860
the

1800
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:43,650
that there is an acting RFC series

1801
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:46,170
editor or there has been an acting our C

1802
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:51,119
series editor and that the RSC editor

1803
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:55,650
model is on version 2 means that this is

1804
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:59,790
part of a longer conversation here's a

1805
01:24:55,650 --> 01:25:02,129
first disclaimer I am NOT going to tell

1806
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:05,159
you the whole history and I'm not going

1807
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:09,210
to perform exegesis on all these error

1808
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:12,480
sees the intent is to give you an idea

1809
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:13,800
of specifically the people who are new

1810
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,138
in this room and new to this

1811
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:19,469
conversation what we are talking about

1812
01:25:16,139 --> 01:25:25,500
when we have the discussion at mic lines

1813
01:25:19,469 --> 01:25:27,570
in a few minutes from now so part of a

1814
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,579
longer conversation a conversation that

1815
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:33,110
started 50 years ago and it has gone

1816
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:35,940
through several iterations in trying to

1817
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:38,699
institutionalize it in a way that is

1818
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:41,000
suitable for the community the broader

1819
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:41,000
community

1820
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:52,590
this model documented in RFC 66 35 has

1821
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:59,070
now been in operation for about seven

1822
01:25:52,590 --> 01:26:02,880
years I believe the first ideas around

1823
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:05,369
this model are documented in RFC 4844

1824
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:08,730
and it basically describes what it is

1825
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:11,429
that an RFC editor is expected to do so

1826
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:16,110
what I'm telling you today is a bit of a

1827
01:26:11,429 --> 01:26:21,540
combination between RFC 84 44 and RFC 66

1828
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:24,839
35 so when we talk about the RFC editor

1829
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:27,570
we we talk about a function a function

1830
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:31,349
that used to be performed by one person

1831
01:26:27,570 --> 01:26:33,840
but that has evolved and what the RC

1832
01:26:31,349 --> 01:26:36,510
editor essentially does it takes raw

1833
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:40,320
input text in the form of internet rocks

1834
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:43,980
and it spits out RFC's that is the most

1835
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:47,099
simplistic way of thinking about the RFC

1836
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:49,348
earth but of course there is structure

1837
01:26:47,099 --> 01:26:51,360
to this

1838
01:26:49,349 --> 01:26:54,840
where does the income the input come

1839
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:58,799
from the input comes from you in the

1840
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:05,599
form of ITF documents as approved by the

1841
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:09,030
IHT RTF documents as approved by the RRS

1842
01:27:05,599 --> 01:27:12,210
IRS G the IAB documents as approved by

1843
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:13,619
the IAB and the independent documents as

1844
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:18,630
approved by the in the method

1845
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:20,759
independent submission after the

1846
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:23,070
independent submission editor is a part

1847
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,199
of the RC model that we are discussing

1848
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:28,170
but I'm going to shift that apart this

1849
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:33,869
is all input this is not part of the

1850
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:36,780
errors yet the RC editor simply or

1851
01:27:33,869 --> 01:27:40,619
simply this sort of design tested like

1852
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:44,159
this and I realize I'm talking about

1853
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:47,839
boxes and about and and and these boxes

1854
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:51,960
of course there are people behind this

1855
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,790
so apologies by putting it here like

1856
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:57,989
this

1857
01:27:52,790 --> 01:28:00,719
first your internet drafts get into the

1858
01:27:57,989 --> 01:28:05,070
system and there are copy edited by the

1859
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:09,150
RFC production center the RC production

1860
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:11,670
center producing RC and gives that RFC

1861
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:16,259
to another entity which is the RFC

1862
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:19,440
publisher and they publish the RFC and

1863
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:21,780
archive it those two functions are

1864
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:24,809
currently operated by one contractor

1865
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:27,179
which is AMS and you all know sandy and

1866
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:29,699
Alice they are the people who for

1867
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:34,079
instance work in the RC production

1868
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:38,089
center then there is the RC series

1869
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:42,179
editor the RC series editor is the

1870
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:44,719
person that is has a number of functions

1871
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:48,300
with respect to the sort of long-term

1872
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:52,290
strategy and and the management of the

1873
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:54,150
entity the responsibilities of the RC

1874
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:55,769
series editor are strategic leadership

1875
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:58,500
and management of the publication and

1876
01:28:55,770 --> 01:29:01,260
production functions so that is

1877
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,820
managerial oversight but also strategic

1878
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:07,739
leadership thinking about

1879
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:10,380
how dysfunctions evolve representation

1880
01:29:07,739 --> 01:29:12,329
of the RC series towards the ITF and

1881
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,840
others including the development of our

1882
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:17,219
simulated policy in the wider context

1883
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:19,650
this is what have there has been doing

1884
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:23,070
in the report that you just saw was an

1885
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:25,469
aspect of that development of RC

1886
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:28,650
production and publication so how do we

1887
01:29:25,469 --> 01:29:29,219
evolve how we produce our FCS and how

1888
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:32,098
we'll do it

1889
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:34,320
publish them the errata for instance is

1890
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:37,050
an example of that and the development

1891
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:40,290
of the RC series itself discussions

1892
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:45,000
about streams about new new types of

1893
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:47,909
content community many of these

1894
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:51,170
functions are ultimately overseeing on

1895
01:29:47,909 --> 01:29:54,598
behalf of the wider community by the IAB

1896
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:58,380
the Ivey has a chartered responsibility

1897
01:29:54,599 --> 01:30:00,300
in oversight of the RC series and the

1898
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:04,710
way that of this implemented is that the

1899
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:07,710
RFC has created a DV the the IAB has

1900
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:12,030
delegated a lot of the responsibility to

1901
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:14,659
the RC series Oversight Committee this

1902
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:17,989
is sort of how the oversight and

1903
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:20,879
responsibilities are working so at a

1904
01:30:17,989 --> 01:30:23,280
bottom you have the two should have

1905
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,440
published the production the publication

1906
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:30,750
function the contracts maintained the

1907
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:34,530
contractor is AMS and contracts in this

1908
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:37,290
diagram are all with the LLC that was of

1909
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:39,059
course the IOC wounds RC was written so

1910
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:40,860
that's the orange lines or the lines

1911
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:45,090
that come from the right I'm not quite

1912
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:45,690
sure if orange and green is seen by

1913
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:48,360
everybody

1914
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:50,848
I just those are the lines coming down

1915
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:54,199
from the right those are contractual

1916
01:30:50,849 --> 01:31:01,170
relationships those are budget oversight

1917
01:30:54,199 --> 01:31:03,928
matters RFC 48:44 speaks about

1918
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:08,040
administration on oversight by the IFC

1919
01:31:03,929 --> 01:31:11,849
and policy oversight by the IDE and so

1920
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:14,849
the strategy and substance is our seen

1921
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:16,320
by the IAB but that is all in

1922
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:18,330
conversation of course

1923
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:20,820
the developed in conversation with the

1924
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:23,610
community at large and there's a book in

1925
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:25,889
this slide the community-at-large arrows

1926
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:26,400
go one way of course they should go two

1927
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:29,370
ways

1928
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:33,049
there is interaction that is supposed to

1929
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:33,050
be a conversation

1930
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:42,720
the are sock is a program or Committee

1931
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:47,129
of the IAD the idea at the time was that

1932
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:49,770
the IB is a rotating body and in order

1933
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:52,200
to give longer-term and strategic

1934
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:55,110
guidance it is important to get people

1935
01:31:52,200 --> 01:32:00,150
in there that have a lifespan that is

1936
01:31:55,110 --> 01:32:02,070
longer than than the IAB itself and one

1937
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:11,160
has the ability to put people with

1938
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:14,280
specialized background i'm surprised not

1939
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:16,260
to see the RFC series advisory group or

1940
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,120
the independent editorial board that was

1941
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:21,780
in my speaking notes and i was about to

1942
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:25,230
say the astute observer would say there

1943
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:28,410
is no RC series advisory group that's

1944
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:30,750
simply because the the model doesn't

1945
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:34,260
prescribe that group it is an advisory

1946
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:37,530
group that is acting on behalf of the

1947
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:40,830
RFC series editor the s of what is the

1948
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:44,670
right wording here so if you hear about

1949
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:47,700
the r seck RC series advisory group that

1950
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:51,570
would be a box that is hanging off the

1951
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:55,290
RC series editor but really informs that

1952
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:57,840
function that is the oversight that I

1953
01:32:55,290 --> 01:33:00,030
want to give I hope that informs the

1954
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:03,060
discussion for the people who have never

1955
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:06,150
heard of these these functions I'm not

1956
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:11,280
going to take terrifying questions I'm

1957
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:14,210
going to get phone safe thank you very

1958
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:20,490
much Olaf for putting together this

1959
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:22,710
slide deck and giving this background as

1960
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:25,889
I said in my email earlier the IB is

1961
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:27,900
primarily here to listen so please if

1962
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:30,040
you have advice for us at this point

1963
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:35,500
please get the mic ones

1964
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:37,510
Lucy Lucy Lynch so I thank all Olaf for

1965
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:40,420
this there are some places in the model

1966
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:42,910
and that I might argue with him a bit I

1967
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,790
actually think the RFC editor is a role

1968
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:50,710
not just a function I actually think the

1969
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:54,790
series in itself is a box along with the

1970
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:57,840
IAB and the iesg I think it creates the

1971
01:33:54,790 --> 01:34:02,080
idea so for me

1972
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:06,760
stewardship of the aisle the RFC series

1973
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:09,640
and protection of the independence and

1974
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:12,490
the integrity of the RFC editor as a

1975
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:15,210
role are extremely important so I have a

1976
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:18,580
couple of questions for you Ted

1977
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:21,490
speaking for the IAB what do you think

1978
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:24,640
the role of the series's what do you

1979
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:28,179
think the role of the RFC editor is and

1980
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:32,110
what is the responsibility of the IAB as

1981
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:34,930
stewards of that asset so I think one of

1982
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:38,290
the things that changed in the RFC

1983
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:40,080
editor model version two is that some of

1984
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:43,210
the things which had historically been

1985
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:45,760
associated with the single role were

1986
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:47,830
moved into multiple roles and one of the

1987
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,900
productive functions of the RSC editor

1988
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:52,720
has historically been to provide a

1989
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:55,120
mechanism to allow people who are not

1990
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:57,670
part of the ITF standards process or one

1991
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:59,410
of the other kind of common ways of

1992
01:34:57,670 --> 01:35:02,260
producing documents of interest in a

1993
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:05,500
Jeanette technical community to to

1994
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:09,880
publish and I think we took that aspect

1995
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:12,190
of the RFC editor historic function and

1996
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:14,440
it became the independent series editor

1997
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:16,780
which has its own editorial board and

1998
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:18,879
became one of the input streams so I

1999
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:21,190
think to some degree I certainly agree

2000
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:24,720
with you the RFC editor is itself a role

2001
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:27,940
but it's also a role that has been

2002
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:30,370
shared among multiple other roles in

2003
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:32,379
this current model now you asked me what

2004
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:35,650
I thought the role of the RSC editors

2005
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:38,170
and they the way I look at it from a

2006
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:40,150
metaphor perspective is sort of like a

2007
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:41,980
town planner if you think about what we

2008
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:44,460
do we're the construction workers we

2009
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:48,900
build the houses

2010
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:51,390
what the RFC production center does is

2011
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:53,219
they come through and make sure that

2012
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:55,770
everything in the houses is up to code

2013
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:59,550
and if necessary they help us bring it

2014
01:35:55,770 --> 01:36:02,940
up to code if it isn't the world the RSC

2015
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:05,280
plays is more like a town planner she

2016
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:07,889
doesn't get into the details of whether

2017
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:09,509
any particular document is up to code

2018
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:11,580
she helps make sure that the codes are

2019
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:14,910
modern and she helps make sure that the

2020
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:16,860
outputs from the city are well under

2021
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:19,440
well connected to the rest of the world

2022
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:22,620
that the roads coming in and out of the

2023
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:25,889
city in this case the publication venues

2024
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:28,410
in which the RFC editor sorry the RFC

2025
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:32,220
publications are understood that all of

2026
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:36,150
those work well so from our perspective

2027
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:38,580
it's a very very important role and it's

2028
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:42,210
at a level that most of us don't operate

2029
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:44,220
on a day-to-day basis we're mostly the

2030
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:47,450
construction workers for writing a draft

2031
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:49,530
or mostly building the houses and

2032
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:54,510
interacting on a day to day basis for

2033
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:57,809
the code inspectors so as stewards of

2034
01:36:54,510 --> 01:37:00,300
that function and you know as Brian

2035
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:01,740
carpenters put this the kind of

2036
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,860
stewardship that's involved in that has

2037
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:08,219
gone through multiple steps the main

2038
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:10,799
thing too that we have to do as stores

2039
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:13,470
is to make sure it keeps going we're not

2040
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,170
experts in town planning we're not

2041
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:19,050
experts in publication our job is to

2042
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:20,850
make sure that with the community and

2043
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:23,520
with the our sock that the function

2044
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:27,450
keeps going so that the individually

2045
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:30,390
built houses each draft remains part of

2046
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:34,220
a functioning whole the city or the

2047
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:34,220
series does that make sense

2048
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:43,949
it does make sense it also explains to

2049
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:49,570
me a little bit why you may have a more

2050
01:37:43,949 --> 01:37:52,860
limited view of the editorial capability

2051
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:55,119
that provides that integrity

2052
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:56,920
independence whatever that is needed

2053
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:59,610
speaking for the big I internet

2054
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:03,099
community not just the inside the box

2055
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:05,559
okay and I appreciate that I will say

2056
01:38:03,099 --> 01:38:07,060
that it's never a good idea to let the

2057
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,679
people who are building the houses to

2058
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:10,570
write the code there's always a risk

2059
01:38:08,679 --> 01:38:13,900
there you do want independence and I

2060
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:16,929
recognize that so I think that the order

2061
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:18,969
was actually John was next and then up

2062
01:38:16,929 --> 01:38:20,980
to the front like the French on the

2063
01:38:18,969 --> 01:38:34,830
police way we ended up with the same

2064
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:41,169
question so John was excused my

2065
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:43,030
deteriorating voice Ted I want to start

2066
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:46,030
with a brief observation about all his

2067
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:46,540
presentation which is that when the are

2068
01:38:46,030 --> 01:38:49,269
socks

2069
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:55,739
started and I was very much part of it

2070
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:55,739
at the beginning it saw its role as

2071
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:04,119
assisting and aiding the RSC to perform

2072
01:39:00,699 --> 01:39:07,360
well and make and make sure the overall

2073
01:39:04,119 --> 01:39:09,610
function works and at some stage that

2074
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:12,250
seems to have shifted into what's now

2075
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:18,519
seeing it as a oversight in the

2076
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:20,170
management sense role and I don't know

2077
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:26,469
what started that shift or how we got

2078
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:28,929
there but I noticed that the the IAB has

2079
01:39:26,469 --> 01:39:32,050
over the last several years completely

2080
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:34,630
were populated our sock and I'd like to

2081
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:38,199
better understand why that was done and

2082
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:40,000
how the mandate and your expectations of

2083
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:42,909
the our sock in the RIC changed in the

2084
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:46,929
process thank you

2085
01:39:42,909 --> 01:39:49,030
so the curve seen 66 35 doesn't actually

2086
01:39:46,929 --> 01:39:51,730
tell the IAB

2087
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:54,490
on what schedule to repopulated or how

2088
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:56,830
to do it and so the IAB has done it on a

2089
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:59,099
periodic basis essentially in the past

2090
01:39:56,830 --> 01:40:02,650
four or five years every two years and

2091
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:05,110
looked for new volunteers or looked to

2092
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:07,330
refresh the program the last time

2093
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:10,480
through we did a standard program

2094
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:12,340
refresh which means that we called call

2095
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:14,620
for volunteers for the whole program got

2096
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:16,750
many volunteers who'd already been on

2097
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:19,210
the arishok for some time and some new

2098
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:24,730
ones and then asked for community

2099
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:27,820
commentary and then went through the the

2100
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:30,639
process of selecting some and populating

2101
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,230
the new our SOG as you notice that we've

2102
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,910
we've definitely heard from the

2103
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:36,099
community that that might have been the

2104
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:38,230
wrong thing to do and we've proposed to

2105
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:41,020
the community that we switch that if

2106
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:43,809
there are not more major changes to a

2107
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:46,180
rotating membership for three year fixed

2108
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:50,020
terms with renewal that make sure that

2109
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:53,530
we never refresh all of the are sock

2110
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:56,650
again at any one time and I think that

2111
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:59,019
that is sort of a structural change that

2112
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:01,360
will help make sure that the lessons we

2113
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:03,820
learn from this aren't as easy to lose

2114
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,269
because I do think you're right one of

2115
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:10,179
the things that happened here was the

2116
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:12,160
standard meaning of oversight more and

2117
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:16,360
more came into play in the understanding

2118
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:18,849
of what the the are sock was meant to be

2119
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,490
doing and I think in particular it

2120
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:23,770
occurs when you're around these moments

2121
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:27,280
of contract and contract renewal and

2122
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:28,840
it's because in those cases it causes

2123
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,780
people who have standard business

2124
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:33,790
arrangements to say hey I understand

2125
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:36,370
what oversight means when I'm making a

2126
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:40,720
contract or I understand what oversight

2127
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:44,110
means when I'm hiring a person that we

2128
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,970
lost some of the nuance that what

2129
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:48,160
oversight was meant to mean was

2130
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:51,580
something different here and I think

2131
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:54,070
that what we're looking to figure out I

2132
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:55,570
mean obviously this whole process has

2133
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:56,860
been a forceful reminder that the

2134
01:41:55,570 --> 01:42:00,030
community has a different expectation

2135
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:02,320
here how we make sure that this becomes

2136
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:02,920
reflected in the documents in a way that

2137
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:05,500
it's part of this

2138
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:09,040
structures because it's it's pretty

2139
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:11,350
obvious we had people with five three

2140
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:15,010
two years of experience on on the air

2141
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:17,679
sock but the Lord didn't get carried

2142
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:19,600
forward in the program enough I think it

2143
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:21,670
has to be in the documents in themselves

2144
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,260
and I think we've referred to that as

2145
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:25,960
kind of one of the structural things

2146
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:27,880
that happened here where the way the

2147
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:32,590
document was written and what it talked

2148
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:34,330
about as oversight had very basic hiring

2149
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:36,850
and firing kind of oversight in it and

2150
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:39,160
other things that describe the role in

2151
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:41,710
different ways and the tension between

2152
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:45,760
them has now been manifested in this

2153
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:47,949
tension and we need to fix them in in

2154
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,300
addition to that and I will make this

2155
01:42:47,949 --> 01:42:53,610
very brief ha there was a shift from

2156
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:57,010
expecting there to be serious

2157
01:42:53,610 --> 01:43:00,480
publication strategy expertise on the

2158
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:03,280
our sock that got lost somewhere in the

2159
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:05,769
process and that also may be a matter of

2160
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:08,259
not having written things down enough it

2161
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:11,080
may be a matter of not enough

2162
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:12,610
institutional memory on the IAB but to

2163
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:15,010
the extent to which one wants that

2164
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:17,440
historical quote oversight and quote

2165
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:20,830
rule that has to be expertise there

2166
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:22,178
which is above and beyond very sincere

2167
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:24,460
members of the community want to help

2168
01:43:22,179 --> 01:43:28,390
with this thanks for the feedback Thank

2169
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:30,790
You Kathleen I think you guys okay so my

2170
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:32,850
questions for Ted and Alyssa and I'm

2171
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:36,040
gonna ask this multi-part question

2172
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:38,530
retrospectively but it's more with an

2173
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:41,260
eye towards how do we make this into the

2174
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:43,630
process going forward and make sure that

2175
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:46,390
it's considered I think it will make a

2176
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:49,690
difference so was risk management

2177
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:51,880
considered in a decision process and by

2178
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:54,969
that I mean where the potential outcomes

2179
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:58,989
enumerated with the possible outcomes

2180
01:43:54,969 --> 01:44:01,140
and I'm sorry possible outcomes and

2181
01:43:58,989 --> 01:44:04,209
potential business impact and

2182
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:06,940
remediation options as to inform

2183
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:09,310
business decision and I asked us as I've

2184
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:11,190
been C so multiple times right so I've

2185
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:14,890
had to go through this type of process

2186
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:17,650
every time some some sort of large

2187
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:21,460
security decision was being made

2188
01:44:17,650 --> 01:44:23,830
and another part of that was the LLC

2189
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:26,680
consulted since they own the contract or

2190
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:28,780
the trust which Aman's

2191
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:31,239
I know we weren't but we own the

2192
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:33,130
published RFC's so so let me go

2193
01:44:31,239 --> 01:44:36,309
backwards and that the way the process

2194
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:39,040
is currently structured the LLC part of

2195
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:41,440
the process had not started when this

2196
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:44,019
information came into the LLC and the

2197
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:46,690
IAB that the RC was not renewing her

2198
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:49,210
contract and so I think not forward

2199
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:51,910
before the recommendation letter went

2200
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:55,260
out like okay so I think having risk

2201
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:58,210
management started at that early phase

2202
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:01,120
could have helped but I am asking that

2203
01:44:58,210 --> 01:45:06,330
to Ted and Alissa not to the are Sauk

2204
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:09,640
because I view this this is really a a

2205
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:11,559
level above that in terms of where we're

2206
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:15,219
we're replacing risk management

2207
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:17,500
functions and having the process that

2208
01:45:15,219 --> 01:45:19,960
goes up through the business to people

2209
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:25,300
who are responsible right to make those

2210
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:27,010
business decisions thank you for the

2211
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:28,780
comment I think I might need to follow

2212
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:31,060
up with you a little bit more offline

2213
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:32,800
about exactly how your modeling risk

2214
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:35,500
management because I think what you mean

2215
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:37,120
by it might not be quite what I

2216
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,410
understand it but given the mic lines if

2217
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:40,360
you don't mind I'd like to take the

2218
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:41,590
further detail that's fine I've done

2219
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:43,210
quite a bit of work in this space so

2220
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:45,400
it's really just making sure it goes up

2221
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:46,960
to people in the business it looks like

2222
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,620
Alissa wants to respond as well so I'd

2223
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,320
appreciate that

2224
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:52,710
okay thank you soon your next Thank You

2225
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:56,620
sorry

2226
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:59,350
I mean happy to have more follow-up on

2227
01:45:56,620 --> 01:46:01,989
this but the one thing I'll say at least

2228
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:04,090
my understanding of RFC 66 35 is like a

2229
01:46:01,989 --> 01:46:06,129
very strong presumption of delegation to

2230
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:08,880
the are sock for all of these matters

2231
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:11,050
and I think that was by design

2232
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:13,870
like why would you have two committees

2233
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:16,239
overseeing you know having any oversight

2234
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:18,040
role over a single individual if they

2235
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:20,019
weren't supposed to have functionally

2236
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,960
different roles so I think that's part

2237
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:24,730
of what gets to your question is that

2238
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:26,890
there was a there's a strong level of

2239
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:28,269
Independence and delegation between Ivy

2240
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:29,460
and our site at least as I've understood

2241
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:32,460
it

2242
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:33,930
from the war and the RFC thank you and I

2243
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:37,110
think it goes to some of the roll

2244
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:38,820
definition and assumptions and they seem

2245
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:42,269
to be a little bit different through the

2246
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:42,690
room so now you're next thank you very

2247
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:45,630
much

2248
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:48,509
this question is for Lissa as you go

2249
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:51,210
forward you've asked us to think about

2250
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:54,930
going forward and I'd like to see what

2251
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:57,090
your arc isn't going forward Alyssa we

2252
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:59,640
had a and I near in a unique position

2253
01:46:57,090 --> 01:47:02,040
since you said both on the is G and Ivy

2254
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:06,989
and I'm sure Ted I'd love to hear this

2255
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:09,440
from you but we had an RF C++ bought to

2256
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:12,629
work on our main output which is RFC's

2257
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:16,259
what was your conclusion from that off

2258
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:18,620
and how did you come to it just if you

2259
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:24,930
chair the reasoning it would help maybe

2260
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:26,580
tell us what you're thinking about sure

2261
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:28,650
I mean I think it was it was a bit more

2262
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:32,100
of an IB initiative than anything else

2263
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:35,610
but I think I think it was very clear

2264
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:37,890
feedback from the boss that the topics

2265
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:40,349
that were raised were squarely in the

2266
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:42,750
province of the RFC series editor and

2267
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:46,560
she agreed to take them on and work on

2268
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:48,330
them and I think that was I mean in the

2269
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,469
realm of you know clarity of results

2270
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:51,570
from above it's one of the clearest

2271
01:47:49,469 --> 01:47:53,670
results I've seen so that was good

2272
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:55,380
outcome I think you know the bluff

2273
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:57,510
itself was extremely divisive and that's

2274
01:47:55,380 --> 01:48:00,120
why I've you know talked about it as

2275
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:02,310
having been a mistake because I think it

2276
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:04,620
created you know a lot of strife that

2277
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:06,719
was unnecessary but in terms of like

2278
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:10,469
further follow-up it's it's entirely in

2279
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:12,719
in the RC series editor's Court so as

2280
01:48:10,469 --> 01:48:15,239
we're transitioning yeah did you feel

2281
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:19,200
the directions that Heather outlined

2282
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:21,480
were the appropriate directions she

2283
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:24,540
outlined several things she thought next

2284
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:27,030
or even this time she outlined all 48

2285
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:30,660
does that seem to be the same sort of

2286
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:32,969
thing you foresee for the future um I

2287
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:36,239
don't think the our 48 topic was really

2288
01:48:32,969 --> 01:48:38,760
related to the boss no I was just giving

2289
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:41,580
it as an example that you might

2290
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,720
elucidate what things you felt enough

2291
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:47,640
off would be

2292
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:50,070
going forward what has two things so

2293
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:51,750
yeah so so I don't think the operate

2294
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:56,969
topic was related to the Boff but I will

2295
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:59,400
say that as far back as year-and-a-half

2296
01:48:56,970 --> 01:49:03,210
ago Heather and I were talking about the

2297
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:05,820
the RPC performance evaluation and this

2298
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:08,450
was the main topic that that came up

2299
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:13,290
that it would be great to get going on

2300
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:16,920
revisions to our 48 and you know I knew

2301
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:19,200
that it was sort of as the next project

2302
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,210
after the the format transition so from

2303
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:23,730
my personal individual perspective I

2304
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:26,550
think that's that seems like a fantastic

2305
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:28,469
next project but it's not really I mean

2306
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:29,850
my opinion isn't really the one that

2307
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:31,770
matters it kind of depends on the

2308
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:33,570
community and you know what the

2309
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:35,880
population of people who are working in

2310
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:38,099
the IETF stream want so I'll be

2311
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:40,110
interested to see if it's a project of

2312
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:42,120
interest to other people those sounds

2313
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:45,599
are the tactical I was hoping for a

2314
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:48,570
strategic helmet but thank you I'm sure

2315
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:51,510
maybe you give us some strategic forward

2316
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:56,400
how we make the stream more effective

2317
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:58,050
more than just the process anchor sure

2318
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,160
yeah the strategy for the RFC series is

2319
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:05,220
not my responsibility

2320
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:07,800
okay so I think Tony is next nope I'm

2321
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:11,250
not sure isn't maybe it's me all right

2322
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:15,270
play if you want something or somebody

2323
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:18,750
else no it's you have I'll go so earlier

2324
01:50:15,270 --> 01:50:20,940
today Sara sent out an email to the ITF

2325
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:22,020
list with an apology from your sake and

2326
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:24,450
I just want to say to you that I think

2327
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,980
that was a standard thing to do and

2328
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:29,639
thank you for it I think it sets a very

2329
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:31,709
good example there was a couple of

2330
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:34,980
things in that email that caught my eye

2331
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:38,310
and one of them was talk about how the

2332
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:41,299
current situation came to be as a result

2333
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:44,460
of wanting to test out an RLC process

2334
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:47,040
because there was some uncertainty

2335
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:48,840
around sort of earlier application of it

2336
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,920
and as somebody who's

2337
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:55,740
does this for a living managing RFA's

2338
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,730
has a large bottom line vehicle there's

2339
01:50:55,740 --> 01:51:00,420
no such thing as

2340
01:50:56,730 --> 01:51:02,820
to test the north RFP process you will

2341
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:06,480
run it or you don't

2342
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:09,450
and in the kind of contracts that they

2343
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:12,360
are the various parts of the

2344
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:16,230
organization manages all none of them as

2345
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:19,019
far as I can see or for no square meters

2346
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:21,299
something the standard service it's all

2347
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:23,220
special-purpose it's all you know one

2348
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:26,040
offs in various forms and shapes and you

2349
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:28,200
have to be very much more careful when

2350
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:30,990
you've managed and by those kinds of

2351
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:33,630
services so what I'm here to ask is are

2352
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:37,200
there anything is there anything else on

2353
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:39,150
the table so you know that we should be

2354
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:42,090
worried about you know are we gonna be

2355
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:45,150
here in Singapore or in Vancouver

2356
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:46,980
looking at other breakage because there

2357
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:49,530
are other people in the community who

2358
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:53,480
are affected by contracts not

2359
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:56,519
peopletools team not all of them are

2360
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:58,379
reimbursed directly or contracted but a

2361
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:01,830
lot of them are affected by contracts

2362
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:03,570
that the current ITF Edition is

2363
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:04,380
negotiating in various sort of

2364
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:06,570
constellations

2365
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:10,200
I also will make sure that we learn from

2366
01:52:06,570 --> 01:52:13,950
this not only in the RFC future RFC

2367
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:16,769
process or the future hiring of this

2368
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:20,639
particular function but in other parts

2369
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:23,370
of the organization so we don't break

2370
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:25,650
anything else thank you for your comment

2371
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:28,710
and I think the good news is that none

2372
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:31,280
of the other contracts are held in quite

2373
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:34,400
this way where there's this

2374
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:38,490
recommendation appointment and then

2375
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:40,049
referrals of the ap2 the LLC I think

2376
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:42,900
there are mostly a good bit simpler than

2377
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:44,910
this but I'm sure that the LSE board

2378
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:46,410
members here who who are listening are

2379
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:49,950
listening to the point you've made and

2380
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:51,660
we'll try and avoid making this error

2381
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:54,000
because there were a couple of Sarah

2382
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:57,450
actually had a couple of points in our

2383
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,880
one of them was you know we we're

2384
01:52:57,450 --> 01:53:01,470
looking at a an RFC where we don't

2385
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:05,930
understand what's going on we need to

2386
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:08,430
test it and RFP that's a Freudian slip

2387
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:09,600
we're looking at an RFC we don't know

2388
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:11,490
why

2389
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:13,440
go as expected last time we're going to

2390
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:16,710
test it I think that's your number one

2391
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:18,870
mistake right the number two mistake of

2392
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:21,540
course is not communicating properly

2393
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:23,250
right and I'm not actually directing

2394
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:26,550
this essay of course I'm directing it at

2395
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:29,370
the entire historic edition so what my

2396
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:30,930
ITF LLC had on lesson I learned was to

2397
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:32,940
call your contractors and thank them and

2398
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:35,100
make sure that okay yeah let's talk a

2399
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:37,230
bit I mean all right so I did do that

2400
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:41,880
and my final point I've done the same

2401
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:44,219
thing with vendors that I manage I you

2402
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:46,170
know not to extend their contract when I

2403
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:48,360
had the option I've never done that when

2404
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:53,670
I was in work was happy with the vendor

2405
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:55,410
never ever we hear you and we I think

2406
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:58,040
you'd seen from Sarah and from the

2407
01:53:55,410 --> 01:54:02,370
arishok that wasn't the intent and the

2408
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:06,260
apologize sorry I going to the back Mike

2409
01:54:02,370 --> 01:54:13,740
is that Ron yeah that's Ron sorry sorry

2410
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:15,350
okay then then Mike and then Ron Mike

2411
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:18,330
you need to get a little bit closer

2412
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:20,130
I've been trying okay that close I've

2413
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:21,570
been trying to get a Mike st. John's

2414
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:23,220
I've been trying to get an idea of the

2415
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:25,309
time line here and we've been working

2416
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:28,710
our way back through all this stuff

2417
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:31,680
could the IAB members of the are sock

2418
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:36,440
identifying themselves please okay cool

2419
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:39,870
so I went back I can look at the IRA see

2420
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:42,750
our sock minions and there were only two

2421
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:47,010
discussions on this particular topic one

2422
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:49,020
of them was that because the I sock HR

2423
01:54:47,010 --> 01:54:51,960
person back in 2005 that said you may

2424
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:53,790
not evaluate the contractor you would

2425
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:57,110
come up with a you must develop you're

2426
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:59,400
going to evaluate the contract but

2427
01:54:57,110 --> 01:55:02,250
someplace in the middle of this you

2428
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:05,009
basically went off and and and decided

2429
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:08,940
that the evaluation the contract was

2430
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:11,430
also to do a rebid so who in this

2431
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:14,519
process was the prime mover for the

2432
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:16,890
rebid and what discussions were done

2433
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:19,770
besides it looks like the last meeting

2434
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:23,510
and maybe two moons prior and that topic

2435
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:24,889
was just the evaluation criteria snaring

2436
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:27,019
help just because it was listed as

2437
01:55:24,889 --> 01:55:29,059
executive session so let me let me

2438
01:55:27,019 --> 01:55:30,469
caution you about something related to

2439
01:55:29,059 --> 01:55:31,820
the executive session in addition of

2440
01:55:30,469 --> 01:55:34,699
course to the executive session there

2441
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:36,139
it's an executive equivalent mailing

2442
01:55:34,699 --> 01:55:37,549
list so you're probably not seeing the

2443
01:55:36,139 --> 01:55:39,409
full record because some of it may have

2444
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:42,320
been since it is a personnel or a

2445
01:55:39,409 --> 01:55:44,839
contract matter on on this so please

2446
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:46,460
understand that because we have to treat

2447
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:49,190
these as confidential even when the

2448
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:51,230
intent is to be laudatory toward the

2449
01:55:49,190 --> 01:55:54,199
person some of this is not in the public

2450
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:56,058
record and can't be put there now going

2451
01:55:54,199 --> 01:56:03,710
back to the timeline question christian

2452
01:55:56,059 --> 01:56:06,559
do you think that was batana is what you

2453
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:08,780
said it was discussed in the last three

2454
01:56:06,559 --> 01:56:11,510
months about no more and it was

2455
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:13,429
discussed at one meeting and you came up

2456
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:18,829
with the decision to do delivered in one

2457
01:56:13,429 --> 01:56:21,349
meeting we had discussion before and we

2458
01:56:18,829 --> 01:56:25,940
were really concerned that the RFP is

2459
01:56:21,349 --> 01:56:27,559
only produced one bead that has a year

2460
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:29,808
and a half prior when did that

2461
01:56:27,559 --> 01:56:35,869
discussion happen no those discussions

2462
01:56:29,809 --> 01:56:37,610
happen in May okay so could I ask you to

2463
01:56:35,869 --> 01:56:40,190
clarify why you think that timeline is

2464
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:42,920
particularly the primary issue here I'm

2465
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:46,190
trying to figure out how much thought

2466
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:50,119
went into this process of deciding to do

2467
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:54,129
this and I'm I'm trying to make sure we

2468
01:56:50,119 --> 01:56:59,420
don't end up with a oh let's just do a

2469
01:56:54,130 --> 01:57:01,010
the RFP without you know just somebody

2470
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:04,010
randomly deciding to do this so I need

2471
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:10,309
to understand was there any discussion

2472
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:11,840
of this and the impact of the rebid and

2473
01:57:10,309 --> 01:57:14,659
I'm not seeing that in there in the

2474
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:16,610
record so and I think what you normally

2475
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:18,759
see in this case is the output and I

2476
01:57:16,610 --> 01:57:21,829
think I've talked to you about this on

2477
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:24,320
here because this is something where it

2478
01:57:21,829 --> 01:57:26,808
relates to a contract or in similar

2479
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:29,599
cases with personnel matters you

2480
01:57:26,809 --> 01:57:31,760
normally judge aids by by output not by

2481
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:33,349
rehearsing the discussion in public and

2482
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,230
in this case the output was a

2483
01:57:33,349 --> 01:57:36,960
recommendation for renewal now this was

2484
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:39,389
a consensus

2485
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,969
recommendation from the entire are gonna

2486
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:44,910
go on and in addition to that

2487
01:57:41,969 --> 01:57:47,219
recommendation for renewal they brought

2488
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:49,260
back up an issue that had occurred in

2489
01:57:47,219 --> 01:57:52,910
including in discussions from Heather

2490
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:55,500
that the last time that they had sought

2491
01:57:52,910 --> 01:58:02,900
candidates they'd received only one and

2492
01:57:55,500 --> 01:58:05,730
at the same time decided to make a a

2493
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:07,080
concerted effort over the following two

2494
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:09,030
years to figure out what had happened

2495
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:11,550
and see if they could issue another RP

2496
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:14,280
now we've we've noted in the previous

2497
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:17,070
things here that was certainly a mistake

2498
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:18,360
in communication in communicating those

2499
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:21,660
at the same time completely

2500
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:24,210
misunderstood as something that was

2501
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:26,610
reflective of Heather's performance

2502
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:30,180
despite it having caveats about that in

2503
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:32,040
it that's that's mistaken I think sarah

2504
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:33,960
has been very clear about that it was

2505
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:37,860
also something where I think in response

2506
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:39,890
to leave we we certainly agree that

2507
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:44,610
that's not how this should have gone

2508
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:46,080
that instead we understand that what we

2509
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:49,739
should have done here and this is a

2510
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:52,410
fraud we is make sure that everybody was

2511
01:58:49,739 --> 01:58:55,080
on board with that process including

2512
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:56,460
Heather before making the decision to do

2513
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:59,219
the rienne perhaps including the

2514
01:58:56,460 --> 01:59:00,950
community including the community as

2515
01:58:59,219 --> 01:59:03,270
well but at that point in the process

2516
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:05,969
the only part that had happened was the

2517
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:07,739
Arisaka recommendation and then the

2518
01:59:05,969 --> 01:59:10,230
heiress's resignation so some bits of

2519
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:11,790
this that might have corrected this and

2520
01:59:10,230 --> 01:59:14,309
it would be kind of fanciful to assume

2521
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:16,019
that we actually got this right didn't

2522
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:19,170
happen and that's where it went wrong

2523
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:21,360
and did the IAB at that time reach out

2524
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:24,950
to Heather to request to reconsider

2525
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:28,650
while this was still private so the

2526
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:30,510
information came to the IAB I mean

2527
01:59:28,650 --> 01:59:33,480
pretty much at exactly the same time

2528
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:36,870
that she told the LLC for Sarah did

2529
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:39,299
reach out to her right away I sent her

2530
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:41,610
an email personally but off list saying

2531
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:43,230
thank you for your service and intended

2532
01:59:41,610 --> 01:59:45,389
to reach out to her after I got back

2533
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:47,129
from the dead or workshop but to discuss

2534
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:48,600
further but because it was a you know

2535
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:50,840
literally in Helsinki on the plane

2536
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:53,180
getting on a plane I couldn't get

2537
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:55,220
but you know it is definitely the case

2538
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:57,260
that we have heard that this did not go

2539
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,910
right and we will see what we can do to

2540
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:02,050
make sure that it is structurally

2541
01:59:58,910 --> 02:00:08,900
prevented from failing in this way again

2542
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:10,490
from three comments first thanks to Olaf

2543
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:13,219
for his slides they make a very

2544
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:15,790
complicated process look really easy and

2545
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:18,650
it looks like a process that should run

2546
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:21,380
second is I don't think we're quite

2547
02:00:18,650 --> 02:00:24,559
ready to put out an RFP yet and the

2548
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:27,770
reason why this process looks like it

2549
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:32,330
should run well it didn't it failed in a

2550
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:34,100
spectacular way people are standing

2551
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:36,740
around the microphone are trying to

2552
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:40,760
debug the process now what happened one

2553
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:43,580
went wrong probably the people who can

2554
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:46,250
debug the process best are the ones who

2555
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:48,650
executed it they should probably do a

2556
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:51,430
post-mortem figure out what went wrong

2557
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:55,219
who made the mistakes be honest about it

2558
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:58,130
we learn from our mistakes the next

2559
02:00:55,220 --> 02:01:03,350
thing is and we undo the damage is it

2560
02:00:58,130 --> 02:01:06,470
possible if not can we at least admit to

2561
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:08,330
the mistakes and not repeat them once we

2562
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:11,300
understand where the process went wrong

2563
02:01:08,330 --> 02:01:13,490
we can make sure we don't do it again

2564
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:17,360
but we shouldn't leap into the process

2565
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:21,910
again until we understand why the router

2566
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:24,769
crashed thank you for the feedback Wyatt

2567
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:27,050
I'm gonna apologize for this I kind of

2568
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:28,910
wasn't tracking who was that microphone

2569
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:30,980
at what time so I'm just gonna call them

2570
02:01:28,910 --> 02:01:31,760
serially Patrick you're next and then it

2571
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:34,429
will be Bob

2572
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:36,620
thanks Ted I'm going to try and be

2573
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:37,430
responsive to the question of where do

2574
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:40,160
we go from here

2575
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:44,750
all right provide some input into that I

2576
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:48,730
think the core issue of of what we have

2577
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:52,130
to deal with right now is a result of

2578
02:01:48,730 --> 02:01:54,650
asking the RSC to simultaneously deal

2579
02:01:52,130 --> 02:01:56,630
with these issues of strategy and

2580
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:58,280
administration and it's not surprising

2581
02:01:56,630 --> 02:02:01,100
when you think about what the core work

2582
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:02,990
product of the IETF is and how

2583
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:04,070
leadership is responsible for greasing

2584
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:09,409
the wheels to make that

2585
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:11,119
and that the RSC is the Nexus of a lot

2586
02:02:09,409 --> 02:02:13,610
of discussions about not only the

2587
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:16,070
strategic evolution series but also you

2588
02:02:13,610 --> 02:02:20,089
know the SLA is that may be behind the

2589
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:21,799
format that everyone wants yesterday NFV

2590
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:23,750
I started was not responsive to that I

2591
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:26,449
would be at the mic say hey what about

2592
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:29,329
the SLA is ready because that's what I

2593
02:02:26,449 --> 02:02:31,848
need is output from my work when I when

2594
02:02:29,329 --> 02:02:35,509
I come here so that creates this

2595
02:02:31,849 --> 02:02:37,489
inherent tension and we should deal with

2596
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:38,810
that rather than putting a new person

2597
02:02:37,489 --> 02:02:42,250
immediately in the place where the same

2598
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:44,179
tension exists and I think the strategic

2599
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:46,190
aren't sorry I think the more

2600
02:02:44,179 --> 02:02:48,860
operational parts of a heart see have

2601
02:02:46,190 --> 02:02:50,299
you know in many ways being moved after

2602
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:51,949
the production centre and the publisher

2603
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:53,929
has up here in the slides

2604
02:02:51,949 --> 02:02:55,519
forgive my hesitation talking here the

2605
02:02:53,929 --> 02:03:00,770
feedback here is amazing at this

2606
02:02:55,520 --> 02:03:02,239
microphone this the operational courts

2607
02:03:00,770 --> 02:03:04,550
that have largely been moved out and I

2608
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:06,379
think you know the RFC's will continue

2609
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:08,599
to flow should this position being

2610
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:11,380
vacant for you know a period short

2611
02:03:08,599 --> 02:03:14,840
period of time while we deal with the

2612
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:16,730
harder strategic questions and then once

2613
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:18,500
you if you manage to separate those

2614
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:22,459
roles you can ask the question I've

2615
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:24,230
heard wildly divergent opinions on how

2616
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:25,820
you structure someone that is only

2617
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:28,129
dealing with strategic questions there

2618
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:29,480
right have we now created a leadership

2619
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:32,210
position that was a lot like the other

2620
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:35,269
leadership positions we have and so

2621
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:36,530
there shouldn't be you know a hired or a

2622
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:38,389
contracted position there should be an

2623
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:40,190
appointed position you know and then you

2624
02:03:38,389 --> 02:03:41,869
have more appeared kind of relationship

2625
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:44,119
and as soon as you create that other

2626
02:03:41,869 --> 02:03:45,829
model you necessarily bring management

2627
02:03:44,119 --> 02:03:47,690
into that is that attention that's not

2628
02:03:45,829 --> 02:03:47,929
survivable can you cut off enough of

2629
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:50,598
that

2630
02:03:47,929 --> 02:03:51,889
so that's leadership more consistent the

2631
02:03:50,599 --> 02:03:53,929
model we already do

2632
02:03:51,889 --> 02:03:54,829
I'm not asking us all that tonight but

2633
02:03:53,929 --> 02:03:57,139
I'm saying like those are the questions

2634
02:03:54,829 --> 02:03:59,750
I would like to see solved before we

2635
02:03:57,139 --> 02:04:04,210
jump into the new you know watching

2636
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:07,880
relationship thank you for the feedback

2637
02:04:04,210 --> 02:04:11,530
so regrettably I was standing at the mic

2638
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:14,329
the last time we were here in the SoCal

2639
02:04:11,530 --> 02:04:16,750
talking about what happened at the at

2640
02:04:14,329 --> 02:04:18,940
the RFC plus ba

2641
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:22,920
and it's only getting worse I mean this

2642
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:25,750
is me you're the management of this

2643
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:28,900
oversight and this has been a giant

2644
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:31,300
failure I you know Oh

2645
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:32,469
all his presentation was quite good and

2646
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:35,110
you know he said something very

2647
02:04:32,469 --> 02:04:37,420
important he said the are sock was

2648
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:40,540
supposed to be the people with the long

2649
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:43,270
term history in this so things didn't

2650
02:04:40,540 --> 02:04:45,340
change very quickly I mean that's that

2651
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:48,820
was the intent in setting this up and

2652
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:50,290
when you when the IAB decided to cycle a

2653
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:53,009
whole bunch of people in the are sock

2654
02:04:50,290 --> 02:04:57,160
you lost all of that and that's I think

2655
02:04:53,010 --> 02:05:00,550
what led to the events that caused us to

2656
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:03,849
lose a really good person who you know

2657
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:06,280
to lose Heather it was a series of

2658
02:05:03,850 --> 02:05:09,850
errors that you know come back to a

2659
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:12,099
bunch of things the IB did so where I'm

2660
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:14,320
going with this is I have no confidence

2661
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:18,670
that the current Arts Hawk and the

2662
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:22,509
current IB are going to bring us run the

2663
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:24,640
process to get us the next RFC editor in

2664
02:05:22,510 --> 02:05:26,890
the way we want I think there's going to

2665
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:29,469
have to be some significant changes in

2666
02:05:26,890 --> 02:05:31,060
this to get the right set of people

2667
02:05:29,469 --> 02:05:34,660
involved in this so we get a good

2668
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:36,760
outcome thanks for your comments a

2669
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:41,260
couple of clarifying comments for me and

2670
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:43,390
then just the way the IB program

2671
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:44,980
structures are worked not just for our

2672
02:05:43,390 --> 02:05:47,350
sake which is one of the oldest and

2673
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:50,589
bestest drug but all of them isn't to

2674
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:52,719
try and keep the history in the people

2675
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:56,110
in the program but to keep the history

2676
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:58,810
in the structure of the program the idea

2677
02:05:56,110 --> 02:06:02,009
is that by creating the structured

2678
02:05:58,810 --> 02:06:05,980
program that lasts longer than any IAB

2679
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:08,110
two-year term that the there are always

2680
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:12,280
enough people in it who have been in it

2681
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:13,989
long enough that the the structures of

2682
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:17,139
the program keep things going in this

2683
02:06:13,989 --> 02:06:19,599
case the IB did do a refresh that called

2684
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:21,790
for new people but it actually kept

2685
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:26,140
three people with a total of eleven

2686
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:28,810
years of experience in the MARSOC so I

2687
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:30,250
think it's important to note that they

2688
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:34,420
weren't

2689
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:35,920
either going and using this in a way

2690
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,450
where we were not going and using this

2691
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:41,590
in a way so it's different from the

2692
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:44,200
other IAB structures or that the the

2693
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:45,970
people who stayed in the ours Hawk

2694
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:47,950
hadn't been there some significant

2695
02:06:45,970 --> 02:06:50,170
period of time what I do think is a very

2696
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:51,700
important strategic question and I

2697
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:53,890
certainly agree with you that we should

2698
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:56,620
deal with is whether this is still the

2699
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:59,770
right structure it may very well be that

2700
02:06:56,620 --> 02:07:02,410
having an arse off that is directly

2701
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:05,680
appointed by the NomCom or from some

2702
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:07,330
other mechanism that's tied to the the

2703
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:10,630
stream managers or some other thing may

2704
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:12,370
be a better solution now I think the

2705
02:07:10,630 --> 02:07:15,550
most important thing that we can do from

2706
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:20,490
this point though is to figure out how

2707
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:24,730
we get to that strategy and if it is not

2708
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:27,309
run the the RFP process and hire

2709
02:07:24,730 --> 02:07:28,990
somebody to help us then we have to

2710
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:30,940
understand it will take some time for

2711
02:07:28,990 --> 02:07:36,450
the community to come to consensus on

2712
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:36,450
what the new strategy ought to be Eric

2713
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:42,150
I'm just gonna do the oh yeah there's

2714
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:45,070
there's I can't sorry I have a few notes

2715
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:47,200
so um I was interested to hear the

2716
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:50,650
discussion of what people's conceptions

2717
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:52,290
of 6235 ons intention are sacra um I

2718
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:54,400
went back and reviewed the material on

2719
02:07:52,290 --> 02:07:55,510
as I assume though the documents

2720
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:58,540
actually document what they're supposed

2721
02:07:55,510 --> 02:08:00,190
to document so I mean this was like a

2722
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:02,440
pretty classic oversight function to me

2723
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:04,000
has like due diligence and your view

2724
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:06,129
candidate selection all those things

2725
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,480
it's like if someone gave me like the

2726
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:09,880
definition oversight that's what I'd

2727
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:11,919
expect and and so it's what I expect the

2728
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:13,300
IV to do for the artsy function and it's

2729
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,740
what I expect they given they choose to

2730
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:16,120
delegate that to our software the

2731
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:18,190
community's chosen delegate it to our

2732
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:19,269
sake and with I be overseeing them

2733
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:22,330
that's what I suspect our psyche to do

2734
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:24,130
so I certainly think I be responsible

2735
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:26,170
looking to be further altima decisions

2736
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:27,610
but I certainly would not be happy if

2737
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:29,050
what that you know the output of this

2738
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:31,299
was that the our sock and the i-beam

2739
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:32,440
every time they made a decision have to

2740
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,610
like about the community or validation

2741
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:35,080
of every individual decision that seems

2742
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:37,059
non-functional on the structure we have

2743
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:38,320
in this community is we trust the

2744
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:39,790
leadership to do things and then we

2745
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:41,349
don't when they don't do them we have

2746
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:43,030
structures removing them in various ways

2747
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:45,480
we don't assume that

2748
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:47,889
check everything with the community um

2749
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:49,539
so if you speak a little bit slower oh

2750
02:08:47,889 --> 02:08:55,809
I'm sorry yes I thought we were running

2751
02:08:49,539 --> 02:08:57,940
out of time we are running tight on time

2752
02:08:55,809 --> 02:09:03,389
but we are also trying to listen I'm

2753
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:06,759
sorry should I start in the beginning

2754
02:09:03,389 --> 02:09:09,489
okay um a second thing I want to say is

2755
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:11,949
I want to district thank you for you to

2756
02:09:09,489 --> 02:09:13,989
say earlier about the sort of structures

2757
02:09:11,949 --> 02:09:16,000
that we use for continuity um it's

2758
02:09:13,989 --> 02:09:17,650
really not a viable system to assume

2759
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,510
that continuity has to reside in like a

2760
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:23,199
few individuals who can carry on forever

2761
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:24,400
um it doesn't work and I mean we made

2762
02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:25,690
this mistake in the IDF over and over

2763
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,610
again we like think that like bits of it

2764
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:29,799
exactly right person in and like like

2765
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:32,110
the way one goes like a viable long-term

2766
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:34,360
system is by having structures not by

2767
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:36,308
having the great man or great woman

2768
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:37,598
theory of history this is from my

2769
02:09:36,309 --> 02:09:40,000
experience and the companies I've worked

2770
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:43,750
in that doesn't really survivable as

2771
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,880
people leave finally um I think it is

2772
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:47,889
clear from this interaction that the

2773
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:49,750
structure and that sort of grand

2774
02:09:47,889 --> 02:09:51,820
strategy of what the RSC system then

2775
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:54,849
those boxes on the screen perhaps and

2776
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:56,469
may need some rethink um I was heartened

2777
02:09:54,849 --> 02:09:58,000
to hear Patrick um say that you know

2778
02:09:56,469 --> 02:09:59,590
that if we don't solve this problem

2779
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,869
right away the RSC's will continue to

2780
02:09:59,590 --> 02:10:05,639
flow and I grew that I mean that's what

2781
02:10:01,869 --> 02:10:07,769
we're here so on the RFC's must flow so

2782
02:10:05,639 --> 02:10:10,690
yeah I thought you'd like that

2783
02:10:07,770 --> 02:10:11,050
so so I think certainly on that gives us

2784
02:10:10,690 --> 02:10:16,388
some time

2785
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:18,039
um it's not like an emergency um the so

2786
02:10:16,389 --> 02:10:19,809
I think you know we have a broad scale

2787
02:10:18,039 --> 02:10:21,250
we have sort of two options um one I

2788
02:10:19,809 --> 02:10:23,530
think the one that Ron just indicated

2789
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:25,179
which is take a pause and don't appoint

2790
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:26,259
anybody new for a little while and sort

2791
02:10:25,179 --> 02:10:28,869
of try to sort out the community with

2792
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:30,940
the RFC with the star shard B and the

2793
02:10:28,869 --> 02:10:33,549
second is on you know to appoint

2794
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:34,750
somebody um for a shorter term perhaps

2795
02:10:33,550 --> 02:10:36,699
you can help us sort out what that would

2796
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:38,590
it be and run the RC process is

2797
02:10:36,699 --> 02:10:40,119
indicated to see 3035 to pick that

2798
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:41,230
person go with the expectation that

2799
02:10:40,119 --> 02:10:42,820
we're going to sort things out rather

2800
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:44,769
than that like that they're fitting into

2801
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:47,710
some long-term panel structure I think

2802
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:49,659
either those would be viable um but I

2803
02:10:47,710 --> 02:10:50,949
think clearly whatever it is like we do

2804
02:10:49,659 --> 02:10:52,030
you know ask the question is this the

2805
02:10:50,949 --> 02:10:54,638
right strategy and truckster going

2806
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:56,320
forward thank you thank you I understand

2807
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:59,619
Heather would like to say something

2808
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:04,780
mm-hmm so with regards to RFC's flowing

2809
02:10:59,619 --> 02:11:07,239
absolutely a priority there we'll so yes

2810
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:08,590
I have a very tactical role and the RSC

2811
02:11:07,239 --> 02:11:11,650
else is a very strategic role the

2812
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:14,199
tactical role is an immediate need that

2813
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:16,269
you need to consider we we've been

2814
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:18,040
talking about the format change there's

2815
02:11:16,270 --> 02:11:19,869
going to be day-to-day questions about

2816
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:21,420
how do we handle different things that

2817
02:11:19,869 --> 02:11:25,150
will need to be answered

2818
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:30,880
ongoing and fairly quickly we've already

2819
02:11:25,150 --> 02:11:32,348
added a new state in the database so

2820
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:34,000
that we can track you know as we track

2821
02:11:32,349 --> 02:11:36,400
at a time we tracked ahrefs the editor

2822
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,949
time we track off 48 time and now we're

2823
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:40,540
going to track tools time where

2824
02:11:38,949 --> 02:11:42,400
something is stuck in a state where the

2825
02:11:40,540 --> 02:11:46,540
tools aren't quite right that they need

2826
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:48,429
to change regardless of the long term

2827
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:50,110
direction that the organization takes

2828
02:11:48,429 --> 02:11:52,300
and I do suspect you need to spend some

2829
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:53,739
quality time with that someone needs to

2830
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:56,530
be able to help the RSC production

2831
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:58,959
Center with those day-to-day what about

2832
02:11:56,530 --> 02:12:01,269
this field so please keep that in mind

2833
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,889
so can I ask you this question in a

2834
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:04,630
slightly more direct fashion then is it

2835
02:12:02,889 --> 02:12:08,730
your advice to the community that we do

2836
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:11,610
not pause the RFP but we do seek to hire

2837
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:16,989
at it even if it's only temporarily

2838
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:21,040
successor rse at this time no I think

2839
02:12:16,989 --> 02:12:23,440
having trying to find per telling the

2840
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:26,469
tools team perhaps to to take this part

2841
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:28,500
and run it I think trying to find an

2842
02:12:26,469 --> 02:12:30,790
interim person is going to be wildly

2843
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:33,070
difficult for anyone you bring in for

2844
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:34,989
them to be able to do that job we run an

2845
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:40,090
XML vocabulary that's like nothing else

2846
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:42,730
in the world so the I don't see you be

2847
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:44,230
able to find an expertise to do this

2848
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:48,040
role I think you'll need to get it from

2849
02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:49,629
within the community and then spend some

2850
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:50,860
time with the bigger picture of what do

2851
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:52,599
you actually want to hire for going

2852
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:53,259
forward I see thank you for the

2853
02:12:52,599 --> 02:12:55,840
clarification

2854
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:57,670
I think Richard you were next Richard

2855
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:59,710
Lawrence I'm sorry I'd like to sound a

2856
02:12:57,670 --> 02:13:01,300
bit of a note of positivity and thank

2857
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:03,550
the I'd be in the are sock for the

2858
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:05,409
oversight they've been do it to me

2859
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:07,270
oversight is about back Nia when you're

2860
02:13:05,409 --> 02:13:08,769
in oversight of the role it's about

2861
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:09,860
backstopping that role and paying

2862
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:11,360
attention to find

2863
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:13,339
there might be question marks or things

2864
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:15,769
signs that things might be detention and

2865
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:19,310
I think that's what I've seen out of the

2866
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:21,680
IBNR sock is fulfilling that role but

2867
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:23,170
thinking back the last few times I've

2868
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:26,510
been at this plenary my concluding

2869
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:29,540
perhaps like right on this spot have

2870
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:31,580
been expressing concerns about you know

2871
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:34,460
ways the RFC seasons to evolve whether

2872
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:36,620
that's in terms of SLA violations or

2873
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:38,330
speed of processing or in terms of

2874
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:40,610
reaching out stakeholder communities the

2875
02:13:38,330 --> 02:13:42,170
consumers of RFC's so I think there

2876
02:13:40,610 --> 02:13:44,059
there have been question marks that come

2877
02:13:42,170 --> 02:13:45,740
through and I think it's it's the duty

2878
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:48,080
of the oversight bodies to be looking

2879
02:13:45,740 --> 02:13:50,240
into those and taking a look and so I

2880
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:52,519
like to thank the Arisaka my abhi for

2881
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:53,900
doing that and invite them to continue

2882
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:56,660
fulfilling the role that they've been

2883
02:13:53,900 --> 02:14:00,290
charged with in the irrelevant RFC's and

2884
02:13:56,660 --> 02:14:01,700
so in that regard I kind of disagree

2885
02:14:00,290 --> 02:14:03,410
with this idea there's been a deep

2886
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:05,809
structural failure I think if we've had

2887
02:14:03,410 --> 02:14:07,099
a disagreements and there's been

2888
02:14:05,810 --> 02:14:09,200
unfortunate consequences of that

2889
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:10,460
disagreements and we'll need to come

2890
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,440
together as a community and think about

2891
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:14,390
how to move forward and come to better

2892
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:15,469
consensus on how we should operate in

2893
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:17,330
the future and avoid these sorts of

2894
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:18,800
disagreements in the future but I don't

2895
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:20,450
think there's a kind of deep structural

2896
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:23,600
failing that's awesome what they

2897
02:14:20,450 --> 02:14:25,610
speakers have mentioned and so in that

2898
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:27,170
framing I'm a bit more optimistic some

2899
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:28,759
other folks about our ability to carry

2900
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:31,100
on here and kind of stay the course

2901
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:33,260
I think I'm broadly agree with the two

2902
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:35,420
alternatives it is we have kind of a

2903
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:37,730
brief Raja Torah and it takes some time

2904
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:39,800
in breathing room you have a vacancy of

2905
02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:42,110
all use a community to discuss this but

2906
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:43,700
I also think that I'm slightly more

2907
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:45,620
persuaded by the case that we should go

2908
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:46,700
ahead and try and find an instruments as

2909
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:48,080
Heather points out there's some

2910
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:48,410
operational issues that need attending

2911
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:50,720
to

2912
02:14:48,410 --> 02:14:52,190
I think it would also be useful to have

2913
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:55,460
someone in that role to kind of guide

2914
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:57,110
the community consider discussion and be

2915
02:14:55,460 --> 02:14:58,880
kind of a focus point for this

2916
02:14:57,110 --> 02:15:03,650
conversation as we discuss the evolution

2917
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:05,360
going forward so yeah I think I've again

2918
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:08,030
I'd like to thank the IAB in the arishok

2919
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:10,040
and I think you know either of these two

2920
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:11,599
options he's acceptable but I haven't

2921
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:13,000
slight preference for going ahead and

2922
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:15,320
putting a candidate in the spot okay

2923
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,120
thanks for expressing your preference

2924
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:19,849
Aaron Aaron Falk

2925
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:23,059
so I completely disagree with rich I

2926
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:24,110
think there's been a failure here

2927
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:26,000
you need to be a little bit closer with

2928
02:15:24,110 --> 02:15:28,429
Mike here okay he takes my second to

2929
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,180
turn the volume up so I think there's

2930
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:34,460
been a failure here I disagree with rich

2931
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:37,670
first let me apologize to you publicly

2932
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:40,240
Ted if you felt that I was harassing you

2933
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:42,980
on the ITF list I got some feedback that

2934
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:44,900
maybe I wasn't clear with what I was

2935
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:48,129
trying to get to and I was trying really

2936
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:51,259
hard to not put words in your mouth but

2937
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:52,820
I did I was asking you know did the ID

2938
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:53,720
think anything went wrong was there

2939
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:55,130
anything that could have done

2940
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:57,050
differently and I think that there were

2941
02:15:55,130 --> 02:15:59,360
things that the ID did wrong and could

2942
02:15:57,050 --> 02:16:01,670
have done differently but first the

2943
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:05,860
response was there was nothing wrong the

2944
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:08,210
idea was regretful then you said that

2945
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:10,900
you thought the mistake was that you

2946
02:16:08,210 --> 02:16:13,160
hadn't realized that heather was unhappy

2947
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:15,259
this evening in this discussion you said

2948
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:17,920
well maybe the ID made a mistake because

2949
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:22,640
they made the change to the our Sauk

2950
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:28,580
Constitution or membership I think those

2951
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:32,570
were in fact mistakes and I was but I

2952
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:35,599
you know I don't think your or the Ivy

2953
02:16:32,570 --> 02:16:37,520
is arguing and bad faith about the sense

2954
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:40,250
of the stewardship role for the RC

2955
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:42,920
series I've been on the ID and an

2956
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:45,200
ex-officio capacity in the past and I've

2957
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:47,840
always had that sense that the ID felt

2958
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:52,760
like our C series was part of the things

2959
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:57,260
that it was responsible for however I

2960
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:58,969
don't really sense I don't see that the

2961
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:02,179
ID is really acted like it was

2962
02:16:58,968 --> 02:17:04,189
responsible for the RC series right an

2963
02:17:02,179 --> 02:17:07,250
interruption in the RC series or a major

2964
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:08,420
disruption the RFC series you're

2965
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:09,950
responsible for that right you're

2966
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:12,020
responsible for the RC series now it's

2967
02:17:09,950 --> 02:17:13,250
being disrupted it's being disrupted

2968
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:16,400
because the RSC

2969
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:19,218
has told us that she had the impression

2970
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:22,699
that her customer wasn't happy with them

2971
02:17:19,218 --> 02:17:24,109
she sent that and I maybe you can

2972
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:26,450
confirm this but I believe that she sent

2973
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:31,280
that to you before it went to the larger

2974
02:17:26,450 --> 02:17:34,070
community so why didn't you find out why

2975
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:35,780
why didn't if you think that she

2976
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:37,730
misunderstood

2977
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:39,860
how the community felt about her

2978
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:42,500
performance why didn't you try to

2979
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:43,850
rectify that maybe you know if you

2980
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,719
weren't happy with it if you thought

2981
02:17:43,850 --> 02:17:46,250
there were no issues

2982
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:49,250
why didn't you convince her of that

2983
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:51,591
before her resignation went public if I

2984
02:17:49,250 --> 02:17:53,389
had a valued contractor one that was

2985
02:17:51,591 --> 02:17:56,091
critical to the operation of my company

2986
02:17:53,389 --> 02:17:59,809
and they said they were leaving I would

2987
02:17:56,091 --> 02:18:01,700
try to turn them around and so I see

2988
02:17:59,809 --> 02:18:07,100
that as a real failure of stewardship on

2989
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:09,650
the IBS part so - let me I have two

2990
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:14,059
suggestions - positive suggestions to

2991
02:18:09,650 --> 02:18:15,440
move forward I think that the are Sauk

2992
02:18:14,059 --> 02:18:17,900
members that were removed from the are

2993
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:20,360
Sauk should be added back in they bring

2994
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:23,719
expertise history for searching for an

2995
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:26,990
RSC they've done this before and I think

2996
02:18:23,719 --> 02:18:28,849
that the our sag and the ISC be bring a

2997
02:18:26,990 --> 02:18:31,219
lot of continuity and expertise in the

2998
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:33,050
RFC editors specifically going back to

2999
02:18:31,219 --> 02:18:34,279
when Bob Braden was our editor and I

3000
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:35,841
think you should take advantage of them

3001
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:45,890
even if they aren't on your picture

3002
02:18:35,841 --> 02:18:47,780
thank you hi this is finesse I was in

3003
02:18:45,889 --> 02:18:51,219
the IAB bun version two of this model

3004
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:54,440
was created then all that percent data

3005
02:18:51,219 --> 02:18:56,660
fairly nicely although still incomplete

3006
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:58,490
but it showed the complexity of all of

3007
02:18:56,660 --> 02:19:00,320
this and when it was written I had the

3008
02:18:58,490 --> 02:19:02,841
impression I was overly complicated for

3009
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:04,760
what we are doing in the idea we are

3010
02:19:02,841 --> 02:19:07,309
publishing technical specifications and

3011
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:12,770
this to me looks like Riley

3012
02:19:07,309 --> 02:19:14,510
as a sort of a publisher and I would

3013
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:16,280
encourage the idea to look into

3014
02:19:14,510 --> 02:19:18,620
simplifying that model because I think

3015
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:21,680
part of the problem is that so many

3016
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:23,000
parties involved for something that is

3017
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:26,921
not just not big enough

3018
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:31,671
we just over engineered this process

3019
02:19:26,921 --> 02:19:33,500
Suresh so first of all I'd like to put

3020
02:19:31,671 --> 02:19:35,360
foster stuff first like yeah Thank You

3021
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:36,800
Heather for your service and thank Sarah

3022
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:38,770
for the apology I think it really

3023
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:41,150
changed the tone of the conversation and

3024
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:43,881
one thing I want to say is like if we

3025
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:45,671
want to change what's 635 does we need

3026
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:48,559
to change it I think it's like pretty

3027
02:19:45,671 --> 02:19:49,570
tight to talk about right now I like to

3028
02:19:48,559 --> 02:19:51,551
say like okay we gonna

3029
02:19:49,570 --> 02:19:53,920
I think it's going to be a like

3030
02:19:51,551 --> 02:19:55,930
difficult call to make specifically like

3031
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,610
to what add-ons a drag for the

3032
02:19:55,931 --> 02:20:00,730
disruption of the RC series pretty much

3033
02:19:57,610 --> 02:20:02,891
so I think we should at least for this

3034
02:20:00,730 --> 02:20:04,869
like cycle continue with the are soft

3035
02:20:02,891 --> 02:20:07,181
like doing the selection and they'd be

3036
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:09,910
like approving it pretty much as said in

3037
02:20:07,181 --> 02:20:12,040
635 and one thing I want to say is like

3038
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:13,061
the data c++ bought I think one of the

3039
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:15,340
learnings is like you know if you need

3040
02:20:13,061 --> 02:20:17,080
to come connect to the community that we

3041
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:19,690
have that's like consuming the stuff and

3042
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:21,971
and a lot of the communities here ok

3043
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:24,910
like the IETF is here the IRT FS year

3044
02:20:21,971 --> 02:20:27,311
like IAB is here obviously but there's

3045
02:20:24,910 --> 02:20:29,619
also like other people outside like who

3046
02:20:27,311 --> 02:20:30,789
are not here and I think some of the

3047
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:33,311
stuff that came up was like you know

3048
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:34,660
we're not listening to them I think we

3049
02:20:33,311 --> 02:20:36,641
should make an effort to reach out to

3050
02:20:34,660 --> 02:20:39,610
the other people for implementing our

3051
02:20:36,641 --> 02:20:40,869
staff and using our staff to also find

3052
02:20:39,610 --> 02:20:42,250
out the needs I think like some of the

3053
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:44,590
stuff that Heather mentioned right like

3054
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:46,360
you know Dana and I kind of thing like

3055
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:49,360
those are like really something that we

3056
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:50,980
need and I think taking all these things

3057
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:55,471
into account I think it's like a really

3058
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:58,420
good idea going for jef raskin

3059
02:20:55,471 --> 02:21:02,020
on the topic of leaving the series

3060
02:20:58,420 --> 02:21:05,771
editor position empty for a period where

3061
02:21:02,021 --> 02:21:07,570
we're getting the new RFC format soon it

3062
02:21:05,771 --> 02:21:09,880
sounds like it's still going to be being

3063
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:13,601
debugged when we lose Heather at the end

3064
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:16,539
of the year and leaving leaving nobody

3065
02:21:13,601 --> 02:21:17,860
in charge while that that new format is

3066
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:19,721
still being debugged it makes me nervous

3067
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:22,351
now Heather and the and the other

3068
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:27,210
editors know best how to deal with that

3069
02:21:22,351 --> 02:21:27,210
but I wanted to raise that as I worry

3070
02:21:27,630 --> 02:21:34,089
thank you : so when I first heard about

3071
02:21:31,931 --> 02:21:35,980
this it started digging into it my first

3072
02:21:34,090 --> 02:21:37,480
reaction is wow something must have gone

3073
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:39,369
wrong here I want to figure out what it

3074
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:41,980
was and I went back trying to read all

3075
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:43,330
of ITF at ITF lists and that made me

3076
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:45,221
realize that we actually had a much

3077
02:21:43,330 --> 02:21:47,160
larger problem in this reading that list

3078
02:21:45,221 --> 02:21:50,770
and there was a reason I didn't read it

3079
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:51,910
but after I work on for a while I think

3080
02:21:50,771 --> 02:21:54,820
that when we've heard this from multiple

3081
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:58,660
people what we do going forward is this

3082
02:21:54,820 --> 02:22:00,580
by far more important here and I I worry

3083
02:21:58,660 --> 02:22:02,869
sometimes we have a very frustrating

3084
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:05,510
experience and then we make reaction

3085
02:22:02,869 --> 02:22:08,000
adjustments to it you know I caution us

3086
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:10,520
to proceed in a rational way that thinks

3087
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,529
about this stuff and sets up something

3088
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:14,029
that was in a reaction to a mistake or

3089
02:22:12,529 --> 02:22:16,550
something that happened but instead is a

3090
02:22:14,029 --> 02:22:18,800
better way of doing this

3091
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:20,420
I heard suggestions like that the

3092
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:21,979
three-year rotating term to keep

3093
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:23,210
continuity and those types of things and

3094
02:22:21,979 --> 02:22:25,278
that type sounds like a very logical

3095
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:27,589
type of thing I also think that we

3096
02:22:25,279 --> 02:22:29,689
should think that it's very normal for

3097
02:22:27,590 --> 02:22:31,670
any one of our groups that is is

3098
02:22:29,689 --> 02:22:33,649
responsible for contracts that are one

3099
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:36,050
of our most expensive budget items in

3100
02:22:33,649 --> 02:22:38,239
this organization of producing rfcs that

3101
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:39,739
that we would even if we thought that

3102
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:41,329
the contractor doing was doing a

3103
02:22:39,739 --> 02:22:42,920
wonderful job but we still would ask

3104
02:22:41,329 --> 02:22:44,539
about other prices for it periodically

3105
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:47,239
that had been normal oversight I would

3106
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:48,229
expect from any business group spending

3107
02:22:47,239 --> 02:22:50,149
a large chunk of money which you'd

3108
02:22:48,229 --> 02:22:51,289
occasionally check you know check that

3109
02:22:50,149 --> 02:22:53,269
it was you're getting the right thing

3110
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:54,949
the best things you could so I think

3111
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:57,649
that that's that's pretty normal

3112
02:22:54,949 --> 02:23:00,859
um I had a very hard time seeing a a

3113
02:22:57,649 --> 02:23:02,899
very specific problem with the process

3114
02:23:00,859 --> 02:23:05,569
with the the structure it seems like our

3115
02:23:02,899 --> 02:23:07,760
structure is in many ways similar to any

3116
02:23:05,569 --> 02:23:09,289
other structure we did invent but I do

3117
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:10,790
think we have to give more guidance on

3118
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:12,170
what we want out of it and sort of think

3119
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:13,369
of step back as community think about

3120
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:15,229
what are the things we can do to improve

3121
02:23:13,369 --> 02:23:20,149
that and then and then make those happen

3122
02:23:15,229 --> 02:23:22,698
over time Thanks okay Henrik you're next

3123
02:23:20,149 --> 02:23:24,019
I think the my clients have not drained

3124
02:23:22,699 --> 02:23:26,000
I'm not going to try and cut anybody off

3125
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:28,100
but at some point we may need to move

3126
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,310
everybody to the front of the room so

3127
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:33,770
that they can start resetting the back

3128
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:35,689
so if folks who are in the back if you

3129
02:23:33,770 --> 02:23:38,000
consider moving France to allow them to

3130
02:23:35,689 --> 02:23:40,729
do that that'd be good Henrik you you

3131
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:51,800
can start the thing by by coming to the

3132
02:23:40,729 --> 02:23:55,340
phone Thanks so yes I think something

3133
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:58,970
went wrong I think we need to look again

3134
02:23:55,340 --> 02:24:03,550
at the setup of the hora sock and the

3135
02:23:58,970 --> 02:24:09,948
process but I have one particular

3136
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:12,618
question for Ted I may be wrong but I

3137
02:24:09,949 --> 02:24:15,700
seem to recall that on the RFC those

3138
02:24:12,619 --> 02:24:20,170
plus both the Thun Thun

3139
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:24,190
you may be members and also were quite

3140
02:24:20,170 --> 02:24:28,450
vocal in proposing quite dramatic

3141
02:24:24,190 --> 02:24:31,120
changes did you consider that putting

3142
02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:35,141
them on the or sock might be a

3143
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:37,990
contributing action tune to conflict

3144
02:24:35,141 --> 02:24:39,670
within the or sock and something that

3145
02:24:37,990 --> 02:24:44,470
would spill over and make Heather

3146
02:24:39,670 --> 02:24:46,771
unhappy so I I think that we we sent a

3147
02:24:44,470 --> 02:24:49,570
message a year ago pretty much exactly

3148
02:24:46,771 --> 02:24:51,431
about the output of the art C++ both and

3149
02:24:49,570 --> 02:24:54,029
acknowledge that there were not just one

3150
02:24:51,431 --> 02:24:56,920
but I think I count seven mistakes in it

3151
02:24:54,030 --> 02:24:59,410
among them some of the early

3152
02:24:56,920 --> 02:25:01,540
consultation issues and it's clear that

3153
02:24:59,410 --> 02:25:04,300
there was an eighth mistake and that was

3154
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:06,700
at the at the end of that we were very

3155
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:09,279
clear that the community wanted Heather

3156
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:12,521
to take the lead in the further

3157
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:14,380
evolution discussions and not us and you

3158
02:25:12,521 --> 02:25:17,260
know we we thought that that was done

3159
02:25:14,380 --> 02:25:19,480
apparently it had continued to be a

3160
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:21,490
source of frustration for her enough

3161
02:25:19,480 --> 02:25:24,100
that when a later of frustration is this

3162
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:25,539
last straw on the camel's back it was

3163
02:25:24,101 --> 02:25:28,090
one of the things she cited in her

3164
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:29,500
message to the community as one of the

3165
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:32,050
issues that that had caused her to

3166
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:35,170
decide it was better for her to go away

3167
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:36,970
and that we were no longer aligned we

3168
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:38,620
didn't think that it was any more a

3169
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:42,520
question of alignment we thought we had

3170
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:45,700
aligned with the community on that and

3171
02:25:42,521 --> 02:25:48,130
it's clearly a mistake that that was not

3172
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:50,561
sufficiently communicated to either her

3173
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:53,350
or the community that that was no longer

3174
02:25:50,561 --> 02:25:55,960
something we were either advocating for

3175
02:25:53,351 --> 02:25:57,610
or expecting that answer your question

3176
02:25:55,960 --> 02:26:00,359
um not really

3177
02:25:57,610 --> 02:26:03,910
because I my question is about the

3178
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:06,340
potential for a built-in conflict or

3179
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:09,190
built-in tension in the or so as a

3180
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:13,030
result of putting two people who had in

3181
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:15,760
vocal in advocating quite big changes on

3182
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:18,580
there they were they were putting

3183
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:20,110
potentially not so so neither of the

3184
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:21,730
people who were put on the air sock were

3185
02:26:20,110 --> 02:26:25,210
proponents for the BOP and one of them

3186
02:26:21,730 --> 02:26:28,500
wasn't even on the idea that no I quite

3187
02:26:25,210 --> 02:26:32,039
clearly recall mark being very vocal

3188
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:35,100
in the opposite hospice am I wrong among

3189
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:36,149
these taken um I'd love to talk to you

3190
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:38,310
more about that because it's not my

3191
02:26:36,149 --> 02:26:44,910
recollection Oh my recollection is is

3192
02:26:38,310 --> 02:26:46,769
that I we should talk because that's

3193
02:26:44,910 --> 02:26:47,880
really not my recollection and I'd like

3194
02:26:46,770 --> 02:26:49,859
to understand where you get that there

3195
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:56,130
are some different perceptions there

3196
02:26:49,859 --> 02:26:58,890
I'll talk more okay thanks Leslie Daigle

3197
02:26:56,130 --> 02:27:00,720
so I have a question for you

3198
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:04,170
either you can or you representing the

3199
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:06,569
idea whatever then I want to give my

3200
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:09,210
answer and then answer your question

3201
02:27:06,569 --> 02:27:13,019
about filling the slot so the question

3202
02:27:09,210 --> 02:27:16,319
is on a continuum from the RFC plus

3203
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:18,960
bofto now I think we can agree we've

3204
02:27:16,319 --> 02:27:21,420
encountered some uncomfortable

3205
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:24,269
situations with the RFC editor and the

3206
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:29,520
artisan series what do you think's good

3207
02:27:24,270 --> 02:27:30,930
looks like but I'm sorry I don't really

3208
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,060
understand how I can answer that

3209
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:34,800
retrospectively I'm not asking you to

3210
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:37,319
answer it retrospectively I'm offering

3211
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:40,080
they the past year and the discomfort as

3212
02:27:37,319 --> 02:27:43,640
the problem has to be solved so given

3213
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:43,640
that what do you think good looks like

3214
02:27:44,390 --> 02:27:49,170
so I don't think we can get back to the

3215
02:27:47,189 --> 02:27:51,140
status quo ante given what's happened so

3216
02:27:49,170 --> 02:27:54,330
far so I think what good looks like

3217
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:56,278
starts by having the community come to

3218
02:27:54,330 --> 02:27:59,729
an agreement about whether they wants to

3219
02:27:56,279 --> 02:28:02,100
bring in an aura C to help the future

3220
02:27:59,729 --> 02:28:04,349
discussion now or as close to now as we

3221
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:06,930
can make it and with the acknowledgement

3222
02:28:04,350 --> 02:28:08,729
that John had brought up earlier of

3223
02:28:06,930 --> 02:28:11,040
needing to stretch beyond the

3224
02:28:08,729 --> 02:28:13,979
increasingly small number of people

3225
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:17,520
that's in this room and after that to

3226
02:28:13,979 --> 02:28:20,210
finish the community discussion of what

3227
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:22,649
changes need to happen here and I think

3228
02:28:20,210 --> 02:28:24,839
given some of the issues that Bob Hindon

3229
02:28:22,649 --> 02:28:27,210
raised those changes might in fact mean

3230
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:29,250
that it's no longer the IAB which

3231
02:28:27,210 --> 02:28:31,890
appoints the are sock at all but its

3232
02:28:29,250 --> 02:28:36,000
role changes quite significantly as a

3233
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:37,649
result of this I actually think that the

3234
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,010
right thing to happen is to make sure

3235
02:28:37,649 --> 02:28:43,029
that the community believes and has the

3236
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:44,620
structures in play

3237
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:48,101
to make sure that the function goes

3238
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:50,710
forward in the future whether the IAB

3239
02:28:48,101 --> 02:28:53,530
remains involved in that or not is not

3240
02:28:50,710 --> 02:28:55,180
nearly as important as making sure that

3241
02:28:53,530 --> 02:28:58,511
the community has confidence in those

3242
02:28:55,181 --> 02:29:01,061
structures okay thank you because I

3243
02:28:58,511 --> 02:29:04,540
think that was definitely responsive to

3244
02:29:01,061 --> 02:29:06,851
my question and my answer to the

3245
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:10,870
question aligns with much of it if not

3246
02:29:06,851 --> 02:29:13,811
all my answer is that a year from now I

3247
02:29:10,870 --> 02:29:16,690
would like the IETF and the internet

3248
02:29:13,811 --> 02:29:20,320
technical community as a whole which are

3249
02:29:16,690 --> 02:29:23,050
impacted by this situation to have

3250
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:26,471
confidence that we are all on the same

3251
02:29:23,050 --> 02:29:29,199
page about what the RSC is what the RFC

3252
02:29:26,471 --> 02:29:32,561
series is and that the people who are

3253
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:35,261
making the decisions not only agree with

3254
02:29:32,561 --> 02:29:37,750
what that is but are also empowered to

3255
02:29:35,261 --> 02:29:40,210
make it happen I think that from my

3256
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:44,920
perspective the RFC plus loft in some

3257
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:46,839
ways broke my confidence that I and the

3258
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:50,141
IAB actually had the same view of what

3259
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:52,511
the RSC series is and that confidence is

3260
02:29:50,141 --> 02:29:53,949
not yet restored I'm not sure that it's

3261
02:29:52,511 --> 02:29:58,061
going to be addressed by structural

3262
02:29:53,950 --> 02:30:01,000
issues but by way of getting to

3263
02:29:58,061 --> 02:30:05,949
competence as as the target again I want

3264
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:09,431
to reiterate that the fact that the that

3265
02:30:05,950 --> 02:30:12,400
we have lost the contractor for this

3266
02:30:09,431 --> 02:30:14,471
role at a time not of our choosing

3267
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:16,779
is actually a problem not just for the

3268
02:30:14,471 --> 02:30:19,061
IETF but for the broader internet

3269
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:22,210
technical community that this series is

3270
02:30:19,061 --> 02:30:23,949
meant to serve and I really like to feel

3271
02:30:22,210 --> 02:30:26,471
more confident that the IAB remembers

3272
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:28,511
that as we go forward and then finally

3273
02:30:26,471 --> 02:30:30,369
to your question of whether or not to

3274
02:30:28,511 --> 02:30:32,950
repopulated attempt to repopulate the

3275
02:30:30,370 --> 02:30:35,021
RSC position at this time the only thing

3276
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:37,511
I would say is if you elect not to do

3277
02:30:35,021 --> 02:30:39,761
that please put a hard time limit before

3278
02:30:37,511 --> 02:30:42,330
you will because if we just say when we

3279
02:30:39,761 --> 02:30:45,120
have consensus it might be a while

3280
02:30:42,330 --> 02:30:46,570
that's a very important point thank you

3281
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:50,351
Richard

3282
02:30:46,570 --> 02:30:53,190
yeah an observation with no value

3283
02:30:50,351 --> 02:30:55,900
assessed to it in terms of judgment

3284
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:59,110
you're the only one who's spoken

3285
02:30:55,900 --> 02:31:00,970
thank you so rich that was largely to

3286
02:30:59,110 --> 02:31:02,710
make sure that we were not all trying to

3287
02:31:00,970 --> 02:31:04,539
speak and therefore taking more time

3288
02:31:02,710 --> 02:31:08,640
with us talking than listening

3289
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:14,410
that's why thank you for the explanation

3290
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:16,770
okay hi Brian Dixon GoDaddy longtime

3291
02:31:14,410 --> 02:31:21,640
listener first-time caller

3292
02:31:16,771 --> 02:31:23,830
so looking at this with kind of shock on

3293
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:25,960
my face I'm apologized but I definitely

3294
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:29,680
want to extend my thanks is just an

3295
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:32,380
ordinary participant the way I would

3296
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:35,590
look at the RFC series editor position

3297
02:31:32,380 --> 02:31:40,089
would be potentially more akin to like a

3298
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:44,140
C Series speech type role and the our

3299
02:31:40,090 --> 02:31:46,990
Sauk role I would say better would align

3300
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:50,199
with like a board of directors and the

3301
02:31:46,990 --> 02:31:53,140
board of directors for a corporation has

3302
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:56,050
the best value when it has a lot of

3303
02:31:53,140 --> 02:31:59,289
stability and I don't know I don't know

3304
02:31:56,050 --> 02:32:03,009
what the rules are how the constituency

3305
02:31:59,290 --> 02:32:05,920
of the are sock is maintained where

3306
02:32:03,010 --> 02:32:09,280
they're drawn from etc etc but I think

3307
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:12,820
having a better dialogue with the RFC

3308
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:17,200
series editor on the constituency and

3309
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:22,561
the long-term direction and having much

3310
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:26,230
less change occur and having it be not

3311
02:32:22,561 --> 02:32:30,190
duration driven but more responsibility

3312
02:32:26,230 --> 02:32:32,800
or vision driven like it would be in any

3313
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:35,500
kind of bigger board type thing there's

3314
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:37,811
no reason not to that I can see and I

3315
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:41,351
would say that along with that as much

3316
02:32:37,811 --> 02:32:44,289
as the RFC series editor is a paid role

3317
02:32:41,351 --> 02:32:46,660
I do not think it should be viewed the

3318
02:32:44,290 --> 02:32:52,390
same as a contractor it should be viewed

3319
02:32:46,660 --> 02:32:54,700
as a limp semi limited role with the

3320
02:32:52,390 --> 02:32:57,490
expectation of as long as it's being

3321
02:32:54,700 --> 02:33:01,090
done well though it's up to the decision

3322
02:32:57,490 --> 02:33:03,699
of the are sock to replace or not but it

3323
02:33:01,090 --> 02:33:07,510
shouldn't be driven by particular

3324
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:08,340
scheduling or duration of contracts I

3325
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:09,820
think

3326
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:12,551
restructuring it

3327
02:33:09,820 --> 02:33:14,590
along those lines may have a better

3328
02:33:12,551 --> 02:33:16,900
result in terms of the people you'll

3329
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:19,931
attract and possibly even who you can

3330
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:21,789
retain so do you mean an employee

3331
02:33:19,931 --> 02:33:23,771
relationship is that which one yes I

3332
02:33:21,790 --> 02:33:26,740
mean look at it exactly the same as an

3333
02:33:23,771 --> 02:33:29,230
employee relationship for a CEO CEO

3334
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:32,380
reports to the board at the will of the

3335
02:33:29,230 --> 02:33:33,960
board but is expected to retain that

3336
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:37,180
role unless there's some mutual

3337
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:40,949
disagreement or reason to leave or you

3338
02:33:37,181 --> 02:33:40,950
know contractual just this disagreement

3339
02:33:41,551 --> 02:33:44,650
if I did get a quick response but please

3340
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:46,721
make it quick

3341
02:33:44,650 --> 02:33:48,789
sure very quickly I think that we've had

3342
02:33:46,721 --> 02:33:50,289
some discussion on the asset to list and

3343
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:52,210
during the discussion I expressed

3344
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:54,311
opposition to the idea of the earth RC

3345
02:33:52,210 --> 02:33:56,949
has an employee various reasons that are

3346
02:33:54,311 --> 02:33:57,940
on that list so I think there's the rest

3347
02:33:56,950 --> 02:34:06,130
of your comments I tell you agreement

3348
02:33:57,940 --> 02:34:08,910
but that part no for me medic comment

3349
02:34:06,130 --> 02:34:11,589
slash concern I think I see a there's

3350
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:13,150
kind of watching some of this dialogue

3351
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:15,370
and watching some of the conversations

3352
02:34:13,150 --> 02:34:17,320
in the ITF list looking at it as a

3353
02:34:15,370 --> 02:34:18,820
observer I see something I think echo

3354
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:21,910
alluded to this in one of his comments

3355
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:24,420
of the community trying to do on an

3356
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:26,619
incident review by plenary or

3357
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:28,360
micromanaging people we put it in a

3358
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:31,570
leadership role by plenary or trying to

3359
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:33,370
design by plenary and it's unclear how

3360
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:35,261
constructive that is I think at some

3361
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:37,830
point there we have a set of people that

3362
02:34:35,261 --> 02:34:41,440
we put in the leadership role and

3363
02:34:37,830 --> 02:34:43,150
they've and having been in those sorts

3364
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:45,730
of roles before trying to have the whole

3365
02:34:43,150 --> 02:34:47,109
community my crewmen second-guessing

3366
02:34:45,730 --> 02:34:49,210
decisions that were made that were

3367
02:34:47,110 --> 02:34:50,710
presumably made in good faith is not

3368
02:34:49,210 --> 02:34:53,051
really a healthy way to run the

3369
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:55,811
community and at some point we have to

3370
02:34:53,051 --> 02:34:58,840
assume that the people we in the IAB and

3371
02:34:55,811 --> 02:35:01,449
the our sakaar are acting in a good

3372
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:03,971
faith leadership role and are listening

3373
02:35:01,450 --> 02:35:05,561
to the inputs and and comments that

3374
02:35:03,971 --> 02:35:07,350
we're giving to them but trying to go

3375
02:35:05,561 --> 02:35:09,789
and have the entire community

3376
02:35:07,351 --> 02:35:12,280
micromanaging and trying to second-guess

3377
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:14,051
every single decision they are has a

3378
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:16,360
risk of creating an unhealthy

3379
02:35:14,051 --> 02:35:18,670
environment in an environment where

3380
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:19,870
NomCom was asking earlier like hey we

3381
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:22,660
have trouble getting people into

3382
02:35:19,870 --> 02:35:23,780
leadership roles the we should be asking

3383
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:25,610
ourselves you

3384
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:27,561
if people who are in those leadership

3385
02:35:25,610 --> 02:35:29,420
roles are feeling like every if they

3386
02:35:27,561 --> 02:35:32,330
make a mistake and then say sorry we

3387
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:34,311
made a mistake and start trying to um in

3388
02:35:32,330 --> 02:35:36,710
good faith look at what they did to make

3389
02:35:34,311 --> 02:35:37,820
that kind of made that mistake and try

3390
02:35:36,710 --> 02:35:40,430
to figure out how do they improve that

3391
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:42,050
going forwards if people feel like even

3392
02:35:40,431 --> 02:35:42,891
that they do that the entire community

3393
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:44,689
is going to be constantly

3394
02:35:42,891 --> 02:35:45,980
second-guessing them it's gonna be hard

3395
02:35:44,690 --> 02:35:47,360
to get people are gonna be interested in

3396
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:50,511
going into leadership roles dying for

3397
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:52,190
words so just to quickly respond to that

3398
02:35:50,511 --> 02:35:53,561
well I certainly hope that everybody

3399
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:55,820
believes we're acting in good faith

3400
02:35:53,561 --> 02:35:57,590
being in front of the plenary and

3401
02:35:55,820 --> 02:35:59,690
answering questions the community and

3402
02:35:57,590 --> 02:36:01,790
listening community is one of the

3403
02:35:59,690 --> 02:36:04,820
primary accountability mechanisms that

3404
02:36:01,790 --> 02:36:08,181
has been built into the IHF and I think

3405
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:10,160
that probably the worst possible result

3406
02:36:08,181 --> 02:36:13,730
of all of this would be losing it so I

3407
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:16,521
think as much as this is a difficult way

3408
02:36:13,730 --> 02:36:23,811
of getting things done we need to listen

3409
02:36:16,521 --> 02:36:26,181
and we need to listen in public hi I'm

3410
02:36:23,811 --> 02:36:29,660
Adrian Farrell I'm the independent

3411
02:36:26,181 --> 02:36:32,200
submissions editor some quick thanks

3412
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:34,431
thank to you and staying up there

3413
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:36,110
facilitating this and risking your blood

3414
02:36:34,431 --> 02:36:39,530
sugar levels

3415
02:36:36,110 --> 02:36:43,790
thanks to Ola for what turns out it

3416
02:36:39,530 --> 02:36:47,120
really helped for slide set along the

3417
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:50,660
way I will have mentioned the four

3418
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:52,360
screens that feed the RSC series and I

3419
02:36:50,660 --> 02:36:54,740
think Ted you introduced a term that

3420
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:57,230
hadn't come up from our life which was

3421
02:36:54,740 --> 02:37:00,440
the stream managers so that's the people

3422
02:36:57,230 --> 02:37:01,520
responsible in some inverted commas for

3423
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:04,820
the streams

3424
02:37:01,521 --> 02:37:06,650
I wondered along the way lots of

3425
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:09,380
decisions have been made by people on

3426
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:12,980
the platform at the moment and and

3427
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:15,619
elsewhere and in the future lots of

3428
02:37:12,980 --> 02:37:18,949
decisions event and need to be made as

3429
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:22,391
well what efforts were made and will be

3430
02:37:18,950 --> 02:37:26,150
made to consult the stream managers

3431
02:37:22,391 --> 02:37:27,619
about those decisions so I think that

3432
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:30,500
this is one of the structural changes we

3433
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:33,950
may have to make that the way that the

3434
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:35,900
system is currently set up the rock and

3435
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:37,600
the stream managers don't actually have

3436
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:39,609
a good interface other than

3437
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:41,949
just talking to each other and that it

3438
02:37:39,609 --> 02:37:44,560
may be necessary to institute a much

3439
02:37:41,949 --> 02:37:47,499
more structural relationship if if

3440
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:49,180
that's what we want to see yes I think

3441
02:37:47,499 --> 02:37:51,339
maybe if that's what we need because

3442
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:57,159
just talking to each other should work

3443
02:37:51,339 --> 02:37:59,079
just fine okay Brett Jordan some of the

3444
02:37:57,159 --> 02:38:01,419
comments tonight have referred to

3445
02:37:59,079 --> 02:38:03,579
Heather in the abstract and she's a

3446
02:38:01,419 --> 02:38:07,300
person and I think we need to realize

3447
02:38:03,579 --> 02:38:11,708
that we are losing Heather and I think

3448
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:14,378
that we should just like thank her for

3449
02:38:11,709 --> 02:38:16,180
her sacrifice in her service and more

3450
02:38:14,379 --> 02:38:19,449
care and feeding of your employees would

3451
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:21,159
be really good on your part well if we'd

3452
02:38:19,449 --> 02:38:38,829
like to do another standing ovation on

3453
02:38:21,159 --> 02:38:48,430
certainly willings you all have had the

3454
02:38:38,829 --> 02:38:53,619
capability of being very kind is that

3455
02:38:48,430 --> 02:38:54,850
negotiated oh yeah that was um but the

3456
02:38:53,619 --> 02:38:58,239
point he's made is something that I

3457
02:38:54,850 --> 02:39:00,129
would also like to touch on in Heather's

3458
02:38:58,239 --> 02:39:03,909
note and in the discussion here it's

3459
02:39:00,129 --> 02:39:06,100
clear that there was not enough open

3460
02:39:03,909 --> 02:39:09,399
communication and checking in on her and

3461
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:11,800
on the concerns that had been raised and

3462
02:39:09,399 --> 02:39:14,760
I would like to know what your plans are

3463
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:17,890
for checking in on all of the other

3464
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:20,260
incredibly critical contractors and

3465
02:39:17,890 --> 02:39:27,970
volunteers and making sure that they are

3466
02:39:20,260 --> 02:39:31,390
not in similar states so that's a really

3467
02:39:27,970 --> 02:39:35,698
good question we do have some methods of

3468
02:39:31,390 --> 02:39:37,749
working with am most folks in less than

3469
02:39:35,699 --> 02:39:39,819
formal structures and I think those are

3470
02:39:37,749 --> 02:39:41,499
avenues where we could might potentially

3471
02:39:39,819 --> 02:39:42,760
learn of that but it's probably

3472
02:39:41,499 --> 02:39:45,489
something that we need to work with the

3473
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:47,169
LLC board on since the IAB actually

3474
02:39:45,489 --> 02:39:48,609
doesn't have formal relationships with

3475
02:39:47,169 --> 02:39:50,109
many of those other contractors but

3476
02:39:48,609 --> 02:39:51,341
thanks for raising the issue not just

3477
02:39:50,109 --> 02:39:54,521
contractors

3478
02:39:51,341 --> 02:39:56,830
tears and also their people we talk to

3479
02:39:54,521 --> 02:39:59,471
each other a build a team I mean it's

3480
02:39:56,830 --> 02:40:01,541
the formal and the informal and that's

3481
02:39:59,471 --> 02:40:04,240
what I'm hearing was missing thank you

3482
02:40:01,541 --> 02:40:05,471
very much okay Richard I know you've

3483
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:07,240
been up at the thing before please make

3484
02:40:05,471 --> 02:40:09,011
it as short because we've got a short

3485
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:10,480
amount of time left I'm seeing Alexis

3486
02:40:09,011 --> 02:40:11,620
showing up looking threatening I'm happy

3487
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:14,801
to yield to John because I think he was

3488
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:16,721
up before me I've also been here before

3489
02:40:14,801 --> 02:40:18,400
this will be very brief but I've heard

3490
02:40:16,721 --> 02:40:20,561
it something a couple of times tonight a

3491
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:23,859
couple of times of the list which needs

3492
02:40:20,561 --> 02:40:26,940
clarification if I decide to go down to

3493
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:30,521
the local hardware store and buy a

3494
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:34,120
kilogram of Tenpenny Canadian standard

3495
02:40:30,521 --> 02:40:35,711
nails because they are Canadian standard

3496
02:40:34,120 --> 02:40:38,381
there is a Canadian standard for

3497
02:40:35,711 --> 02:40:40,840
Tenpenny nails at a Canadian standard

3498
02:40:38,381 --> 02:40:42,251
four kilogram I know what I'm getting

3499
02:40:40,841 --> 02:40:44,141
and if I decide to go to the next

3500
02:40:42,251 --> 02:40:47,101
hardware store and do price comparisons

3501
02:40:44,141 --> 02:40:51,391
I can do that in a reliable way

3502
02:40:47,101 --> 02:40:55,690
if we start talking about bidding these

3503
02:40:51,391 --> 02:40:58,961
contracts on a competitive price basis

3504
02:40:55,690 --> 02:41:01,330
we are in deep deep trouble because we

3505
02:40:58,961 --> 02:41:03,910
are insulting the people whom we would

3506
02:41:01,330 --> 02:41:06,190
most want to do the jobs and we are

3507
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:09,641
going to get ourselves exactly what we

3508
02:41:06,190 --> 02:41:12,221
deserve so let's be very very careful

3509
02:41:09,641 --> 02:41:13,811
about a vocabulary which starts talking

3510
02:41:12,221 --> 02:41:17,859
about we competing these things

3511
02:41:13,811 --> 02:41:19,721
periodically to get a better price thank

3512
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:21,791
you I think that the point was made on

3513
02:41:19,721 --> 02:41:23,740
the list that in the past these have

3514
02:41:21,791 --> 02:41:26,230
never been actually evaluated on price

3515
02:41:23,740 --> 02:41:27,431
and I think it's unlikely that we would

3516
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:29,740
ever go to that point Richard you're

3517
02:41:27,431 --> 02:41:31,001
next yeah I just like to briefly revisit

3518
02:41:29,740 --> 02:41:32,320
a point that some points that are made

3519
02:41:31,001 --> 02:41:34,631
earlier about the composition of the air

3520
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:36,730
so I can say perhaps surprisingly I have

3521
02:41:34,631 --> 02:41:37,900
a little more positive view than was the

3522
02:41:36,730 --> 02:41:40,180
news van Express here I think the

3523
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:42,400
current hawk has a good blend of

3524
02:41:40,181 --> 02:41:43,841
experience and new thinking few folks

3525
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:45,910
representing different aspects of the

3526
02:41:43,841 --> 02:41:47,171
community so I'm actually quite pleased

3527
02:41:45,910 --> 02:41:48,761
with the current harness on I feel like

3528
02:41:47,171 --> 02:41:50,830
they've been as I said earlier doing it

3529
02:41:48,761 --> 02:41:52,601
a pretty good job oversight I'm also

3530
02:41:50,830 --> 02:41:54,851
deeply uncomfortable with another notion

3531
02:41:52,601 --> 02:41:57,221
that was raised here of consulting the

3532
02:41:54,851 --> 02:41:58,931
broader Internet community as Christiane

3533
02:41:57,221 --> 02:42:00,939
pointed out on the lists like there's

3534
02:41:58,931 --> 02:42:02,561
it's really hard to get to do the whole

3535
02:42:00,940 --> 02:42:04,181
internet your honor that's really big

3536
02:42:02,561 --> 02:42:05,440
and you know

3537
02:42:04,181 --> 02:42:06,700
as we're seeing here if you look around

3538
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:09,161
the room we're having trouble getting

3539
02:42:06,700 --> 02:42:19,631
the committed IETF community to show up

3540
02:42:09,161 --> 02:42:21,461
for these discussions so can you repeat

3541
02:42:19,631 --> 02:42:28,811
what she said because nobody ever could

3542
02:42:21,461 --> 02:42:30,641
hear I said it still represents the

3543
02:42:28,811 --> 02:42:32,501
entire technical community whether or

3544
02:42:30,641 --> 02:42:34,331
not you can consult it it's part of the

3545
02:42:32,501 --> 02:42:36,371
RFC series we actually don't get to

3546
02:42:34,331 --> 02:42:38,561
redefine that but I mean at some point

3547
02:42:36,371 --> 02:42:40,301
we need to represent people a concrete

3548
02:42:38,561 --> 02:42:42,671
group of people and the needs of the

3549
02:42:40,301 --> 02:42:44,471
concrete folks who are showing up in the

3550
02:42:42,671 --> 02:42:46,780
room and doing work and producing these

3551
02:42:44,471 --> 02:42:49,121
things and the people who are using who

3552
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:52,570
are you and the community who are using

3553
02:42:49,121 --> 02:42:54,490
them to get over it we're listening at

3554
02:42:52,570 --> 02:42:56,110
this point he stated his opinion we can

3555
02:42:54,490 --> 02:42:58,360
move on

3556
02:42:56,110 --> 02:42:59,950
Henrick I think we have to go ahead and

3557
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:01,511
say we're done taking new people in

3558
02:42:59,950 --> 02:43:05,530
because we're now seriously over time

3559
02:43:01,511 --> 02:43:06,761
like over our over time so I'm gonna

3560
02:43:05,530 --> 02:43:08,581
drain the queue on this side since it

3561
02:43:06,761 --> 02:43:12,881
was already occupied

3562
02:43:08,581 --> 02:43:15,661
iliyan Thank You Ted Thank You ivy for

3563
02:43:12,881 --> 02:43:18,760
staying late and I'd like to also thank

3564
02:43:15,661 --> 02:43:20,381
colleagues here I think generally that

3565
02:43:18,761 --> 02:43:23,351
we've had a pretty positive discussion

3566
02:43:20,381 --> 02:43:27,161
here and I think we should all recognize

3567
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:30,131
that I understand I can see that there's

3568
02:43:27,161 --> 02:43:31,751
still a lot of passion that people have

3569
02:43:30,131 --> 02:43:35,711
and there are ideas that they haven't

3570
02:43:31,751 --> 02:43:37,541
had the opportunity to express one of

3571
02:43:35,711 --> 02:43:39,820
the things I think the most important

3572
02:43:37,541 --> 02:43:41,891
question I have is where do we go from

3573
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:43,360
here in terms of how do you want to

3574
02:43:41,891 --> 02:43:45,971
structure the conversation going forward

3575
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:48,311
Ted okay I think that the short answer

3576
02:43:45,971 --> 02:43:49,751
is we're probably going to make a very

3577
02:43:48,311 --> 02:43:50,891
quick decision about whether this needs

3578
02:43:49,751 --> 02:43:54,341
a new mailing list or whether we'll

3579
02:43:50,891 --> 02:43:57,600
reuse our Etsy interest after that

3580
02:43:54,341 --> 02:44:01,450
decision we'll write off a short

3581
02:43:57,601 --> 02:44:03,851
reflection on this meeting and post it

3582
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:07,511
to the ITF Part C interest and if there

3583
02:44:03,851 --> 02:44:09,581
is a new list to that list and put put

3584
02:44:07,511 --> 02:44:12,761
out the the rest of the discussion from

3585
02:44:09,581 --> 02:44:15,070
that point I have a strong belief at

3586
02:44:12,761 --> 02:44:17,581
this point that one of the key risks

3587
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:20,251
that Heather articulated

3588
02:44:17,581 --> 02:44:22,051
is that if the ball gets dropped during

3589
02:44:20,251 --> 02:44:25,831
this period of transition in the format

3590
02:44:22,051 --> 02:44:27,541
there may be a set of issues that makes

3591
02:44:25,831 --> 02:44:30,301
it even more difficult to bring somebody

3592
02:44:27,541 --> 02:44:34,291
in afterwards as a result of that I

3593
02:44:30,301 --> 02:44:35,311
think the most likely result here even

3594
02:44:34,291 --> 02:44:37,859
though there were very clear

3595
02:44:35,311 --> 02:44:41,280
articulations for why we might want to

3596
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:43,980
wait until further community discussion

3597
02:44:41,281 --> 02:44:46,291
occurred that we will probably say that

3598
02:44:43,980 --> 02:44:48,689
having the ability to overlap with

3599
02:44:46,291 --> 02:44:53,520
Heather is probably an overriding

3600
02:44:48,690 --> 02:44:55,471
concern but that's the the reflection

3601
02:44:53,521 --> 02:45:01,021
that will go to the lists for further

3602
02:44:55,471 --> 02:45:03,811
discussion Sarah you're gonna have the

3603
02:45:01,021 --> 02:45:07,860
funnel I'll be incredibly quick two

3604
02:45:03,811 --> 02:45:09,451
points yes generally in our technical

3605
02:45:07,860 --> 02:45:11,311
designs we try to avoid single points of

3606
02:45:09,451 --> 02:45:12,811
failure I would encourage people to

3607
02:45:11,311 --> 02:45:15,721
think about that as we go forward in

3608
02:45:12,811 --> 02:45:17,491
terms of structure second the primary

3609
02:45:15,721 --> 02:45:18,991
purpose is Hana said of this

3610
02:45:17,491 --> 02:45:21,211
organization is to publish technical

3611
02:45:18,991 --> 02:45:22,801
specifications and whatever structure we

3612
02:45:21,211 --> 02:45:24,270
choose has to serve that ultimately

3613
02:45:22,801 --> 02:45:26,400
thank you thank you

3614
02:45:24,271 --> 02:45:28,741
and let me add at the final moment to

3615
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:30,241
thank you to all of you who came to this

3616
02:45:28,741 --> 02:45:33,451
part of the plenary and gave your

3617
02:45:30,241 --> 02:45:35,400
thoughts to each other and the IAB and

3618
02:45:33,451 --> 02:45:36,750
the I saw on this set of points I

3619
02:45:35,400 --> 02:45:39,780
realize it's been a very emotional

3620
02:45:36,751 --> 02:45:41,400
couple of weeks for many and I also

3621
02:45:39,781 --> 02:45:44,881
appreciate the collegial and

3622
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:46,920
professional manner you all participated

3623
02:45:44,881 --> 02:45:53,079
in thank you very much

3624
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:53,079
[Applause]

3625
02:46:26,810 --> 02:46:28,868
you
