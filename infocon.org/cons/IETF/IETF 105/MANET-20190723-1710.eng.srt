1
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,489
while we're thinking about all this and

2
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,559
still not quite time to get started yet

3
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,530
we're gonna mean well it is it's right

4
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:54,608
on time we're gonna need note takers and

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:58,109
jabber scribes so who would like to to

6
00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:00,879
volunteer we only have a small group to

7
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,339
to choose from huh

8
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,959
I didn't either and that's why I'm

9
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:09,730
having trouble downloading these or

10
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:19,720
uploading these slide sets okay

11
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:22,120
Oh anybody wanted to jabber I can give

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,480
you my iPad I think even though you work

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,480
on that

14
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:37,539
[Music]

15
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:39,689
I know yeah I'll start to pull you

16
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,689
through

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:51,250
I'll start completion okay well welcome

18
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:54,520
to men a will probably walk through this

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,229
slowly first things first I apologize

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,429
I'm staying right left by the way one of

21
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:05,039
the one of the chairs of men a my

22
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:08,739
co-chair is not here this time around I

23
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:16,630
apologize I do not have an agenda slide

24
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:20,260
in the note wealth that's my error it

25
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,819
got caught up in other things like me

26
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,739
trying to get here on airplanes and they

27
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:30,310
kind of weird stuff so I apologize for

28
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:34,030
that but we do have a note-taker we do

29
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,859
have a jabber scribe identified and we

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,590
didn't really have an agenda until a

31
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:43,569
couple of days ago when Lou mentioned

32
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,940
some discussion around deal app and

33
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,708
multicast deal up support for multicast

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,660
which i think is a really good thing for

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:56,709
us to talk about and then Ronald has

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,250
some slides and that's great the more

37
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:04,989
the merrier

38
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:06,670
I see our ad is not yet here so I don't

39
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,489
know what is the protocol should we

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:15,328
proceed with our 1819 years should we

41
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:18,280
hold okay okay we should proceed I

42
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:23,769
wanted to note with document status

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,370
first that the multi hoc forwarding

44
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:33,209
extension has now been published as RFC

45
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,209
86 29 congratulations to the authors

46
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:41,950
that leaves us with just a handful of

47
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,760
documents they're currently

48
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:54,660
active in the group and most of them are

49
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:58,599
in last calls or in iesg evaluations

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,780
specifically the latency extension is n

51
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:09,459
is G the lid extension is waiting for a

52
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:11,890
an updated ID and the pause extension is

53
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:21,130
actually in the editor queue so it will

54
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:24,700
be coming out shortly as far as the

55
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:27,940
other three documents go the flow

56
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,780
control the diff server where credit

57
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:38,200
windows in the traffic classification

58
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:39,929
stuff they've been in in last call for

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,130
quite some time I think it's time to

60
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:49,180
close out the last call and advance them

61
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,310
towards publication but I'll do that on

62
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,490
the mailing list

63
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,850
I'll asked for one more one more round

64
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,419
of potential comments and then based on

65
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:04,800
that we will close out those last calls

66
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,799
and start trying to push him forward

67
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,210
Rick take a quick question I know with

68
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,700
the credit windowing and the the credit

69
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,479
extension stuff there was some debate

70
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,550
about the authorship because there was

71
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,840
the original drafts about credit

72
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,430
windowing that were part of deal app

73
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,039
then got removed from deal app and the

74
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,330
diff server where credit when doing sort

75
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,710
of brought the ideas back is that all

76
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,900
being resolved because I thought there

77
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,849
was some question that will got fixed I

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:37,810
found it Han cool just checking yeah

79
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:40,479
yeah yeah everyone's noting so yeah at

80
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:46,180
least as as far as I know it was it was

81
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,639
indeed resolved ok so that's where we're

82
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,039
at on the document status the other

83
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,960
thing that I again I profusely

84
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,770
apologized for I don't have slide set

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,590
for is the note well the please

86
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,139
note that this meeting is covered by AI

87
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,650
ETFs note well so take that into

88
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:07,639
consideration as you make comments at

89
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:12,460
the mic or comments over jabber than it

90
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:18,289
is this is covered by the denote well

91
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:19,789
and I having said that I think once

92
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:38,900

[Music]

00:07:41,870 --> 00:08:01,010
yeah some slides not slides I hereby I

102
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:03,510
hereby disapprove of the discussion I

103
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:16,550
hereby disapprove of your slides that I

104
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:16,550
really wanted to see come on to be left

105
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,810
making this harder than it has to be but

106
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:40,829
that's me

107
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:44,010
usually what I do that was my bad okay

108
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:49,410
so I will hand the floor over Oh our ad

109
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:52,670
is now present mr. Alvaro Ratana so I

110
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:56,010
will turn the floor over to mr. Berger

111
00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:01,140
hi I'm Lou Berger this is based on a

112
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:03,000
discussion that we it started with some

113
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,050
offline discussions with Dave Wiggins

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,150
who as an open source implementation

115
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,939
next slide please

116
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:17,209
who has an open source implementation

117
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:26,250
published up on github and now back one

118
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:29,820
yeah he went to okay well anyway this is

119
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:35,130
based on some implementation questions

120
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:39,540
and experience and it started with the

121
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,870
discussions with Dave Wiggins who

122
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,560
hopefully is online by the way no we

123
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:50,130
don't I was hoping he would jump in and

124
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,479
then we came up with some answers

125
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,180
I felt a little more comfortable with

126
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,699
them and then David did and at but I

127
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:02,670
said since I've I'm the one who shows up

128
00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:06,029
here that I would ask the RFC 81-75

129
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,459
authors what they thought but we also

130
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:10,949
didn't want to bias the answer so we

131
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:13,018
didn't give our answers the cool thing

132
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:15,630
is we came up they came up with exactly

133
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,730
the same answers that we came up with so

134
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,220
that was really nice if it was different

135
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:25,350
would have been okay too

136
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,800
I do think David had the point that if

137
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,290
you do a strict reading of the document

138
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,219
it doesn't support necessarily

139
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,959
everything that we have here and so some

140
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,259
he thinks it's important to get the

141
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:45,750
clarification I think the first two

142
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:47,970
questions are they're not 100% clear but

143
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,459
I think the intent is there so I think

144
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,519
we could do that with an errata the last

145
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,258
one is definitely not clear I don't I

146
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,660
think is beyond the intent of the

147
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:01,050
document but it also turns out not to

148
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,930
take any change in the protocol formats

149
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:07,560
to support it but since really is it's

150
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,870
going beyond the intent I think a small

151
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,670
document that doesn't update is the

152
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,949
right answer and since we're going to be

153
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,389
there rather than do a and B in errata I

154
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:24,290
might as well just do the whole thing in

155
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:29,490
a small document to Kiev errata in RFC

156
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:31,800
81-75 someone his name eludes me pointed

157
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,889
out that there is another inconsistency

158
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,859
in 81-75 there are two sections which

159
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:40,889
contradict each other I suggested he

160
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,420
raised an errata he never did to be

161
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,779
honest I'd spotted that as well

162
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,170
post-publication so there is at least

163
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:52,110
one other potential well it is an errata

164
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,360
I'll raise it I see I see a co-author

165
00:11:52,110 --> 00:12:00,389
joining a potential document here and

166
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:02,670
yes you don't turn around so you know

167
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:06,450
the the if we're gonna throw it together

168
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:08,760
document that gives clarifications to

169
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,550
the document as well as how to cover all

170
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,000
of these cases might as well do that in

171
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,280
one so a lot of a fourth one there so

172
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,220
this is really the overview slide now

173
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,280
there's a bunch of detail the next slide

174
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,220
actually everything in the micro font

175
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,540
the act is italicized is excerpts from

176
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:34,080
the RFC so it's just taken from 81-75

177
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,230
and the there are a couple of things

178
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,030
that I think are really interesting here

179
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,130
there is there are some behaviors that

180
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,569
are pretty clearly defined so that's

181
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,590
great so that's the easy part but

182
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:51,230
there's some things that you have to go

183
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:54,260
and interpret like for instance that

184
00:12:51,230 --> 00:13:00,240
where do you carry a multicast address

185
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:02,670
well it does say it's a logical

186
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,130
destination and so it should can be

187
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:10,079
treated as a destination generally that

188
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:13,040
means a Mac and Mac end point a Mac dead

189
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,410
station well what about the IP addresses

190
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,699
the IP addresses are carried in the ipv4

191
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:23,219
and ipv6 yeah but we know B's so where

192
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,190
do you carry the IP multicast addresses

193
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,370
is that explicit it's not it's okay

194
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:32,280
yes I can't agree you can infer but it's

195
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,380
not stated yes a Rick Taylor again it's

196
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,020
important and this is why the deal at

197
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,300
the lead draft exists is that

198
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:42,270
fundamentally didn't RFC 81-75 deal it

199
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,930
talks about a destination is defined by

200
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:48,449
its lair to MAC address so yeah you can

201
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,000
have traditional broadcast Macs and you

202
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,710
can use and like it eludes me what

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,660
specification it is the encoding of

204
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,740
multicast addresses with the multicast

205
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:02,040
Mac oh you I yeah and so but it is

206
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,830
specifically Mac not generally it is

207
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,839
absolute right but is there an

208
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,640
expectation that a multi-cat the real

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,830
multicast IP address is going to be

210
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,790
carried in any of our any of the

211
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,680
messages I think it's a missus should I

212
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,410
think it's not specified

213
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,239
I think it's imply you think Averroes

214
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,240
telling me I'm wrong and I believe it

215
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:32,970
okay so I think it's clean this case the

216
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,010
intent is can be read but you know

217
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,290
sometimes like in a specification it's

218
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,540
it's good to be explicit

219
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,449
so I think I think I think that part

220
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,670
actually would qualify as an errata as

221
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,990
we really meant this and you can read it

222
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,089
that way and it would be good if you

223
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,500
just add the word multicast I don't

224
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:51,690
think there's a that I don't think it's

225
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,520
a major change and that's certainly how

226
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,710
the implementation that's that we're

227
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,290
referring to expects it to be used this

228
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,210
multicast even David who had the issue

229
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,310
saying things are a little not as best

230
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,910
as specific as they should be what

231
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,380
didn't have that issue

232
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,180
so I'm not sure exactly you said a lot

233
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,510
of words that could be another brother

234
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,150
yes the way a senior brother is you

235
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,140
forgot a word or the word is misspelled

236
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:20,880
or you know instead of saying or

237
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,360
multicast such a bit and multicast or

238
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,610
you know whatever the explanation that

239
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,089
seems to be given seems to me that it

240
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,710
wouldn't fit well maybe I shouldn't harp

241
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,750
on the Arado or not because at the end

242
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,230
result is because we have problems ABC

243
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,660
and now we heard D and problem C yeah so

244
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,960
prop well C C is definitely not an

245
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,170
errata we're gonna have to do something

246
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,630
anyway so I should stop my proposal in

247
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,319
the end when I get there is I was trying

248
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,689
to work up to it

249
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,780
so I should just skip there is that we

250
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,730
do a small document that clarifies all

251
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,010
these points and one and it's one

252
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,170
document I wouldn't do it as abyss I

253
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,700
don't think it's enough of a whole

254
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,290
revision of the protocol I don't think

255
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,300
we have enough experience to do that yet

256
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,689
I would do it as a small document that's

257
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,910
lists that as an update to 81-75 yeah

258
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,520
this is staying around if I will also

259
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,650
say on this first one I you can't do it

260
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,339
in an errata with a word but you can do

261
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,650
it with about one sentence which is I'm

262
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,280
the multicast addresses must be carried

263
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,930
with the following POVs either way we're

264
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,130
we're gonna end up in the same point is

265
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,880
we're gonna have this other document so

266
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,790
I don't think we

267
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,140
to spend a lot of time on it and you

268
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,939
know having if we're gonna have that

269
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,439
document might as well put everything in

270
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,140
there to clarify the whole situation

271
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,820
because then people don't have to notice

272
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,590
how many places they go look they just

273
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,680
look at one additional place and we do

274
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,720
an update so it updates so that any 175

275
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,579
Cisco will read here if you're going to

276
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,320
implement it and you're done and it's

277
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:58,320
one document so point number two by the

278
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,880
way is would be I don't know an errata

279
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,610
or not sorry I guess I shouldn't say

280
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:06,720
that again the point number two is

281
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,490
really fun so it says a modem needs to

282
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,000
expect multicast addresses are in a

283
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,609
destination up request guess what there

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,410
isn't a destination up request right

285
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:21,719
it's an announced so I do have a comment

286
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,630
later that says oh we interpret this to

287
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,160
mean be announced and that was like some

288
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,050
name change that just didn't get cleaned

289
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,120
up I'll point out that this is an

290
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,100
informational text so it's not really

291
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,800
that but it's not a problematic except

292
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:38,189
you have to infer a little bit of what

293
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,320
goes on just as a sort of point of

294
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,690
historical interest for people the the

295
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,010
destination announced came in very late

296
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,140
in the drafting of delay and previously

297
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,000
ups could go both ways and it got really

298
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,590
confusing so we renamed and obviously

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,840
this got missed in the search and

300
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,149
replace yeah you'll have to blame your

301
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,300
review you have to blame your reviewer

302
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,070
for not catching it this is how I ended

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:09,149
how I ended up at D luck by the way I

304
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:10,620
was reviewing this stuff yeah I think I

305
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,520
think this is an enough on the

306
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:19,260
background next so from the three

307
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,030
questions we have the stands answer or

308
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,300
cut and paste from some private email by

309
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,010
the way with permission and then the

310
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:31,010
results of the offline discussions

311
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:32,910
including with Stan Rick and David so

312
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,140
you know there's there's the question

313
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:41,220
here's the text but really what it comes

314
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:44,020
down to is how does a receiver identify

315
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,410
itself and this is the the classic thing

316
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,200
of IGMP joins and leaves how do you do

317
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:54,510
that simple thing it's really important

318
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,580
that we support that what do we do and I

319
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:01,090
think we we all have came up with the

320
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,889
same conclusion by the way the

321
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,399
implementation has a little issue here

322
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,500
of once you've done I'm trying to

323
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,300
remember the exact issue but it was like

324
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,920
once he had done a message in one

325
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,190
direction it wasn't expecting it in the

326
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,600
other and rejected it and so if you I'm

327
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,970
looking at Rick because I know he's

328
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,530
using this code so you've probably hit

329
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,540
this code and maybe even have a pull

330
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:28,570
request to fix it all right so anyway

331
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:31,389
how do we do joins that's the most basic

332
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,210
thing destination analysis is what

333
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,670
everyone agrees on we read that that was

334
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,610
the intent of the document that the

335
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,050
multicast Mac is the Mac based on the

336
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,580
RFC you were just talking about that I

337
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,530
neither of us remember the name but in

338
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,389
the number excuse me that says if you

339
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,490
have an IP multicast address how you map

340
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:51,130
it into a multicast MAC address so

341
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,080
that's that MAC address we do believe

342
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,380
you want to have a multicast address

343
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,970
list because there's a code there's the

344
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,610
way that mapping works you see you can

345
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,700
have multiple monthly IP multicast

346
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,399
addresses map into the singleton so we

347
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,510
think that's a list and by the way when

348
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,060
you update the list I put the comment on

349
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:16,600
other slides I've missed it on this one

350
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:20,889
this is a list that is a complete list

351
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,250
of all the groups so let's say you had

352
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:27,880
group a and B that map to the same MAC

353
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,160
address and you join with a and you now

354
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,840
want to add B you would have to send an

355
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:37,690
announced with a and B now let's say you

356
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,730
want to remove a you have to send it

357
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,710
announce with just B so it's sort of

358
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,010
like these old soft state protocols and

359
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,750
that you had well and I JPS off this

360
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:50,970
state so you know sort of makes sense

361
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:55,630
but so that's that's the full list and

362
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,930
the router will send it's complete

363
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:06,950
understanding

364
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:08,960
the modem has to infer the Delta Stu

365
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,070
card critical technologies if you're

366
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,010
actually going to put some of those

367
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:17,210
words in there as clarifications they

368
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,490
may end up being a first case up okay

369
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,100
thank you

370
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:24,290
because semantically that's a joint

371
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,139
slash leave the destination announced

372
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:29,510
and the destination down is not a leave

373
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,280
it's a leave all right so we went right

374
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,200
and in fact I have that on the slide and

375
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,430
for some reason I have it on the next

376
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,220
slide but not on this slide it's really

377
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:40,280
annoying I don't know I didn't do that

378
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,380
Rick Taylor again um I don't know

379
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,190
because I haven't got Dean up in front

380
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,840
of me at the moment

381
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,060
if you sent an announced with a

382
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,760
multicast Mac and a single multicast IP

383
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,669
address and then sent another announced

384
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,840
with the same multicast Mac and a

385
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:58,550
different multicast single address

386
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,949
whether the modem should assume that is

387
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:04,040
just an addition because you haven't

388
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,380
retracted the previous idea how do you

389
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,170
attract any retract exactly apart from

390
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,540
as you Stooges said the down is a

391
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:15,290
retract all right because there's a

392
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:18,620
remove indicator on the IP address yes

393
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:22,550
there is so oh you're right yes it's all

394
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,350
wrong you so this is why we have to

395
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,639
write it down no no I think you're I

396
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,530
think I'm wrong I think we're heading

397
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,210
rapidly towards a multicast

398
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,480
considerations for delayed documents

399
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,520
which yeah it was so so this is great

400
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,930
you know I did the slides quickly and

401
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,190
obviously I blew that so I mean it

402
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,650
doesn't change the slide to change the

403
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,310
narrative sorry blue my narrative slides

404
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:54,080
perfect just like just like the RFC

405
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:55,760
right anyway so yeah so that's the nice

406
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,350
thing about writing a new document is

407
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,790
we're gonna be very methodical about it

408
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,439
and make sure we get it right and make

409
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,450
sure all the details are there so this

410
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,070
is highlighting that we need that I

411
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,080
think you're right that there is the

412
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:09,159
drop already in there and that that's

413
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,159
the right way to solve this problem

414
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,490
Rick again just continuing but it's not

415
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,820
I don't believe it's explicitly called

416
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,830
out and at an announced at followed by

417
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,750
an announced ads with the different IP

418
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,510
address on the same match I don't think

419
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,340
that behavior is clarifying oh III in

420
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,020
fact I would think that what you would

421
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,629
do is send one message that adds and

422
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,400
drops yeah but what happens if I've got

423
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,690
one multicast address on what I want to

424
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,030
be I'm interested in because I'm the

425
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,550
Rooter and then this is receive this is

426
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,440
receiver this is this is the receiver

427
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,710
sorry yes so the motive received

428
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,930
something so I'm I'm a router yes so the

429
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,930
road throughs I joined someone upstream

430
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:54,660
downstream downstream of me has joined

431
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:56,730
yeah I want to join right I am

432
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:01,050
interested in I'm a listener I'm a

433
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:02,640
listener for this so you request

434
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,620
information through the announce message

435
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,000
for this first like the address it's

436
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:10,649
here I mean you're doing a listen you're

437
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,500
doing a join or less and that's another

438
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,390
request comes in for a second IP addres

439
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,780
happens to collide that happens to

440
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:21,000
collide yes do you I not sure it's clear

441
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:24,510
anywhere in the document that I can't

442
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,390
just send a incremental and effectively

443
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,190
so I just say I accept what your success

444
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,140
what you're saying yeah and this is

445
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,030
something that we have to describe and

446
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:38,190
whatever we described will leave the

447
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:39,389
definition okay agreed and I'm gonna

448
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:46,550
look at David's code and see what it

449
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:51,120
does today by the way but you really so

450
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:54,300
oh I talked about drawing leave as was

451
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,590
mentioned by Stu who I don't know nice

452
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,620
to meet you

453
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,570
is that since we only have a multicast

454
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,590
Mac in the debt in the destination down

455
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,090
that you only do that on the final leave

456
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:11,810
so it's only when you have no more

457
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,810
listeners next

458
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,710
all right now on the other side how does

459
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,960
a sender know that there is a multicast

460
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,940
group out there with any listeners

461
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,850
I'm not saying who's listening I'm just

462
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,860
saying any listeners and what are the

463
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,899
right parameters there where the service

464
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,909
parameters related to that so this this

465
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,070
comes to that message that we talked

466
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:42,510
about that is the oh no we already

467
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:44,280
talked about the UH pronounce so the we

468
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,250
think the spec is pretty clear that

469
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,410
destination up is intended to cover this

470
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:54,660
it has in this back talks about logical

471
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:56,700
destinations the destination up is

472
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,380
identified as having a destination

473
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,930
address which we know it's this case a

474
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,320
logical one is what the spec uses but in

475
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,580
our case it's the multicast Mac and then

476
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,030
there's a list of associated IP

477
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,220
addresses it doesn't explicitly say

478
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,870
multicast but we think it goes there we

479
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:18,030
all agree that that was the intent so

480
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:20,669
that that's pretty clear CJ then we can

481
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:24,600
get a destination update to handle the

482
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:27,870
add/drop case and i believe you're right

483
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:32,250
with the flag and so I think that also

484
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,870
falls out of intended semantics and the

485
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,360
last thing we have is the station down

486
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:39,000
and here's the comment which is that's

487
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,350
only when the final listener leaves so

488
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,580
that's when there's no one out there on

489
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:48,810
the far side and again this is we think

490
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:50,610
that this was the intent reading it

491
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,500
before I even asked the question of the

492
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,629
authors we thought this was the intent

493
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,770
they came back and basically said this

494
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:03,000
is the intent I do have it captured in

495
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:06,000
like two slides but Rick made the point

496
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,830
that a destination may be maybe a

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,760
broadcast address and from our

498
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,220
standpoint we were just thinking

499
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,220
multicast and broadcast a special case

500
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,300
okay so that's but this one's also

501
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,390
pretty straightforward

502
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:23,270
the next one's more interesting how do

503
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,360
you know what endpoints are reachable

504
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,170
because you sort of want to know

505
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,699
that in this type of network it's

506
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:35,799
because since you're on an RF channel

507
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,420
someone might be move so distant that

508
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:40,030
they are not going to get the packet and

509
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,830
you can't assume it's like broadcast

510
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,309
needy it's you can't assume it's like a

511
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,480
LAN where just because one person is

512
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:49,389
joined everyone's going to be able to

513
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,730
hear you and which is part of a basic

514
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:56,440
design principle and IGMP any version we

515
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,470
need would probably need this

516
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,360
information how do we do it well as we

517
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,419
saw before

518
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:08,409
there's the IP address list that was

519
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:10,840
unqualified in both of the up as an

520
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,970
update and I added the qualification

521
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,459
that it's multicast it doesn't say that

522
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,220
it's just this list so there's no reason

523
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:23,860
why that list can't be first ulti cast

524
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:27,460
and then unicast IP addresses and I

525
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,719
think yeah Stan I thought you're gonna

526
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,610
call it a hack but I might have

527
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
responded this as pretty hacky or you

528
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,699
might have responded this is pretty high

529
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,409
one of us said it feels a little hacky

530
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:39,100
the nice thing is you don't have to

531
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,679
change the syntax I do believe is a

532
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,290
change in semantics and an unintended

533
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:51,309
one I went for inelegant as opposed to

534
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:55,570
it's a hack okay I'll go with that it's

535
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,918
an alligator you know you know and it is

536
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,590
a win that you don't have to go change

537
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,140
your encodings you know but I do think

538
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,149
it's a change in code and I actually

539
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,230
view that this is the motive everything

540
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,030
we've talked about this is the most

541
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,299
significant change even though it's not

542
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:13,120
an exchange student coding on the wire

543
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:15,580
and it's such a change I think it would

544
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:22,270
need to be documented and go through the

545
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:24,580
normal process it's to card again I'm

546
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,110
assuming that those two bullets they're

547
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,600
on destination dump and destination

548
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:32,620
update are intended to be conceptually

549
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,820
clear as opposed to intended to say yeah

550
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,770
this is what the parameter list is

551
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,178
really going to look like because a

552
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,129
multicast IP address is

553
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:41,690
distinguishable from a unicast IP

554
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:43,639
address so there's really only one

555
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,519
parameter there which is an IP address

556
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:48,729
list correct and in fact that's what's

557
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,340
in the document and that's where I

558
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,960
that's what I was suggesting that was

559
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,549
sort of everyone assumed everyone

560
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,139
understood it was both I you know

561
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:58,249
unicast and multicast but doesn't say

562
00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:01,070
that it would have been better to have

563
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:06,129
said that but you're absolutely correct

564
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:06,129
is this a conceptual this is not actual

565
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:13,639
just want to make a comment there and

566
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:17,299
this is staying again if we do that we

567
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:20,779
just need to be careful of the

568
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:23,779
destination up would be would be focused

569
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:25,909
on one multicast IP address at a time

570
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:27,679
and the listeners for that multicast IP

571
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:29,360
address otherwise you're going to

572
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,720
introduce some you could introduce some

573
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,629
ordering issues inside the TLB list that

574
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,950
we wanted to stay away from III know I

575
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:40,759
actually don't see what you're talking

576
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,830
about there because wait as the as the

577
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,919
previous comment said sue said that it

578
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:50,119
we can readily identify IP multicast

579
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,820
from unicast and there's to me there's

580
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,879
no reason why you can't have n multicast

581
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,369
addresses and n unicast addresses and

582
00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:00,860
there could be any order now

583
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:02,749
there's one point there subtlety there

584
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,119
is is if you wanted to say that the

585
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:07,490
groups had different sets of listeners

586
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,908
correct that would be the that would be

587
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:14,539
easy do you want to have so I didn't

588
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:17,299
mean to imply I actually intentionally

589
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:22,158
didn't want to imply and enlisted it

590
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:24,139
this way to set it to to prevent to

591
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,169
discussion we're having right now no to

592
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:29,928
it to imply to to imply that you didn't

593
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:32,090
get that information that semantically

594
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,179
we didn't provide the information of

595
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,549
which listeners were gonna get we're

596
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:42,289
listening to which IP multicast address

597
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:44,029
and maybe that's wrong maybe my comment

598
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:44,830
maybe my perspective is wrong I don't

599
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:47,270
know

600
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,040
yeah rich again

601
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,070
I didn't quite understand that last

602
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,760
point Luke do you want to have do you

603
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:59,330
want to understand who is subscribed to

604
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,550
the individual multicast addresses or do

605
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:05,689
you want to understand who is the union

606
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:07,399
of multicast addresses and it's

607
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,070
separately the union of listeners I

608
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:16,510
would say the former but either way that

609
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:20,510
has to be clarified fine I Roman felt I

610
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:23,390
may be very confused but in IP multicast

611
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,910
the sender never knows who's listening

612
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:34,130
as far as I can tell

613
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:36,890
well on a subnet level routers know who

614
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:41,350
the listeners are in in most routing

615
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,350
protocols or in many routing protocols

616
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:54,350
not the hosts but the routers you know

617
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:57,320
who your downstream router is that's

618
00:32:54,350 --> 00:33:00,199
similar just I understand what you tried

619
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,600
to do are you assuming that the senders

620
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,270
and the receivers are the dealer routers

621
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,360
yes not someone be kind of the Letran

622
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:10,429
correct that was subscribed correctly

623
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,830
you said IGP several times right so I'm

624
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:15,650
assuming that there could be someone be

625
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:19,189
handy the router yes that somehow joins

626
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:21,650
yes to some group over there yes and now

627
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,530
me that the look brother gets the join

628
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,280
the a GFP joining translates that into

629
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:31,040
something right and now I'm translating

630
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:37,370
my pin D I'm translating my pin behavior

631
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:40,190
into a subnet deal up the actual IGMP

632
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:44,770
message no my pin behavior it's your pin

633
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:47,110
behavior that's just a behavior right so

634
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,910
okay so what happens if I actually get

635
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:52,219
joined nothing else well what does pim

636
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:57,080
do you have to go to your routing

637
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:59,330
protocol so so you know you're a router

638
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,030
right so you have IGMP de host and you

639
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,350
may have IGMP on your cell

640
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:08,110
net but you're running PIM or bgp stuff

641
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:10,929
or other magic stuff between your

642
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:13,780
routers right okay so you're just trying

643
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,360
to do this for the de lip subnet it's

644
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,550
exactly for the deal up subnet and some

645
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:23,980
routing protocols need to know what the

646
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:25,780
listeners are it's two again and it's

647
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,310
probably foolish for someone who is ill

648
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:32,560
prepared as me to be speaking as much as

649
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:34,179
I am but that's awesome thank you um can

650
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,880
I infer from what you said a few minutes

651
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:42,880
ago that the destination up and

652
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,060
destination update messages may

653
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,330
propagate to different groups of

654
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:53,020
listeners depending upon which multicast

655
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:55,690
group we are talking about because okay

656
00:34:53,020 --> 00:35:01,690
so these are these these messages it can

657
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:08,440
we go back one so yeah that's good so

658
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:11,560
the the loop no one more back or forward

659
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,110
back so the first thing that you look

660
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,700
let's trace this through the subnet you

661
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:19,870
have listeners that say hey I'm

662
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:22,600
listening magic happens on the subnet on

663
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,759
the radio subnet to tell other people

664
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,529
that there's listeners out there I say

665
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,350
magic because deala that's outside the

666
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,670
scope of dalat but it's not outside the

667
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,490
scope of all the routing protocols in

668
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,620
this group is out the scope outside the

669
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,750
scope of my knowledge for radios they

670
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,710
avoid I don't know what happens there

671
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:43,930
but though that information propagates

672
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:47,400
it now property across the air and it

673
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:51,609
goes to other radios or other Moto's

674
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:55,060
next which then want to tell they're

675
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:56,650
attached routers that there's a possible

676
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,750
destination that they can send to

677
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,710
there's a possible Mac destination

678
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,670
that's out there that they can send to

679
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,880
and that's them through this mechanism

680
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:09,840
and it tells you which MAC addresses and

681
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,910
which IP multicast groups are available

682
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,480
that's what this is doing but it doesn't

683
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,799
tell you those endpoints

684
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,349
it just says these groups are out there

685
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,030
now let's say were the four of us are on

686
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:29,960
our network and everyone is subscribed

687
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:31,790
to this one group these two guys are the

688
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,430
first two guys are closer to me left and

689
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:37,009
right if I send they're gonna hear me

690
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:40,609
but you're too far away you're not gonna

691
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:44,510
hear me how do i how do how does my i as

692
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:48,859
a sending router know that how do i know

693
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,750
that maybe i have to do well i have to

694
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:53,290
do something different i can't assume

695
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,000
it's just gonna be delivered to you

696
00:36:53,290 --> 00:37:00,910
that's the next slide i may be reading

697
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,470
too much into better that question about

698
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,899
you know it's focusing it on one

699
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:08,270
particular multicast group at a time but

700
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,740
if I'm not reading too much into your

701
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,230
comment or question whichever it was

702
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,879
then there is a need-to-know argument

703
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:18,589
here that goes to both scalability and

704
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,270
privacy issues if there are a number of

705
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,740
nodes that need to know that I'm

706
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:25,099
listening on a particular multicast

707
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,078
group they do not all necessarily need

708
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:36,619
to know all of the multicast groups that

709
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:38,390
I am listening on so I'm assuming that

710
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,000
this is operating inside a single

711
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,910
routing domain a single control domain

712
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,359
and routing protocols you tend to push

713
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:51,078
around the information of you know at

714
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,089
least who your next hops are maybe not

715
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,359
everyone in the network and that's what

716
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:59,240
that's just what we're doing here so in

717
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,770
terms of privacy I don't think the

718
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,839
privacy is any different than the

719
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,290
routing protocol and any other domain in

720
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,150
terms of scalability this is has

721
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:12,230
different scalability properties than

722
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,329
you would have on a traditional land but

723
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,520
I think the problem is is you're not on

724
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:18,260
a traditional land and so your protocols

725
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,170
are designed to operate on artificial

726
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,640
land and make assumptions you're they're

727
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:26,329
gonna assume that there's delivery in

728
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,040
the case that there's not and so your

729
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:29,870
since you're dealing with this

730
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,350
I'll see medium you have to accommodate

731
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:35,270
it and that's what this is all about

732
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:38,480
this is Stan again I'd like to go back

733
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:42,800
to the the example you were talking

734
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:46,280
about earlier where you were on a deal

735
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,980
up subnet you can see Rick as a router

736
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,200
you can see me but you can't see student

737
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:54,860
and you're trying to figure out as a

738
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,600
sender how to how to cope with that well

739
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,150
I said I couldn't reach him for

740
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,950
multicasts right I mean that's said he

741
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:05,990
might be show up as an endpoint for

742
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:07,370
unicast yeah and if this is contrived

743
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,799
and doesn't make sense from your

744
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:12,020
favorite radio technology I accept that

745
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,450
because I'm not a radio guy I am making

746
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,640
this up I admit it okay I wouldn't know

747
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:20,600
I was just gonna say that that seems to

748
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,900
me like the it's a problem that has to

749
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,279
be solved that you the sender it's kind

750
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,010
of like the classic hidden terminal

751
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,220
problem right it's not your problem to

752
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,660
solve it's mine and Rick's to realize

753
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,250
that students back there and he can't

754
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:39,379
hear so we've got to propagate forward

755
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:41,990
wait and so let's change it let's let's

756
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:45,890
change the topology you guys are in

757
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:47,419
front of me over there right so you

758
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,279
can't solve the problem either

759
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,130
well if he's over there far enough that

760
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,350
you can't see him or you can't hear no

761
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,670
idea you're blind I hear - a unicast

762
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,430
Center but I can't get reaching as a

763
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,340
multicast right that's I mean there are

764
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:13,609
cases there where that's just broke I

765
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:15,230
don't know how to fix that right for the

766
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:18,290
benefit of microphone Rick I was just

767
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:20,210
clarifying to Stu that the privacy issue

768
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,759
we're kind of sidestepping by saying

769
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,910
deal it talks about single there two

770
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,970
domains so it's all about just one small

771
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,520
land this information isn't propagating

772
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,620
out over some extended network and that

773
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,270
allows us to kind of sidestep those

774
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:39,680
previous issues he raised well I would

775
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,210
sidestep etre saying you're inside a

776
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:52,640
single administrative domain

777
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:57,619
yeah yeah so I so I think I think we

778
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,940
this this is the last question I had so

779
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:02,119
now we're gonna move on to some other

780
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:07,250
points that came up Rick do you want to

781
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:09,380
come up and talk to your I don't know

782
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:15,050
what Rick was saying here so I don't

783
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:16,880
think the I think the the main my main

784
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,700
takeaway from here whether it was Rick's

785
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,099
point or not is is that when you say

786
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,618
multicast we really want to make sure we

787
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:25,970
include broadcast in there too and I

788
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,369
think it's a couple of the valid point

789
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,509
and I completely agree I don't know if

790
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:40,180
there was any other points you wanted to

791
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:42,140
make on the slide okay next now this is

792
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,990
something that's come up a couple of

793
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:48,020
times I'm throwing it in here to foster

794
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,950
discussion it is not my discussion so I

795
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:54,710
don't want to lead it

796
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:58,368
in fact from my standpoint I'm not sure

797
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:04,010
I care about this but then again I can

798
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:06,680
see that there are uses of him and you

799
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,390
know I'm a dense mode fan so I'm not a

800
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,980
sparse mode fan that's but that's why I

801
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:13,819
said I don't care about it it's not that

802
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:18,710
I don't care about multicast but I don't

803
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:20,660
I'm not a fan of our P's and I'm not our

804
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,119
peas that are unaware of what's

805
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,430
happening at the power at the subnet

806
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,280
level for like right power distribution

807
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,779
right because you don't know this is

808
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,849
Stan again I mean let me give you an

809
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,920
example of at least in my case where

810
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:36,710
this started and that's in some

811
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,180
satellite systems you have the notion of

812
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,480
what's called a Network Controller node

813
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:49,250
for the satellite so at later - you have

814
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:52,730
a really important box there and we

815
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,970
started with the notion the really vague

816
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,849
notion of try

817
00:42:53,970 --> 00:43:00,828
to communicate the fact that from a

818
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:03,329
layer two perspective this modem is

819
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:06,180
somehow special

820
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:07,799
it has capabilities that don't

821
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,140
necessarily exist elsewhere in the

822
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:12,420
network for the network controller it's

823
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,098
it's pretty obvious it's you're

824
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,839
guaranteed they have in a satellite

825
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:17,450
network anyway you're guaranteed to have

826
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,788
connectivity to all the downstream

827
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:24,868
points and then we kind of started

828
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:30,270
monkeying around with different use

829
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:33,200
cases from that kind of flowed from that

830
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:36,690
so I don't know that this is actually

831
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,910
coalesced as an idea but it's it's one

832
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,299
that we've been talking about it's very

833
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:44,819
typical and routing protocols to have an

834
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:47,609
ability to discover capabilities about

835
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:50,099
other nodes in the network and I think

836
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:51,598
you're saying you're you want deal up to

837
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,140
help you in that regard

838
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:59,309
yeah and I want deal it to help me with

839
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:02,328
not only am i as a router capable extra

840
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:07,200
capable but perhaps my modem is as well

841
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:09,839
yeah so to me this this becomes a anyone

842
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,970
remember Ian and I I met a grouting par

843
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,640
right this is like par where you could

844
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,160
the the higher level could inject some

845
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,529
information into the lower level routing

846
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,170
protocol or lower level and basically

847
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:25,079
provide a distribution and discovery

848
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,910
function so you could advertise some

849
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,619
bits in and then everyone else is out

850
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:32,069
there learns about those bits without

851
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:34,279
you exchanging any other information so

852
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:39,089
I mean because you could just do this

853
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:41,220
okay so one of my use cases was there

854
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:42,839
are a number of routing protocols and

855
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,868
data dissemination protocols and so on

856
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:47,970
out there which you have a leader in

857
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:49,559
order to maintain consensus on that data

858
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,879
so you have a leadership election and

859
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,920
you go read the papers on this thing and

860
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
it's great and they say pick the node at

861
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,390
the lowest node ID great he'll be the

862
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,700
he'll be that the the leader today when

863
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,170
he finds to go to the next guy the

864
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,000
problem is if you're running on some of

865
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,369
these mesh radio systems or a hub and

866
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,480
spokes icon system the guy with the

867
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,599
lowest node ID

868
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,760
might be in a tunnel and clever hidden

869
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,520
terminal stuff is keeping that layer -

870
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,339
going so this is an ability for the

871
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,550
modem to report back to the radio to say

872
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:23,400
I am NOT a good guy to be elected the

873
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,710
leader because I'm fighting really hard

874
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,990
to even stay connected please don't make

875
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:33,150
me the broadcast point you know when

876
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:36,029
you're not a unicast overlay stuff and

877
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:38,730
the we went on from that to say the

878
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:40,320
Reuter being able to suggest to the

879
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,520
modem that he was thinking about

880
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,720
becoming one of these leaders and for

881
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,710
the modem to be able to say no I don't

882
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,078
think that's a good idea

883
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,550
that's the item that was the concept we

884
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,880
were playing around with is so that the

885
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:56,460
modem can say in the view you have at

886
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,500
layer 3 that seems like a good idea but

887
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,150
where I am down at there 1 there -

888
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,170
that's a bad idea

889
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:06,089
oh the opposite hey I am the spoke of

890
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,869
this icon system I'm running at a dirty

891
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:11,759
great data center make me the leader why

892
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:13,109
is this not like just one of the other

893
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,750
resource parameters that are already

894
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:19,200
there I don't remember all of that why

895
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:21,630
is it this just like I I'm low latency I

896
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,609
have good bandwidth I have good signal

897
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:26,190
quality why isn't it why is it any

898
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:29,640
different than that because it's yeah

899
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,380
it's because it's it's a yeah it's I

900
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,430
have good bandwidth I have good latency

901
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,480
that's fine because the climatic

902
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,700
environment is great we're in a nice

903
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,900
clear sunny day and we're all to see

904
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,980
each other which was we're on a flat

905
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:45,420
plane it's particularly some of the more

906
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,910
complex meshing radio systems they're

907
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,470
already building trees they have the

908
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,390
idea of you know they're doing their

909
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,810
internal tree building to keep the RF

910
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:56,640
system running if the head of that tree

911
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,319
can say hey I'm the head of the tree if

912
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,839
I'm having two broadcasts but you're

913
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,400
building an overlay Network use me as

914
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:05,190
the head of your tree because I am

915
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,460
already a tree yeah you know I'm already

916
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,800
a root node hi god I hate to step in but

917
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:15,720
I just want to ask the group we're

918
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,010
starting to get close on time we've only

919
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,549
got about 13 minutes left 13 about 13

920
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:24,060
Ronald has a

921
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:26,220
such a short session I'm done it was

922
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:28,049
just an hour session so do you want to

923
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,430
continue does a group want to continue

924
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,780
on this topic do we want to hear the

925
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,140
other top personally I'd like to hear

926
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:38,760
what he has to say hi I would too

927
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:40,379
all right I realize we're so short so I

928
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,810
think the outcome from this the takeaway

929
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:46,200
is we should work on the document on the

930
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,130
four topics this one is as if as a

931
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,629
separate thing

932
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:53,460
that Rick and Stan will run run with and

933
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,350
I think at least Rick wants to

934
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,690
participate in this multiple casts

935
00:47:55,350 --> 00:48:00,270
clarifications document plan or you'd

936
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,470
like to who's well me awesome can I get

937
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:06,500
one of you guys to take the first draft

938
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:15,569
of it yes you can volunteer awesome

939
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:58,290
thank you I'm not seeing your slides

940
00:48:15,570 --> 00:49:00,590
Ronnie it says men a so hi I'm Romain

941
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:05,000
felt I work for Tino the Netherlands I

942
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:07,440
appreciate being given the time and

943
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,260
especially now that we are in the middle

944
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,100
of an interesting discussion that we may

945
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:16,140
want to continue at some other time but

946
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,250
on the other on the other end this

947
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:21,870
discussion is about

948
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:25,110
d-lab and it's in my feelings training

949
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:27,330
more and farther and farther away what

950
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:32,340
is it originally the men a working group

951
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:38,310
was about so

952
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:42,480
I try to just throw in an idea and gauge

953
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:44,730
if there's any interest for people in

954
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,800
the room or and mailinglist to to work

955
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:52,740
on this and what I want to work on

956
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:56,490
personally is connecting different

957
00:49:52,740 --> 00:50:00,419
managers together in a situation where

958
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:03,720
you have multiple different manage

959
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,670
potentially running different money

960
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:11,399
routing protocols routing protocols

961
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:16,250
whatever internally these monies could

962
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,250
be using one or more types of radios

963
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:21,060
obviously if there ever come to talk to

964
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:25,050
each other they have to have a common

965
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:27,950
radio common waveform but not all the

966
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:33,330
notes within M&A have to have this extra

967
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:38,669
radio modem whatever so a subset has

968
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:40,620
this and that can be used to form some

969
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:46,530
kind of coalition or some kind of

970
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:48,359
Federation of monies and then they need

971
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,480
to be able to exchange routing

972
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:55,560
information with each other if a note

973
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:59,370
from one money is ever going to speak to

974
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:03,180
a note in another money so you could

975
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:06,330
think of a large-scale disaster recovery

976
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:09,569
operation with several parties involved

977
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:13,170
and that's the usual euphemism I'm not

978
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:17,670
going to say any more about that next

979
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:25,080
slide you can are your clicker I always

980
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:29,630
get this wrong time yeah go back to your

981
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:38,370
key question so I think this is exactly

982
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:41,970
what Pascal butchers name zone said is

983
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:42,779
trying to get at with the whole raw and

984
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,910
pas

985
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:48,220
activity there was a Boff on it

986
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,930
last meeting he didn't give his boss

987
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:54,399
material in on time so it's a site

988
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:56,680
meeting on Thursday morning at 8:30 and

989
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,330
what he's talking about is is he but he

990
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,370
really has focused on that net over

991
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:02,290
wireless but I think he really wants

992
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,799
this yeah what you're talking about

993
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:08,610
there

994
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,610
okay so there's others who care about

995
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,870
Rick Taylor who's in the room I really

996
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:18,129
care about this you and I have had side

997
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,529
conversations about this for a while so

998
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:22,870
I'm just adding a public plus one to

999
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,040
this whether it's raw or whether it

1000
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:26,500
happens in melee or whatever this is

1001
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:30,120
this is important because okay you know

1002
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,990
maybe so trying to figure these days

1003
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:40,990
okay this might be obvious

1004
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:42,669
it's melayu so when I have a tendency of

1005
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:46,720
splitting and merging if everyone is

1006
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:49,300
driving around walking around you have

1007
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,350
to have these gateway notes who are the

1008
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,520
potential connection points you can

1009
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:58,080
pre-select them or they can be

1010
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,210
dynamically selected by some mechanism

1011
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:05,590
obviously they run two or more money

1012
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:09,550
routing routing protocols you could use

1013
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:11,380
flat route for redistribution but you

1014
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:14,140
have to be careful there and we have

1015
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,660
some experience here before you know it

1016
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,790
you have a routing loop and the other

1017
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:22,720
idea is to have some kind of yeah we

1018
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:24,880
could call it overlay protocol or an

1019
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:33,129
exterior gateway protocol so to speak

1020
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:36,640
for minase typically in the wired world

1021
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:38,560
you use BGP and to connect autonomous

1022
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,339
systems and the autonomous systems are

1023
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,730
running a GPS but that's not very suited

1024
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:48,250
there's there's ample literature about

1025
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:52,240
how PGP is not going to work in a

1026
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:56,770
managed situation so we need something

1027
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,209
new and again in literature this has

1028
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:01,550
been explored to some extent

1029
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:04,670
but there are no usable implementations

1030
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:07,869
at the moment and most of the papers are

1031
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:10,910
very sketchy about how to exactly do it

1032
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:15,230
these are a few references there are

1033
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:18,319
more so my question to the working group

1034
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:22,220
is is there any interest to do this work

1035
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:26,029
and that would start I guess with doing

1036
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:28,279
with writing a problem statement see

1037
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:31,190
what's already out there and then

1038
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,290
possibly write and protocol

1039
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:38,470
specification which in the first

1040
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,470
instance may aim for experimental status

1041
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,899
Rick Taylor I would go straight for

1042
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:47,030
proposed and if we're gonna bother to do

1043
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,490
this I think there's enough experimental

1044
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:53,690
I hope that you quote the academic

1045
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:55,598
papers and I'm always a little wary from

1046
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,829
an implementer perspective of

1047
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,960
experimental RFC's they were either

1048
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:01,369
educational but I think we should aim

1049
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,650
standards track if we're going to do

1050
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:10,940
this that's fine with me too I don't

1051
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:12,890
know yeah I I tried to so and I'm yeah

1052
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,319
this is nothing the Charter at all so we

1053
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:25,328
probably need to go go through some

1054
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:25,329
recharter thing and that's all hey

1055
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:43,040
I love you work but I've also the

1056
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:48,589
opinion that you can tweak any router

1057
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:50,359
purple do anything you want so before we

1058
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:52,730
start down the road finding a new

1059
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:54,319
routing protocol yeah let's see what we

1060
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:57,890
have and if there's anything that we can

1061
00:55:54,319 --> 00:56:00,619
do with what we have right mics and yes

1062
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:02,560
there's proposal whatever all those

1063
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:09,160
things yes

1064
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:12,820
who needs recharter I am incredibly

1065
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,680
happy you can't imagine how much when I

1066
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:17,560
walked into this room and saw 12 people

1067
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,919
sitting here because this probably the

1068
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:23,470
biggest attendance we've had in the last

1069
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:29,800
three years combined for all the last

1070
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:30,730
meetings in the last three years so I'm

1071
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,150
saying all this because yes we would

1072
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:36,730
need to reach order we need to have not

1073
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:39,570
just the words in the Charter we need to

1074
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:43,720
have the energy in the water as well so

1075
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:45,370
you know what I would say is is what I

1076
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,470
would like to see is you know

1077
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:51,220
discussions in the group in this

1078
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:54,009
direction yes as we get closer yes we

1079
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,120
can reach artwork I mean the working was

1080
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,580
always charted to the oil as hard

1081
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:03,400
whatever so we could do something else

1082
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:05,259
right when we get there I would you not

1083
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:11,380
want to reach Artur before we see the

1084
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:13,660
the thrust going and I I apologize for

1085
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:16,590
not having brought this earlier and on

1086
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:24,339
the mailing list as I should have

1087
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:27,340
involved in other things the cynic in me

1088
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:29,920
would say that if if there's a non

1089
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,990
working group forming both full of great

1090
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,290
ideas meeting on Thursday morning and

1091
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:38,379
they have sufficient momentum to work on

1092
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:40,840
it and it's similar to this then rather

1093
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,970
than forming a new working group isn't

1094
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,890
that a bunch of active participants and

1095
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,830
some strong ideas that could reach out

1096
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:50,410
or an existing working group and bring

1097
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:56,470
it all here otherwise we're just the

1098
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:58,779
dealer working group sorry so that I

1099
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:01,600
mean mischaracterized but Thursday is

1100
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:04,450
it's a site meaning so it's not a ball

1101
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,799
it's not a non-work they wanted to but

1102
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:07,029
they didn't get their act together so

1103
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,110
they're gonna if they don't want a

1104
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,930
working group they're gonna have to go

1105
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:14,440
they're gonna have to go through and I

1106
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:15,890
think they're I think their ideas are

1107
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,900
very interesting and they're still in

1108
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:21,140
and they're still in development their

1109
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:23,779
mayor very much focused on the use case

1110
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:28,220
which is a little different it's not

1111
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:33,380
general teachability days traffic it's

1112
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:35,808
it's service based I do think there's a

1113
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,910
role for you up in there and there may

1114
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:40,279
be a role for bringing these things

1115
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:41,629
together I would suggest showing up

1116
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:44,539
there and hearing what they have to say

1117
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:48,589
and telling them where they should go if

1118
00:58:44,539 --> 00:58:50,329
they're confused and if it ends up here

1119
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:53,170
that's fine I think there is a big

1120
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:57,349
question about where that work ends up

1121
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:59,869
and the most positive things about a new

1122
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:02,329
working group is maybe a bit more energy

1123
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,650
for the room but this that meet if it's

1124
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:05,660
better to bring the energy into this

1125
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:09,920
room and hijack that's weird that one

1126
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:11,720
suit so there's a lot of things I don't

1127
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,109
think this is a decision that is now

1128
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,759
because there that you know they're

1129
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:18,430
gonna have a bond from Singapore so

1130
00:59:16,759 --> 00:59:21,589
that'll be a discussion after Singapore

1131
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:23,779
now if you show up you can understand

1132
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:26,720
maybe help form their ideas a little bit

1133
00:59:23,779 --> 00:59:28,999
better and align them to your interests

1134
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,509
so I do think it's worth showing up

1135
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:38,808
there we'll just even if you're just

1136
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:42,489
learning and definitely the AV currently
