00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,429
[Music]

2
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:08,759
Wow

3
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,080
should we get started okay good

4
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,930
afternoon almost evening if you wanna

5
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:37,039
this is the mile working group session

6
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,130
so if you are not expecting to talk

7
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:46,040
about the managed consent like in

8
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:49,250
exchange you may want to switch rooms so

9
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,210
hopefully everybody is familiar with the

10
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:59,660
note well I'm trying to look at faces is

11
00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:07,758
anybody new to mile no good so just be

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:15,380
cognizant of the ITF note well rules for

13
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:17,540
the agenda today I think yeah we have

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,079
TBD so I'm going to go flip these two

15
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:25,519
slides so I want to thank Dave for

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,519
taking notes on the ether pad anybody

17
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:32,620
else who's willing to help you're using

18
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:35,690
the ether pad link that is in the IETF

19
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,680
agenda so feel free to click on that and

20
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,950
you can see the the notes being taken

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,730
live the minutes and Thank You Mia for

22
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:50,690
being our jabber scribe so for the

23
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,660
agenda today we can go through hopefully

24
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:59,450
rather quick on the miles status and

25
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:03,709
then we'll have an update on the JSON io

26
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:08,209
def draft which I believe Alexi had a

27
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:12,440
conflict today has gone through and the

28
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:15,640
state has now changed meaning the last

29
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,410
call it's now going towards the iesg

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,730
publication comment review and

31
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,320
publication so I don't think we need to

32
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,320
discuss on that other than to provide

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,549
updates based on the feedback because we

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,850
had quite a few comments

35
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,550
that one and then we'll get excuse me

36
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,930
clarify the precise state of JSON I you

37
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,030
deaf I just checked in the data tracker

38
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,190
it's actually in still an IETF last call

39
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:45,800
until August first okay Aleksey okay let

40
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,290
me check in my email because I thought

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,390
that was going to be an update so maybe

42
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,859
it didn't get updated I think about it

43
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,540
it can still get updated despite the

44
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,270
fact that it's in last call but it's it

45
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:00,739
last call flight oh okay thank you for

46
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:04,640
that clarification mm-hmm okay and then

47
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:10,450
from there we'll have the updates on our

48
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:14,290
two remaining outstanding drafts the

49
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:17,988
extensions basically to to Roley and

50
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,010
then we have a little bit of time left

51
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:25,099
so if there's any other business we can

52
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:27,860
address those as well so any other

53
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,190
things that you guys want to add or

54
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,310
modify on the agenda blue sheet we have

55
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,260
one blue sheet up here so if anybody

56
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,260
needs it

57
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,900
okay so I've already thanked the

58
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:46,159
volunteers with respect to the

59
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,260
milestones I think we we need to talk to

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,800
a Lexie because if you look at the

61
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:56,090
milestones dates and the actual mile

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,960
website we need to update those but from

63
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:04,969
the actual work we did finally publish

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:08,060
the XMPP grid it's now our CAA 600 the

65
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,790
JSON IO dev has received quite a few

66
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:17,050
comments during its last call we need to

67
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:20,510
confirm from the ad that it can move on

68
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,930
and then we have two remaining drafts

69
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:28,039
that I'd like to ensure we have enough

70
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,830
reviews so that we can put the last call

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:40,190
and get the shepherding going towards

72
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:41,859
publication okay so with that I think we

73
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,490
already

74
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,930
went through the the discussions of what

75
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:52,240
happened in Prague and how we're

76
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:56,470
proceeding now with respect to the

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,949
vulnerability draft I'm not sure tacky I

78
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:04,930
think I saw comments from you from the

79
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:09,159
vulnerability but I'm not sure I saw

80
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:17,110
comments from Jess or from Kathleen okay

81
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:22,389
okay okay you need to provide comments

82
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:26,610
it's just to make sure that we have some

83
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,610
reviewers on the vulnerability draft

84
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:42,370
yeah and Chris just thank you Chris okay

85
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:46,449
well I've got to go back and take take

86
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,960
account yeah so I was asking for at

87
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,650
least three reviewers and the same thing

88
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,880
on the see sort of extension draft I

89
00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:15,878
honestly don't remember seeing any

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:17,889
feedback well your name is on there and

91
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:22,360
that's okay I was bad at Nanjing people

92
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:24,550
too so um so if you can tell me Stephen

93
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:30,849
later who all the reviewers where I can

94
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:32,800
go back and see and and then what I'd

95
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:36,580
like to do at the end of the session is

96
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,289
to take a notion of who's reviewed it

97
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,770
and whether we believe we're ready for a

98
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:51,120
last call for both drafts okay all right

99
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:51,120
so with that let me who's presenting

100
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,570
is it you

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:05,660
yes okay so tacky is dissenting so this

102
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,750
is just a brief update of SIBO Jason

103
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,670
binding of AOF draft so nothing that

104
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,940
important has changed most of the

105
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:18,200
comments were editorial basically it's

106
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:23,930
mapping between basic base are you deaf

107
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:26,120
XML spec and JSON spec was discussed not

108
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:37,700
so many was changed only a torial you

109
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:41,120
can see so as you can see working a

110
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,610
blast coded completed and AD and RFC has

111
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,320
already provided me some comments he

112
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,180
also provided me some opening comments

113
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,250
regarding some editorial sound like a

114
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,859
language staff so it's much better now

115
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,920
by now and we are currently in the

116
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,570
process of the IETF last call

117
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,880
secretarial already provided the review

118
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,710
but the quantities are nothing this

119
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
adjust the content they are the same

120
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,120
like the basic spec so there is no

121
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,640
additional concern when we have a Jason

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,220
binding so Secretary was completed which

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,650
I didn't problem for the Jane heart

124
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:16,550
review he provided a bit more comments

125
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:20,720
regarding its mapping between XML and

126
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,810
JSON and actually I really already have

127
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,290
replied and I don't see any big problem

128
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,939
at all

129
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,980
I'm just hoping to receive some

130
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,640
confirmation that the changes I made

131
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,070
what's good from the standpoint was a

132
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,500
reviewer but anyway no major issue

133
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,560
raised until now so hopefully we can

134
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,980
publish the draft ASAP that's about it

135
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,979
thank you

136
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,639
all the changes so you you mean

137
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,040
published okay I did it but only in the

138
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,079
github you got to change it that so

139
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,860
small I didn't think we had better

140
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:02,500
publish to the next version or if

141
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,870
necessary I can publish as that you need

142
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,660
to so that Alexi and then we can check

143
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,389
with Alexi to you to publish right so

144
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:16,540
that he can push that version okay I

145
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:19,620
understand okay is that it

146
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:28,000

00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,550
changes really quick so everyone's up to

168
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,589
date on what's been done to the

169
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,420
vulnerability Draft some of the

170
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,399
formatting has been updated in the

171
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,079
vulnerability draft to more closely

172
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,060
match the template that we've been

173
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,199
building out for Roly extensions it

174
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,790
helps it a little bit more readable

175
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,130
helps you follow the requirements a

176
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,099
little bit more easily that doesn't

177
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,510
include any normative changes and really

178
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,829
the formatting wasn't that far off in

179
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,460
the first place so this is not a major

180
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,140
overhaul

181
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,839
this is just kind of bringing a couple

182
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,370
sections in line and shifting the

183
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,200
hierarchy around a little bit just to

184
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,180
make it flow the same way other ones

185
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:17,760
there's no no major changes as part of

186
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:21,699
this we've removed the video from the

187
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,830
volunteer the vulnerability description

188
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,529
ontology was determined to be too

189
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,950
unstable it's still in a draft format

190
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,779
that's an is publication and so we've

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,029
decided to remove that from this

192
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,070
document and when the time comes if the

193
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:45,250
time comes a separate document can be

194
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:48,990
written for that format this is for the

195
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:52,029
there are two different formats for CVEs

196
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,130
that's used there's an XML format as

197
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:59,080
well as a JSON format those are the nvd

198
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,459
XML and NVD JSON formats in order to

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,740
make the differences between

200
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,510
requirements more clear I've split the

201
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,310
text into two sections made it a little

202
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,980
bit more readable and it flow a little

203
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,959
bit better that doesn't change the

204
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,390
requirements the requirements are the

205
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,719
same the intent is the same the wording

206
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:18,310
should just make it much more clear okay

207
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,130
and that was the most recent version of

208
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,900
vulnerability that was just posted new

209
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,250
version of C cert was just posted and

210
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,290
then another new version after that to

211
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,400
include Chris's changes the this was

212
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,290
actually changed it was made almost

213
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,339
immediately after the last IETF but I

214
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,660
wanted to include it here

215
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:41,920
the /resource location requirement is

216
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:45,480
reduced because the requirement is

217
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,260
inherited from 8:30 to 2:00 and

218
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,680
increasing the severity of that

219
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,880
requirement was deemed not necessary and

220
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,550
put an undue stress on on implementers

221
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,500
the /resource already is fully

222
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,469
compatible and fully interoperable with

223
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,720
with Rowley and with this extension and

224
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,890
you don't need more requirements to make

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,930
that the case so I see the I think that

226
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,230
was the only normative change in the

227
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,729
caesar document and then a lot of typos

228
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,200
spelling errors and things were fixed as

229
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:25,000
well the one major typo that was changed

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,310
and this was thanks to Chris's comment

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,660
and I'm forgetting exactly what it was

232
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,150
because it was like hours ago that I

233
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,740
made it and I did not I did not update

234
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:37,060
this PowerPoint hours ago

235
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,240
so I well these changes were made

236
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,520
against the revision the version that

237
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,650
Chris review yeah correct

238
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,199
time right yes so these dis is all

239
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,970
accurate what I mean

240
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,380
I'll send a note to list of that other

241
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,000
change that was I'm in fact I already

242
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,810
sent a note to list about it so it

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:05,350
that's fine okay so I think that both of

244
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:09,280
these documents are done and ready I've

245
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,260
received a lot of good review and I'll

246
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,810
get an exact list of reviewers to you

247
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,520
Nancy I think you wanted some more and I

248
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:20,290
think we can probably pin down a few

249
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:22,689
more just wanted to confirm right we can

250
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:27,370
confirm that yeah

251
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:29,710
so I'm actually fine doing well we need

252
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,650
to take consensus in the group so a

253
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,680
question for you on the vulnerability

254
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,020
extensions where you had removing the

255
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,770
video where all of those changes in

256
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:44,230
response to comments you received the

257
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,780
removal of video was not in response to

258
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,750
a comment that was response to the

259
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,780
author well just literally only me isn't

260
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,210
it for vulnerability thinking that the

261
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,560
and I was I was the one who thought it

262
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,130
was appropriate to add in the first

263
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,750
place and received some amount of you

264
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:10,240
know vocal support that that could be a

265
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:13,350
decent thing to add we'd be gay then it

266
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,360
was a right move I'm just asking us to

267
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,860
the changes that you made whether they

268
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,060
were all due to comments I remove video

269
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,060
because it was an unstable reference

270
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:34,480
okay so yeah I think they're both ready

271
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:36,970
there is one issue outstanding for both

272
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,529
documents and this is actually in

273
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,499
response to Chris's comments as well as

274
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:44,169
talkie comment takis comments they've

275
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:47,009
both pointed out that there is normative

276
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,910
language in the documents they are

277
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:51,009
specifications that are written to

278
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,040
ensure interoperability between

279
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:55,540
implementations and that would imply

280
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,988
that these should be standards track

281
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,199
documents well they are extensions they

282
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:04,169
should be standard documents right so I

283
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,329
don't think there would be any issue in

284
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:11,230
changing that designator to standards as

285
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:14,938
we move to last call so before you move

286
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,939
it to last call I think it would be good

287
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:21,240
just make the change but let me just ask

288
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:27,089
in the group if there are any objections

289
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,089
to seeing it change to standards track

290
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:37,539
okay for it to move from - from

291
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,899
informational standards track I think

292
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:44,350
some care has to be taken to update some

293
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:47,620
of the references in the in the document

294
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:51,610
because you like for CVE the references

295
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,799
actually just to like www CBE might org

296
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,928
what isn't yeah absolutely

297
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:01,210
split between normative and informative

298
00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:03,460
and the reference that's yeah we'll have

299
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,500
to make sure the normative language is

300
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,710
clear versus informative

301
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,539
I think reviewers so this is an opinion

302
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,070
I think reviewers have been effectively

303
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,389
treating this document as a standards

304
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,889
document because there's a lot of

305
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:16,750
normative language in it I think that's

306
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:20,590
how it was understood but we could ask

307
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,919
for more review yes having only a

308
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,918
handful of hours ago I would say that it

309
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,720
does well with with actually being

310
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,450
formatted more like a standards document

311
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,440
than an informational document so -

312
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,400
going over the the references I'm

313
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:44,630
concerned about that kind of

314
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:48,730
Jeannie okay so I think I'm okay and

315
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:53,510
saying just convert let me know when

316
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:57,110
you've done that and I can put a working

317
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:00,500
group last call okay before we put it

318
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:04,189
out yes every state yep sounds like a

319
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:11,210
plan to me okay all right thanks

320
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:12,920
everyone yeah I tend to go over on these

321
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:19,550
things but I really kind of got it short

322
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:21,020
this time I'm not bad okay so I'm kind

323
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,570
of hopeful and optimistic here

324
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:29,750
especially since everybody's got their

325
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:38,419
eyes on their laptops so how many people

326
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:42,290
have read the drafts nice nice try okay

327
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:51,080
how many people have read the documents

328
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:53,360
and only two three okay I don't know if

329
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:59,300
it's fair to ask if we believe they're

330
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:01,550
ready for working group last call so why

331
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,800
don't you give me the updates I will

332
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,169
post them and I will ask the question

333
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,139
which I need to confirm actually I don't

334
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:14,150
but I can ask to confirm whether we're

335
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,640
ready or I could just based on the

336
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:21,440
reviews I could just start a working

337
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:25,970
group last call yeah okay so in my

338
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:29,810
optimistic form if we can start the

339
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:32,240
working group last call and we can get

340
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:41,510
the reviewers and I promise the non-jew

341
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:46,280
Kathleen then then perhaps we don't need

342
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:49,280
to have a session in Singapore are there

343
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:58,040
any objections or comments or

344
00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:00,170
to that so as as the author of basically

345
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,810
the two last outstanding drafts I think

346
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,120
that sounds reasonable I think that if

347
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,889
we can get this last call going and and

348
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,500
really get the review in there and then

349
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,150
keep it moving that there's not really

350
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,840
anything that we couldn't just do over

351
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,120
lists and I think at the most maybe a

352
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,179
virtual interim if we need one but I'm

353
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,310
imagining we finish this up on lists

354
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:26,120
well that's what I'm presuming and

355
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:30,830
hoping but that relies on responsiveness

356
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:33,949
on the chairs and I miss much to blame

357
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:40,760
as well as the author and the reviewers

358
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:43,490
so for the next version of the draft

359
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,670
during I guess once we open it to the

360
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,190
last call it would be good so Dave you

361
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,800
said you could review Chris you could

362
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,080
review Kathleen you could review so I

363
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,570
think and I'm presuming you can do both

364
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,939
drafts I mean talking you and I need to

365
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:03,470
review them so that's a given table

366
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,300
tomorrow just to be clear from the notes

367
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,540
you're suggesting we do those reviews as

368
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,540
part of the last call or yes okay yeah

369
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:17,179
that way I can actually you or taki

370
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:21,620
whoever Shepherds in to say it's gone

371
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:25,190
through we've addressed comments and go

372
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:29,020
through the full process goodness I

373
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:31,840
think are there any orders of business

374
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:35,780
going once going twice

375
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,750
okay I give you guys back 28 minutes

376
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,050
plus a little bit more or like 38

377
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:46,670
minutes thank you everyone

378
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:52,730
this has been good I'm hopeful unless we

379
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:55,790
receive a lot of comments right yeah

380
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:00,220
well right at that pays we would have to

381
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,220
do that yeah okay thank you everyone

382
00:23:01,940 --> 00:24:44,419
I was in offer Brett first mile down

383
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:52,700
that we could take some of the cacao

384
00:24:44,419 --> 00:25:01,039
work here okay hi hey I might return

385
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:04,279
this but you know taka was asking and he

386
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,470
said if Brent wanted to bring stuff that

387
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:09,529
could pertain to mine because some of

388
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:14,640
the capacitor is we could be chartered

389
00:25:09,529 --> 00:27:19,020
and keep mild going anything

390
00:25:14,640 --> 00:27:20,940
I can't see up there she worried the

391
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,639
other hearing about how I use my right

392
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,000
hands this one did was they optimized

393
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,000
