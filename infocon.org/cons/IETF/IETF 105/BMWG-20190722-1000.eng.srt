buttons we have to press here right it's

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,440
yeah it's this one and then we have to

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,530
see whether this works

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:44,599
oh yeah okay that button there got it's

10

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,849

14
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:04,760
we've got meeting materials no that's

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,760

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,930
[Music]

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:29,360
no wait a minute that's my friend do you

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,360
get chin

19
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:43,639
[Music]

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,520
hey bingo so all that red stuff is when

21
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,130
you get to the either pad all that red

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600
stuff is going to be the agenda and you

23
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,929
get this I don't think you can actually

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,369
delete stuff can we oh we can if you own

25
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:07,429
it you can delete it

26
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,530
okay so and and I'll ask somebody to

27
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,299
scrape screen scrape the ether pad

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,959
occasionally put in a text file because

29
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:18,060
things go wrong with ether pad and

30
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:24,090
that's an unfortunate reality of our

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:38,700
business alrighty so it's 10:01 I think

32
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:42,390
we can get going I'm not ready okay so

33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,859
Sara's gonna cover Jabbar today I guess

34
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,779
we've got a collective of a few people

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,489
who are taking meeting notes and

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,459
contributing to the ether pad that would

37
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,139
be great you know type in a few mostly

38
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,970
the action items that come up I mean

39
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,739
that's the kind of thing that's

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,959
interesting also the questions that are

41
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,120
raised these are the key points that we

42
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,989
want to capture and preserve for

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,370
posterity

44
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,349

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,120
working group we're in general asking

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,650
folks to move close to the front but

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,120

50
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,669
move so who are first-time attendees

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,340

52
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:30,870

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,470
lab if you have an interest in what

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,880
other people are testing and some of the

57
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,459
technologies that are on our agenda

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,079

group to join you can read some drafts

61
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,549

some of our fundamental RFC's and you'll

63
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,819
learn very quickly what it's like to

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,469
prepare an RFC in this area starting out

65
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,119
with an internet draft and so forth we

66
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:04,430
have a

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,420
you know on our webpage we have also a

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,769
supplementary page that kind of gives a

69
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:15,629
little guidance along these lines so

70
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:17,250
welcome all right use the clicker out so

71
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,298
here's the note well so we got to go

72
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
through this a little bit because this

73
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,870
is exactly the first meeting of the week

74
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,479
usually sort of hand wait and say have

75
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,870
you seen this already but we can't today

76
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,580
so we work as individuals and we try to

77
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,520
be nice to each other that's that's our

78
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,650
personal note well to you beyond that

79
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,700
basically everything you say at the

80
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:45,479
microphone every mail you send to our

81
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,450
list and sort of every other kind of

82
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,849
public conversation here is a kind of

83
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,250
considered a contribution to the IETF

84
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,800
you have to be aware of whether that

85
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,190
conversation on your part is covered by

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,340
IPR you need to disclose that you know

87
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,690
in a prompt fashion and so that's

88
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,969
basically what we're what we're asking

89
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,740
of folks today if you've got something

90
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,590
you're presenting for the first time or

91
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,919
a new time and it's covered by our PR

92
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:17,609
please let everybody know thank you

93
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,340
there's links there to sort out all the

94
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,470
details and if you have any questions

95
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:26,520
Sarah and I are not lawyers but we can

96
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,080
at least try to answer them so here's

97
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,719
our agenda and you can see right from

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,599
the top it's really full so we've got

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,660
the what we'll talk about the

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,760
benchmarking for evpn and PPV evpn

101
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,560
status what going to our charter and

102
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,729
milestones and the general working group

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,410
status all together then we've got the

104
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:49,979
we actually don't have a presentation

105
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:53,010
for number three I don't think I don't

106
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,889
think Karsten has joined us but I can

107
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,300
quickly give a status there and then we

108
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,130
have one other working group documents

109
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,590
the updates to the back to back frame

110
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:08,820
benchmark o P and a V and V s birth

111
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:11,130
testing so that's that's a topic I have

112
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,790
to cover as a participant I'll try to

113
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,550
remind you that I'm changing hats when I

114
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,560
that and we had to actually have quite a

115
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,090
good number of good comments on the list

116
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,530
so that's that should be a good

117
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,719
discussion so then we have the

118
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,669
continuing proposals you see the large

119
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
number of them there so we're gonna have

120
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,220
to restrain the time that we spent on

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,990
this and also a lot of remote presenters

122
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,810
you can see that indicated and and and

123
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,210
then we return to the VP VPN topic at

124
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,580
the end where you know we have a couple

125
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,109
of drafts and one at the end here where

126
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,080
we where we had some work list

127
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,110
discussion one one new proposal where we

128
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,990
have a brief presentation 5g transport

129
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,820
networking network benchmarking Luis

130
00:06:52,990 --> 00:07:02,770
Contreras Luis are you here Luiz no Luis

131
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,880
yet okay well and an FYI from vladimir

132
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,460
veselov

133
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,850
vladimir is present but he didn't plan

134
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,460
to present yet and but the draft is

135
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,770
available so folks can read that and by

136
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,840
the time of light Amir does person it

137
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,219
will be a better informed he's trying to

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,719
you know sort of understand how the

139
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,850
working group works and I think that's a

140
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,410
that's a great way to go also in general

141
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,050
you know when you come here and make a

142
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,210
proposal join the group read somebody

143
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,390
else's draft help them along they'll

144
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,469
help you along it so you know it's a

145
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,680
give-and-take kind of thing here

146
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:41,140
much appreciated any bashes to the

147
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:44,500
agenda see no requests for the floor

148
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,770
nobody hit the mic so um as I said we've

149
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,330
got the jabber and the IPR covered the

150
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,479
blue sheets are going around everybody

151
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,479
please sign the blue sheets where is the

152
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,880
blue sheet at the moment right up front

153
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,850
here so let's keep that circulating make

154
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,610
sure everybody's signed it and how many

155
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,720

156
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,850

157
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,580
twelve people in the room so let's get

158
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,230

in some notes for us help us out there

166
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:38,839
that would be great okay so here's the

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,940
status in the interim we've adopted the

168
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,700
back to back frame benchmarking it's an

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,630
update for the particular section in our

170
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,790
one of our fundamental rfcs RFC 2544 and

171
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,670
this is where we try to determine the

172
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,740
size of a buffer that the device under

173
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,910
test has and that turns out to be pretty

174
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,610
important we'll talk about the details

175
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,579
later we've got all these proposals with

176
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:06,320
drafts following up on on all of them

177
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,970
and you know there we go so we've got a

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,610
written this is the reason we have a

179
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,320
full agenda we've kind of blown through

180
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,900
all our milestones we have to fix that

181
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,080
it's real easy to update dates here and

182
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,329
four by a year I think roughly and and

183
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,790
and we might actually make it if if we

184
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,500
do August 2019 for next-gen firewall

185
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,900
that seems to make up all day they've

186
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,089
got a good draft and stuff I've read

187
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,550
well they're all 2018 so technically

188
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,860
speaking no no we're gonna update - well

189
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,040
I've seen them all so 2019 Isis and then

190
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,300
we'll make it

191
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,730
you're allowed you're allowed to update

192
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,260
you're allowed to do some updates we

193
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,980
when we put this in people went oh

194
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,760
really

195
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,140
August 20 18 you know wait well we

196
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,730
thought it was aggressive - and and I

197
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,939
think one of the problems is one of the

198
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,490
authors has left disposition but in any

199
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,470
case we'll there's good work that was

200
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,220
done there and I think we can get that

201
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:04,070
gone enough on that so keep looking for

202
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,580
the blue sheets folks who are arriving a

203
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,800
few minutes in and so here's where we

204
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,089
stand no new FCS no charter updates oh

205
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,370
you got a son this is a supplementary

206
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,440
page or folk for new folks joining the

207
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,450
group that's where you go to find out

208
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,170
you know all the details of things that

209
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,550
I just said very quickly so especially

210
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,529
for the new folks coming in especially

211
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,420
on top of which we have an awful lot of

212
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,080
virtualization work going on if there's

213
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,860
information you guys want to share tools

214
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,420
implementations you've seen of things

215
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,410
that we're adding please send me the

216
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,329
links and I'll make sure that we're

217
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,130
updating the page that stuff is

218
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,500
reflected in a central repository

219
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,810
because sometimes I find you actually

220
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,570
send out emails periodically reminding

221
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,369
of us of it and it might be good to list

222
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,710
that on the the page that's right

223
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,720
that's right in fact we Vladimir's and I

224
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,780
had a conversation about a truck to test

225
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,540
traffic generator product like during

226
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:00,170
the hackfest briefly so that interesting

227
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:04,849
stuff yeah okay thanks for the augment

228
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:08,030
there sorry alright so when you write an

229
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,820
internet draft here we are laboratory

230
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,699
only that's our Charter so we put this

231
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,350
nice paragraph into the some parts in

232
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,300
the intro some parts in the security

233
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,490
considerations section and when the

234
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,530
security people read it they go oh okay

235
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,030
it's alright now and so that's very

236
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,949
important to let them know when they

237
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,689
review the draft that we're lab only and

238
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:31,160
you know we're not doing this stuff on

239
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:32,720
the live network and I haven't really

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,430
updated this to conclude all the

241
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,980
proposals obviously but here's the ones

242
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,959
we have adopted recently and they're all

243
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,670
in the green there and so you can see

244
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,220
the kinds of things we evaluate when

245
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:47,810
we're looking at proposals for adoption

246
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:51,010
okay so that's the chair slides I hope

247
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:54,130
that wasn't too quick any questions

248
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:58,069
seeing none let's let's blast along

249
00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:03,200
alright let's go back to the agenda here

250
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:06,350
briefly oh there we go so now well let's

251
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,220
see I guess we press escape nope maybe

252
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:17,130
it's this yeah all right so then the

253
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:25,419
first first set of slides it's here and

254
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:25,419
[Music]

255
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:38,030
so you can see that oh so now I'm a

256
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:40,699
mortise apin oh yeah I mentioned and I

257
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,579
wanted to quickly mention about as chair

258
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,530
sorry back to chair in the chair I I

259
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,340
wanted to I wanted to quickly mention

260
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:53,030
that we that we had some comments of an

261
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,630
early security Directorate review on the

262
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,050
next generation

263
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,640
and firewall draft the authors have

264
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,650
heard them sort of thinking about

265
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,740
accommodating them and I think that was

266
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:06,040
a good cross area post took a while to

267
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,810
get the comments but Kathleen Moriarty

268
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,290
DISA favor there and completed the

269
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,459
review so we thank you kathleen and well

270
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,400
thank you when we see you again in

271
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,630
person so uh but no other updates there

272
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,670
what we're asking for for

273
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,200
next-generation firewalls people please

274
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,150
read this so we're gonna put this in

275
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,590
last call I think soon we'd like to see

276
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,540
some more reviews on the list it was

277
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,260
generated by a large group of people

278
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,880
much larger than the author list so

279
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,980
that's that's the message

280
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,080
next-generation firewall we're trying to

281
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:41,960
finish that up please read it get ready

282
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:49,160
for last call thank you okay so when

283
00:13:41,960 --> 00:14:07,730
your so I'm gonna take this out if I'm

284
00:13:49,160 --> 00:14:09,199
strong enough x marks the spot okay so

285
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,000
you can see that I'm kind of doing the

286
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:17,810
very economical slide generation now do

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,500
this snip thing on the off the did I do

288
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,329
this

289
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,710
snip thing off the diff and and it's got

290
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,620
all the information everybody wants you

291
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,960
know for a slide title so this is the

292
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,030
this is our updates on back to back

293
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,950
frame benchmarking it's a been a

294
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:36,670
fundamental thing in 2544 and we've got

295
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:41,150
two sets of comments on the list

296
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,550
Maciek and bharat KO ma CX comments were

297
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,590
reflected in the zero zero version but

298
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,449
Morocco's comments came right after I

299
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,430
pushed that working group zero zero

300
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,010
version so I didn't actually get to

301
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,479
those until last night and so we'll talk

302
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,790
about those for a moment

303
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,320
Maciek asked for a couple of things you

304
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,150
know moving some text around that's

305
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,460
great it's done

306
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,610
the goal is measuring ingress buffer

307
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,420
size in front of the header processor

308
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,000
you know there's a picture here that

309
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,339
I'll show you in a moment

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,500
as per the definition so this works if

311
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,509
there's no other buffering add a

312
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,040
paragraph dictating the setup and I

313
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,709
think we've got that kind of got that

314
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,170
cover but we expanded on it a bit so

315
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,459
here's one of the changes likewise in

316
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:30,040
this is in the scope likewise the the

317
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:32,859
methods of RFC 2083 39 which basically

318
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,839
focused on the egress buffer evaluation

319
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,670
should be used for test cases where the

320
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,889
egress port buffer is the known point of

321
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,689
overload we're we're actually talking

322
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,500
about some modifications for that but

323
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:47,290
that's a good thing and then somehow in

324
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:51,069
the working group a 0-0 draft this text

325
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,439
was all deleted and it actually gives it

326
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,329
actually gives our model though the

327
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,310
model is that you know we've got a

328
00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:00,790
traffic generator and ingress ingress to

329
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,878
the DUT there's a buffer in here and and

330
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,399
then the header processing system and

331
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,959
and so if the header processing system

332
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,120
can't keep up with what you're sending

333
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,449
in this buffer grows we try to do that

334
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,189
with a back to back frame burst the

335
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,128
maximum burst we can send in without

336
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:20,259
loss that gives us an implied size of

337
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:22,480
this buffer so it's like a just a very

338
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,829
simple model of the DUT then we aggress

339
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,930
to the receiver and see if we've got

340
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:29,800
zero loss that's basically how this test

341
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,500
works so I actually added all this in

342
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,628
version 5 of the document and I figured

343
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,399
out last night late what what happened I

344
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,980
think I must have grabbed oh for when I

345
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,990
did the zero zero update and that's how

346
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:48,790
this got lost so now it's back in for

347
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:49,029
what it will be in oh one okay okay all

348
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,269
right

349
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:54,819
and Maciek had had a long a final list

350
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:57,069
of comments which listed areas of noise

351
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:59,589
to the measurement which I basically

352
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:01,839
captured here pretty much word-for-word

353
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,150
so we should you know evaluate these

354
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,559
identify them remove them if possible I

355
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,689
mean this is the kind of thing that

356
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,059
could I mean obviously we're using loss

357
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,250
in this measurement to find out whether

358
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:14,918
the buffer size has been reached

359
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,869
resources have been exceeded so if we've

360
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,579
got other sources of loss we want to

361
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,408
chase them away or understand them and

362
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,809
test around them so that's basically

363
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:27,860
what the

364
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:30,350
is all about okay and then we're

365
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,469
mentioning the importance of the Etsy

366
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:36,740
nfe tester zero nine specification which

367
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,899
specifies a search algorithm called

368
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,610
binary search with loss verification

369
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:43,549
that's one of the ways that we can

370
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:46,158
mitigate these these cases where

371
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,980
transient effects in a you know

372
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:51,529
virtualized environment affect the the

373
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,840
device under test and basically it

374
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:57,230
allows the binary search to search twice

375
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,749
at every position or multiple of times

376
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,340
but there's a there's lots of factors

377
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:03,710
there in terms in terms of the trial

378
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,379
duration and so forth to try to avoid

379
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,820
the transients that you get that we used

380
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:09,168
to be able to work around we used to be

381
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,759
able to say okay all the address

382
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,559
learning is done and all the routing

383
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,360
updates are done and now the device is

384
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,830
stable yeah in the virtualized world

385
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,269
that we can't chase away all the

386
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,269
interrupts they're necessary for the

387
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:22,840
health of the device so we've got that

388
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:26,330
in there there's an explicit step in the

389
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,269
in the measurement and I mean that's our

390
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,240
corrected buffer time which is really

391
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:34,149
the the main contribution of this draft

392
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:40,519
we're basically just to go back

393
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:44,029
we're basically figuring out when we

394
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:47,019
send a burst of packets the header

395
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:50,869
processing has handled some of the burst

396
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:54,379
while we're sending them in and so the

397
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:58,399
the size of the burst that we can send

398
00:18:54,379 --> 00:19:02,360
through loss free is is basically the

399
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:04,008
sum of the the size of the buffer aided

400
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,899
by the number of packets that header

401
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,299
processing has been able to pull out and

402
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:11,869
that's determined by the max throughput

403
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:14,389
RFC 2544 throughput of the device so now

404
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:16,220
in that recognition we thought you know

405
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:18,619
this is the correction factor that we

406
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,629
need now for the for the true buffer

407
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:22,668
size calculation and we've got that's

408
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:26,418
the main purpose of putting this Draft

409
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:30,169
together so the broad comments from

410
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,250
verrat Co you know I'm not going to be

411
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,990
able to go through all of these in

412
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,720
detail but they're I plan to address

413
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,240
them in version

414
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,480
one of the one of the points here he

415
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,580
says is that deployers wishing to

416
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,669
predict the time for the buffer to fill

417
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,399
using a real actual rate will be

418
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:51,830
different from the back to back rate

419
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:55,939
that we're pumping in so he's saying we

420
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:58,010
could add this calculation as well it it

421
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,380
will basically come up to a longer

422
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,750
buffer time because this is you're going

423
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,340
to be your actual traffic a question in

424
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,740
my mind though is a tester going to know

425
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,510
this at the time that they're running

426
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,159
this benchmark test and I'm kind of

427
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,529
thinking I'm kind of thinking this might

428
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:19,010
be an appendix topic it's a maybe for me

429
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:23,120
but that but basically we're reporting

430
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,240
the corrected time that's that's that's

431
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,889
supposed to be the most useful thing and

432
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,130
so the question of the working group is

433
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:35,178
do we add this calculation any comments

434
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,070
there mmm people want to think about it

435
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,460
I guess maybe you have a comment yeah so

436
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,250
as a participant Sarah banks participant

437
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,769
I agreed moving it to the appendix that

438
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,899
best is where I would put it I can't

439
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:49,130
think of a real-life example today in

440
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,989
any network in which you know

441
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,850
sustainably what your rate isn't even if

442
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,919
you did it changes every second of the

443
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,139
day so you know to have this here I'm

444
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,690
not sure that it helps and it also sort

445
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:01,399
of deviates from our typical mandate

446
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,929
that in theory we're trying to have

447
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:04,610
apples to apples tests with

448
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,350
repeatability which you again wouldn't

449
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,269
be able to do here yeah let's capture

450
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,219
that this this would not be a benchmark

451
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:12,049
and and it's a and it's a piece of

452
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,490
information that maybe we can tack on at

453
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,850
the end let's see if there's any more

454
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:19,460
support for it and and if not we we

455
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,830
thank of reko for a suggestion but maybe

456
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:26,600
we just don't put it in or any more than

457
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:29,960
an appendix good thank you sir oh yes

458
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,820
Maciek that sounds like you yes it does

459
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,409
how great that you can't hear me and

460
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,840
even recognize me not the machine

461
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:38,480
machines I'm going through and yeah

462
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,820
regarding radical comment

463
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,139
I'm also leaning to what you have

464
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:47,450
suggested and and Sarah supported but on

465
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:51,769
my end I didn't have enough time to

466
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:53,299
we analyze the implications so so I tend

467
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:57,950
to defend to the ps2 what you have

468
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,779
suggested from there on the list and the

469
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,370
other very quick comments thanks very

470
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,100
much for taking to account my comments

471
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,479
and from what you have sent in the

472
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,178
produce for not replying on email but

473
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,450
what you have presented it looks spot-on

474
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:15,610
thanks very much thank you thank you

475
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:18,049
so stay with us Maciek another varrock o

476
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:25,330
suggestion was to change the names of

477
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:27,889
things so we've got let's see here so

478
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,908
we've got the we've got the corrected

479
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:34,399
buffer time and the implied buffer time

480
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:37,159
as the current terms that were you know

481
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:39,678
that we're measuring and those I mean

482
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,110
these are just names but you know they

483
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,880
made sense in this in the in the context

484
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:50,689
of of you know here's what we're doing

485
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:54,559
in BMW G so but vrak o suggests changing

486
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,200
the names renaming the buffer times the

487
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,269
running buffer time and the suspended

488
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,950
buffer time suspended being that the

489
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:07,340
corrected buffer time is really all you

490
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:11,450
have if suddenly the processor that

491
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,699
header processor stops and so that's

492
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:18,789
instead of a implied or correct or

493
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,789
corrected any of any opinions on this

494
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:26,090
I'm I'm kind of partial to the original

495
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,090
ones but you know I'm done speaking as

496
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,949
the author and and and as a and as a

497
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,459
person who's working from kind of the

498
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,630
original version of the specification

499
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,909
maybe you know maybe maybe maybe we can

500
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:45,639
incorporate those terms in the in the

501
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:48,679
word definitions of these of these

502
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:51,949
variables so Sarah banks again this

503
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,679
participant I to share your opinion I

504
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,169
don't see an overwhelming reason to

505
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,919
upend terminology we've had in 25 44

506
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,019
forever

507
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,100
so one we could take it to the list and

508
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,010
see of other folks

509
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,080
opinions or Rocco could expand and and

510
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,120
help me understand why you'd want to but

511
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,649
based on what I'm seeing here I don't I

512
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,850
don't see a reason to support that yeah

513
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,910
no matter no matter what you'd have to

514
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,320
define you'd have to define any term and

515
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:20,090
I think we've got definitions for the

516
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,168
terms we used so it's it's a suggestion

517
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,970
we have to think about it some more

518
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:31,549
Thank You ver echo ah let's see I'm

519
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:33,940
taking up a lot of time here the verrat

520
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:39,049
Co had sort of an interesting

521
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:44,409
conversation with he examines the pluses

522
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,408
and minuses here of using different

523
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:52,580
parameters in the formula this formula

524
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:55,460
instead of the instead of the maximum

525
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,770
theoretical frame rate he thought maybe

526
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:02,799
we should use the maximum frame rate

527
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:05,000
without loss or the maximum offered load

528
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:11,179
I've got it on the other slide here

529
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,159
which comes from RFC 2889 the maximum of

530
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,559
the frame rate at maximum offered load

531
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,780
so you put the maximum offer to load in

532
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,629
on the on the sort of the wired

533
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,399
interfaces and whatever comes out that's

534
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,570
this frame rate that's what he was

535
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,200
suggesting you might want to

536
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,000
characterize it there but he also says

537
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,130
not sure about how much tension said

538
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,080
other such quantities should get in the

539
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,480
draft and as throughput has the

540
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,720
advantage of avoiding some frame sizes

541
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,490
in the in the testing so yeah I think we

542
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,080
need some contributions experiments to

543
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,700
show the value of this change I think

544
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:50,539
that's a good way forward so well we'll

545
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:53,990
wait to see what happens there and then

546
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:58,340
device device under test versus system

547
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:05,419
under test it's related to the section

548
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:06,770
four prerequisites so there's sources of

549
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:08,510
packet loss that are unrelated to

550
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,520
consistent evaluation the buffer size

551
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,559
they should be identified or mitigated

552
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,120
this material was just added that was

553
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:19,590
something Bracco was questioning

554
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,040
and do we have a separate document

555
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,570
discussing the difference between

556
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,559
testing the device under test and the

557
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,300
system under test

558
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,960
Braca thinks we should have such a

559
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:33,270
document okay but usually feretto

560
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,670
prepares prefers testing the system

561
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,460
under test meaning no extra mitigations

562
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,620
but in this case for the analysis of the

563
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,570
of the three four four mentioned

564
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,070
scenarios to work correctly we need to

565
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,559
make reasonably sure the processor is

566
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,450
not going to get suspended so I mean he

567
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,160
says also agree that the average of the

568
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,770
binary search for the lost clarification

569
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,530
is more realistic process two for the

570
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,270
raid estimate so I think back-to-back

571
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,220
benchmarking for a single DUT retains

572
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,580
the needed simplicity here at least for

573
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,020
the scope of this draft and if the

574
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:10,020
working group has any other opinions

575
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:12,030
about that let us know all right so next

576
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,520
steps continue the discussion we got

577
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,830
some opens here and address them

578
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,720
remaining comments no.1 try to target a

579
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:24,960
working group last call at our next

580
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:31,320
meeting in 106 that has the eliminating

581
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:38,220
noise from magic I think it's this one

582
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:39,540
isn't it no no yes okay so as the person

583
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,940
who will probably take this through

584
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,580
working group last call my ass to the

585
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,470
working group is 25:44 in my mind is a

586
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,928
big deal and if we're gonna update an

587
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,970
account for this I think that having our

588
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:52,440
eyeballs on it as a working group and

589
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,330
our feedback collectively is really

590
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,890
important on these things because it

591
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,649
matters and physical and I think it

592
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,670
could matter more and virtual so I want

593
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,610
to make sure if we're gonna go ahead and

594
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:05,190
update 2544 that we not just a couple of

595
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:07,530
us but a good majority of us have and

596
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,870
give out lots of input either yes we

597
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,460
agree or no we don't and here's why but

598
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,050
my asked to you guys especially if we're

599
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,090
gonna try to working group last call in

600
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,480
Singapore is that we take a look at that

601
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,189
so please read this draft even if the

602
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,020
only thing you focus on specifically is

603
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,700
are these specific things I know al

604
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,170
wants us to focus on everything we

605
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,480
should oh that's why I put it up here

606
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,110
but if the only thing you have time or

607
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,669
in your

608
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,229
your day is to go ahead and address

609
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:32,039
these these are these could be

610
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,600
contentious

611
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,640
so getting everybody's eyeballs would be

612
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,120
I think helpful to the community as a

613
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,220
whole

614
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,110
yeah every one of us tests it's

615
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,179
important thank you thank you sir

616
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:49,709
so yeah specifically this is an update

617
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:50,789
226 Section 226 point 4 of RFC 2544 if

618
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,080
you haven't read

619
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:58,379
25:44 read it at least that far and then

620
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,090
and then jump into this draft and you'll

621
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,720
see some of the reasons why this is a

622
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,059
good update it's a generally much larger

623
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,340
expansion of the procedure that's there

624
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,340
so good thank you for your attention

625
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:31,559
yeah they're all in order so you can

626
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,510
just go down to the next one I think

627
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,830
we've got that one up actually ooh

628
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,830
was that a PowerPoint

629
00:29:53,609 --> 00:30:01,539
yeah good so it sounds like it sounds

630
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:03,639
like you're ready to do I see Bracco on

631
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:05,200
the on the list there too so who which

632
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:13,089
of you two is gonna give the the

633
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:13,629
presentation here Roscoe yes me Maciek

634
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:16,599
okay

635
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:18,820
Oh Moscow so you got your first slide up

636
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,979
I hope you can see it

637
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,939
please start and try to keep it to 10

638
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:26,259
minutes if you can thank you

639
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,179
actually it's a radical presenting but

640
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,789
his audio is coming through very quiet

641
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:35,169
so all you need to speak up okay can you

642
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:38,469
hear me yes now we can thank you so hi

643
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:41,849
everyone I'm Rocco the person who

644
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:45,129
commented on the previous draft and I

645
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:49,239
will be talking about so-called research

646
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:57,059
it is new search algorithm and let's go

647
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:59,859
to the next slide so these are

648
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:04,269
descriptions of what has changed from

649
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:09,099
the previous draft the mostly said minor

650
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:13,029
fixes most of this presentation is the

651
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:17,889
same as we had the previous meeting so

652
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:22,599
let's go to the next slide so here is

653
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:25,080
the motivation and so the main point of

654
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:27,899
a pillar search is that it is

655
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:32,439
probabilistic search probabilistic

656
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:34,779
algorithm so it is suitable for cases

657
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,839
when the device under test or system

658
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:40,809
under test is not consistent enough

659
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:42,820
typical example is that you perform one

660
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:44,918
trial measurement you see zero was but

661
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,218
then you repeat the measurement and you

662
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,879
see non zero may be quite big close so

663
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:54,149
this is problem for traditional data

664
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:58,089
mystic algorithms and tabular search is

665
00:31:54,149 --> 00:32:01,370
one class of algorithms that attempts to

666
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:09,040
deal with this issue

667
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:12,709
that's next like this so the overview

668
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:16,070
the one important thing for our search

669
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:20,240
is that it is not suitable for finding

670
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:22,310
throughput as defined in RFC two five

671
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,920
four four because that the definition

672
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:28,879
says that if it is throughput you should

673
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:31,940
see no was and this is very hard to

674
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,500
prove when your system is not the

675
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:39,170
domestic enough so to make things really

676
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,600
easier for the algorithm instead we

677
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:48,740
defined so called critical load which is

678
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:53,689
expected average of loss ratio over

679
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:56,690
multiple measurements so typically you

680
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,850
choose this parameter to be nonzero but

681
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,430
very small let's say ten to the minus

682
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:04,189
seven which means out of ten million

683
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:08,600
packages that you sent you accept only

684
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:11,060
one on average be missing so when you

685
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:15,320
give this go to the algorithm it is

686
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,060
easier for the algorithm to give both

687
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,000
upper bounds and lower bounds so that

688
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:24,770
you can pinpoint to this critical load

689
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,040
more and achieve better result next

690
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,040
slide please

691
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:44,139
so there are some differences and one

692
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:47,090
typical think is that there are multiple

693
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:51,260
probabilistic let's call them models

694
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:54,889
that can model your device and usually

695
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:59,120
they range from very simple to more

696
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:05,140
realistic but very hard to implement so

697
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:10,370
our search is tending to let's call it

698
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:14,369
simple models but still not broken

699
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:18,929
enough so that the results are

700
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:21,379
reliable and we know that today neural

701
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:26,989
networks and machine learning and

702
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:29,819
methods like that can give you very good

703
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:32,249
information about your system but they

704
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:35,279
are not deterministic enough that means

705
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:39,808
that if you get a slightly different

706
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:44,639
data the resulting suggestion can be

707
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:46,409
different and other people trying to get

708
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,319
the same results will get different

709
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:51,659
results so it is a useful matter not

710
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:56,609
stable enough so that's why we are

711
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:59,779
sticking to to prove on statistical

712
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:03,450
methods next slide please

713
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:07,140
and this slide is new compared to the

714
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:11,549
presentation the last meeting there are

715
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:17,219
some interesting observations one

716
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:21,930
observation is that sometimes the system

717
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:24,960
under test shows behavior that depends

718
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,288
on time for example the throughput is

719
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,089
getting lower and lower because

720
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:35,039
something is leaking or things like that

721
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:38,249
we are arguing that beyond our search

722
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:42,989
results are better even in this case

723
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:46,288
compared to standard binary search but

724
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:48,479
yeah of course this is a not thing to be

725
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:52,640
written in the draft this is just a side

726
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:58,129
comments that we have done some

727
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:03,239
measurements on it and we are satisfied

728
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:05,819
where we see the results and yeah there

729
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,979
are some comments about how does it look

730
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:11,940
like when the results are not that good

731
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:21,808
but that's easier to show to you so next

732
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:24,660
slide next slide please yeah these are

733
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:27,090
the graphs for the fitting functions

734
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:30,950
there are two approximations

735
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:35,270
let the algorithm uses to make decisions

736
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:38,939
the thing is that the algorithm chooses

737
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:42,120
different offer loads and most of the

738
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:45,750
time the transient overload is not the

739
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,569
final critical order that this is search

740
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,710
for so the algorithm has to make some

741
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:55,170
reasoning about what does it mean when I

742
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,570
measured too high or too low how does it

743
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:03,120
translate so these questions are used

744
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:06,270
for that you will see graphs of them for

745
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:10,160
a particular set of parameters that are

746
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:15,030
there to show that in absolute values

747
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:18,770
the blue one looks that it is smaller

748
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:21,930
but when you look at the logarithm

749
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:24,960
academic values you see that for very

750
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:29,879
small offer loads actually the orange

751
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,620
one gives smaller predictions next slide

752
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,810
please

753
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:38,720
and this is the example of what the

754
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:44,100
results look like

755
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:47,370
of course this result is just a

756
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:50,009
description let's say debug output of

757
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,380
the algorithm the algorithm in fact only

758
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,170
outputs two numbers upper bound and

759
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,380
lower bound there will be the numbers

760
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:02,390
from the far right this is just to show

761
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,780
you the how the algorithm changes its

762
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:10,830
evaluation over time and when you see

763
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:14,040
the y-axis if you see the small numbers

764
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:16,620
this is very precise so upper bound and

765
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,470
lower bound is very close together and

766
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,859
this is how we realize that our system

767
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:24,899
of the test does not have exactly

768
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,480
constant performance but it is very

769
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,930
slightly coming down so this is to show

770
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,980
that we are search even if it is

771
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:36,660
probably stick and then it can give you

772
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,210
besides enough an output if the system

773
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:43,890
behaves well enough

774
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:49,819
next slide please and this is a let's

775
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:54,299
say average case the gray dots show the

776
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:57,509
improved selection of offered load this

777
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,970
is the case when most of the results

778
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:02,750
give you zero loss but sometimes you

779
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:07,558
give nonzero and quite a bit close and

780
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:13,410
you can see that the algorithm is trying

781
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:15,180
to measure at the values that can give

782
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:19,049
it with some probability nonzero loss

783
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,529
even if the actual estimates are way

784
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:26,220
below it because we find out that this

785
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:30,480
way of choosing overloads can give you

786
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:35,490
better convergence and this also shows

787
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:41,280
you that the occasional big loss is seen

788
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:49,558
to affect the estimates and you can over

789
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:51,480
time get worse estimated in in so that

790
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,280
the upper bound and lower bound is far

791
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,609
apart than it was previously

792
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:02,240
but it is what the algorithm should give

793
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:05,549
you it's just a consequence of very

794
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,089
surprising data point appearing so this

795
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:12,329
is the this is how most of the test we

796
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:14,359
are performing look like next slide

797
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:18,299
please

798
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:20,339
and this is the example where the

799
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:22,859
algorithm is doing basically the same

800
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:26,930
thing but the upper and lower bounds are

801
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:29,819
not converging together very well I

802
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:34,290
believe this is a still something that

803
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:37,670
we can improve on so the algorithm is

804
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:41,190
not finished and we written in stone but

805
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:44,280
this is the currently best way we have

806
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:47,069
when once again system behaves in a way

807
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,650
that most of the results are zero loss

808
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,380
but when no zero loss happens it is

809
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:56,820
quite large

810
00:40:51,380 --> 00:41:01,590
looks like this okay so here are the

811
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:03,690
links so there is FD io open-source

812
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:07,760
project and we are sub project called

813
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:15,410
CSIT and - we are using this algorithm

814
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:18,120
to show the behavior but it is a steal

815
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:22,080
let's call it experimental we are not

816
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:25,109
running those tests for every scenario

817
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:28,500
we have we are still using a

818
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:32,340
deterministic test for most of them but

819
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,120
when we are more confident about this

820
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,980
PLA search I believe we can switch back

821
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:42,089
basically we just need more data to

822
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:46,890
confirm that PL our search one long run

823
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:49,410
let's say 30 minutes gives stable enough

824
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:53,069
results so that we can replace the

825
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:58,040
currently used 10 runs of data mystic

826
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,040
algorithm next slide please

827
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:04,589
okay here are some implementation

828
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:07,050
specifics but looking at the time there

829
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:09,140
is no time to go into that so next slide

830
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,140
please

831
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,190
next slide please

832
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:26,460
okay so this is the important thing so a

833
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:30,589
side of our part implementing small

834
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:34,020
improvements we are let's say stuck

835
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:39,780
that's the adoption point of view

836
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:45,390
because we didn't get let's say any

837
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:48,390
reviews and we know that the syntactic

838
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:52,080
and terminology in parts of our drafts

839
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:53,759
are not very good maybe that's the

840
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:59,520
reason that people do not want to review

841
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:02,820
it but anyway to move forward to receive

842
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,040
adoption we would like any ideas what we

843
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:08,010
on our site

844
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,859
should do could do so that it is easier

845
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:17,100
for the working group as a whole to

846
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:21,840
adapt and improve what is written in the

847
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:23,700
draft good thank you for echo are there

848
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,560
are there any comments in the room here

849
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:30,240
is anybody first off is anybody read the

850
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:34,500
draft so just the chairs have looked at

851
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,290
it and one point for echo is we had a

852
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,430
special session on the data analysis

853
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:43,470
last time we gave each other a chance to

854
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:46,020
you know present their data in detail

855
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,029
and asked a lot of questions there was

856
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,790
got a good feedback from Carsten and me

857
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,470
and other people in the room I'm

858
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:57,509
wondering if you're able to take action

859
00:43:52,470 --> 00:44:00,720
on any of that feedback well most of the

860
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:04,470
feedback was related to badly behaved

861
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,379
the system under test and we were lucky

862
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:11,879
enough that our system of the tester has

863
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:14,430
improved so we do not we no longer have

864
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,060
the source of a badly behaved sut so

865
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:21,060
most of the improvements were not used

866
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:29,759
okay but I think some of them still

867
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:31,440
could be used just yeah let's say so

868
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,590
maybe in the future we can scale we can

869
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,150
schedule a discussion that includes you

870
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,150
know some more data that gets people's

871
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:45,450
ideas flowing and I mean the you know

872
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,030
the the theory behind this seems fairly

873
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:51,299
solid but we need the reviews like you

874
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:59,550
said so are there any volunteers to

875
00:44:51,300 --> 00:45:04,560
review the draft I guess okay one Tim

876
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:10,680
from UNH will will review the draft

877
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:15,240
that's good thank you Tim and we'll get

878
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:18,450
guys in touch thank you very much all

879
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,080
right so with with getting one reviewer

880
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,379
here

881
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,100
reco I think and of course I'll take a

882
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,200
look at it too

883
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,420
I think some of my comments on on the

884
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,649
mor draft are probably applicable to

885
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,390
your draft as well so a police try to

886
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,900
take advantage of those in the in the

887
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:38,160
next revision and and I think well I

888
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:45,630
think we'll close it there thank you

889
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:47,759
very much yes thank you okay so we the

890
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:52,200
chairs realized we jumped right over an

891
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,000
important topic which was item 1a on our

892
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,490
on our agenda

893
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,830
it's the benchmarking methodology for

894
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:03,540
evpn and PBB evpn this is just a working

895
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,580
group last called determination that's

896
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,890
what it sort of says on our agenda and

897
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,440
that's what we're going to do right now

898
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:13,350
[Music]

899
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,260
since Sarah kind of bound a draft that

900
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:18,150
I'm working on in with this topic it

901
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,560
ended up now that that she's got to make

902
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,810
the call so this is why we have

903
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:25,049
co-chairs somebody can be working

904
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:27,540
somebody can be calling consensus so the

905
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,030
last meeting in on list I asked the

906
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,040
authors to we had several drafts for

907
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,740
evpn and I asked the authors to sit down

908
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,060
talk together and figure out whether or

909
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,370
not these should be one draft or

910
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,259
multiple drafts the authors did that

911
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,750
suit into that action item very

912
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,000
seriously and I'm happy to report that

913
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,040
the authors have had that discussion and

914
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,210
that they mutually reached the consensus

915
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,070
that the works while related can happen

916
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:55,800
in parallel to one another particularly

917
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:57,180
where one draft is about to go through

918
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,700
where I'm going to call consensus for

919
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,279
working verb last call on the list so

920
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,230
that's the formal decision I really

921
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,060
appreciate that you guys sat down spent

922
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,220
the time during your day jobs to do this

923
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,350
particularly what the time zone changes

924
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,359
for you guys as well so thank you for

925
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:14,460
doing that I think as a working group

926
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,990
that makes sense if that doesn't make

927
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,540
sense to anybody in the room please let

928
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:20,609
me know but basically they're covering

929
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,380
two different pieces where as a tester

930
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,940
if I was going to test this I would

931
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,640
ultimately use both arcs

932
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,040
these or drafts when they're in the

933
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,420
meantime it's just ones ahead of the

934
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,520
other and we don't see a reason to slow

935
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,770
one down for the other so that's the

936
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,330
decision we're making or I'm I guess I'm

937
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,610
going to call on the list and give you

938
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:43,009
guys a chance to jump up and down if we

939
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:46,560
need to thank you thank you both thank

940
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:49,110
you both sitting and Jim Jim Yutaro who

941
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,549
did a lot of the email discussions and

942
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:57,750
and set up the sort of agreed to the

943
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:59,510
time we did this at 7:00 a.m. but it was

944
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:05,430
a really good discussion thanks again

945
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:11,730
all right so our next topic is the the

946
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:14,120
multiple level search and that's going

947
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:16,680
to be presented by Maciek I'm sure and

948
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,660
so Maciek we heard you very clearly

949
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:39,600
before so let's make sure we can still

950
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:39,960
do that and I don't see Maciek oh here

951
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:48,480
he comes

952
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:52,350
okay yes we got you now

953
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:57,210
okay sorry I got thrown from the program

954
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:59,549
from the room because reconnect so I

955
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:03,480
will I know that the connection I'm

956
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:07,380
presenting from Paris so if any point on

957
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,820
my audio which not coming I know Lauren

958
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,880
so from me Decker is everything only

959
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,560
Turing it but if it's choppy just let me

960
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,240
know I will scroll down and disable the

961
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:22,620
video and so this is about the the LR

962
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:26,069
search and protocol of ratio search &

963
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:31,850
Brasco and logic sampler which are the

964
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:34,829
the office and they slightly okay and so

965
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:38,299
we presented the

966
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:41,999
draft on the last meeting in Prague and

967
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:46,529
here are the main changes from version 0

968
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:48,779
1 to 2 0 to the I think the main ones

969
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:51,719
related to the ml are search

970
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:52,829
applicability and usability and I'm

971
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:57,170
going to cover some of these on the

972
00:49:52,829 --> 00:50:00,569
flowing slides and we also greatly

973
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:03,660
updated the terminology section just in

974
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:05,579
case there are terms that we were using

975
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:10,368
this with a slightly different different

976
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:13,589
meaning and and we have also updated as

977
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:15,809
references to the to the FDA assisted

978
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:17,880
recommendation and we also added the

979
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:26,150
security considerations where next slide

980
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:29,400
please so ml our search is it's about

981
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:31,199
discovering performance at like a

982
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,699
throughput rates in a single search but

983
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:38,339
instead of looking and searching for a

984
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:42,119
single ratio a single rate it its aim is

985
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:44,249
to find multiple rates and and they are

986
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,779
distinguished with you know the the

987
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:52,109
configured packets loss ratio and we

988
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:53,729
were using it apparently to today from

989
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:56,759
the implementation perspective and go

990
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:59,698
the code that is running in energy or

991
00:50:56,759 --> 00:51:02,459
system is also available as a as a pipe

992
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:04,319
I library to find two rates the the

993
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:07,428
number of grades which is a zero packet

994
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:09,869
loss as per RFC two five four four and

995
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:12,420
and the other weight is a partial drop

996
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:15,479
right with where Pilar that the packet

997
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,479
loss ratio is higher than zero so it's a

998
00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:22,589
non zero and and we're using it really

999
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:26,519
for nav benchmarking to see how close

1000
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:29,009
the two are to to each other and for you

1001
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:31,109
know a below add your blank box and s UT

1002
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:32,939
and UT evaluation purposes if they are

1003
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:35,339
close to each other this means that the

1004
00:51:32,939 --> 00:51:38,459
jitter plays a very low

1005
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:41,489
role in packet loss if they quite far

1006
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:43,469
apart and that means that a jitter

1007
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:45,029
related to you know how the software is

1008
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:47,099
executed no matter how the packets are

1009
00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:47,440
are being drained from the from the

1010
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:51,210
queue

1011
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,130
process and I place a much bigger role

1012
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,410
so he's running separate binary searches

1013
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,540
for nd rddr

1014
00:51:55,410 --> 00:52:05,379
Iran a single search or one runs a

1015
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:08,110
single search and next slide so why why

1016
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,780
is this useful and applicable well it

1017
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:15,910
reduces the amount of searches you do i

1018
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:18,270
or one does and the aim is also to to

1019
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:22,870
reduce the overall execution time

1020
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:26,380
required to find those rates and we then

1021
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:28,990
I propose another way to reduce the

1022
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,150
execution time further by using shorter

1023
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,549
trial durations to start with for

1024
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,560
intermediate steps and and using the

1025
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,630
finally specified final duration and

1026
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,180
just for the final four the final

1027
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:41,980
measurements and from that perspective I

1028
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,960
would believe the canal our search is

1029
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,360
compatible with RFC two five four four

1030
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:52,690
in the context of of zero packet loss

1031
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:54,490
and write this found excite so in terms

1032
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,920
of sample implementations this is the

1033
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:59,319
same slide we showed last time that's

1034
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,320
where the the code lives a current code

1035
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,200
lives in the Linux Foundation networking

1036
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:10,210
FDA insisted project there is also a

1037
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:14,950
pipeline package as as listed and it is

1038
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:17,950
being tried also by the ENFP bench the

1039
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:21,250
open V also in its foundation networking

1040
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:23,620
open a project or sub project and for

1041
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:27,640
for exactly the first purpose finding

1042
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:34,420
the Indians and PBR writes a Finals

1043
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:38,319
length so we have received the reviews

1044
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:41,980
from from Alec Odom who is a little in

1045
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:45,300
the debate from Oakland V and maybe they

1046
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:48,250
are attracting in Garrett so they're in

1047
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,380
in the public but not on the BMW BMW

1048
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,040
gene list and so we would like to

1049
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:54,670
welcome

1050
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:57,850
reduce from the benchmarking working

1051
00:53:54,670 --> 00:54:01,570
group and and similar to you know what

1052
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:04,900
Rothko's saying we would like to

1053
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:08,710
to draw to to make the draft adopted by

1054
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:10,480
BMW G and to make it a BMW BMW G world

1055
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,730
of Zartha versus the current and aimed

1056
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,210
and draft would like to understand the

1057
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:19,210
the exact steps required for for this

1058
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:25,540
work to to become a working report thank

1059
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:27,940
you thank you Massey yet so any

1060
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:33,130
questions or comments on on the draft

1061
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:36,640
who's read the draft that's here several

1062
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:42,700
hands okay so um any any questions on

1063
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:45,190
updates the things like that one one

1064
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:49,540
thing I wanted to talk about Maciek is

1065
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:53,290
the this Garrett where you're where

1066
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,910
you're tracking the the changes I guess

1067
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:58,090
I kind of I kind of forgot about that

1068
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,890
from your last presentation so I sent

1069
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,740
comments to the list but I think we've

1070
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,060
got to keep you know every working group

1071
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:10,299
is trying to strike a balance between

1072
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:13,779
the you know the developer tools and the

1073
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:19,060
mailing lists of a volt we're kind of

1074
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:21,070
stuck old so for now but but look that's

1075
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:24,850
I mean that's something that we can sort

1076
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:26,650
of begin to mix here a bit maybe we can

1077
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:30,490
I mean I did first off I didn't get an

1078
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:31,780
email from Garret to say that you know

1079
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,160
that you would address any comments

1080
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:36,850
there or anything like that I'm not sure

1081
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:41,680
whether I've got to do something to get

1082
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:43,870
my my credentials in the cset maybe

1083
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,950
maybe this is part of the cset Garrett

1084
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:47,470
is that where is that where you're

1085
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,200
dealing this dealing with this in the I

1086
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,759
don't know in the repo space there I

1087
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,180
don't have the link in front of me it's

1088
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,530
it's what is required is electronic

1089
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,730
credential surveillance foundation

1090
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:01,330
that's it

1091
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:03,790
all right so my my Linux Foundation user

1092
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:06,370
ID is ACM you should be able to add me

1093
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:11,050
there and and and that'll get me to an

1094
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:13,750
address get my time so no I think he's

1095
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,770
required it's just it's just the link so

1096
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,700
we indeed

1097
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:20,950
we did not see or your comments I sent

1098
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:26,049
updates with it with it with a Garrett

1099
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:28,839
link to the list I think after the crack

1100
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:31,300
ITF and also once we get Alec comments

1101
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:35,770
before we published the the updated

1102
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:38,800
version but I think I you know I I agree

1103
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:41,259
with with with your comments in the sort

1104
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:44,980
of stuck between the the old and the new

1105
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:47,920
I think it should be a responsibility of

1106
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:50,470
the of the offers to to keep connecting

1107
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,980
the two platforms or whatever whatever

1108
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:55,720
is being used so I think realizing it

1109
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,330
now because you know I work on Garrett

1110
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,609
all the time and for me it comes and

1111
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:03,910
naturally is that's where we operate but

1112
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:06,010
you know Garrett or or difficult but it

1113
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:09,339
probably is good it should be a good a

1114
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:12,310
good practice to rely comments including

1115
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:16,060
the interactive comments between the two

1116
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:18,250
and mailing lists is you know it's a

1117
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:22,540
platform for for that so all that good

1118
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:25,570
comment and and and so from now on any

1119
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:29,140
Garrett comment exchange we will will

1120
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:31,570
arrive through the list yeah yeah I sent

1121
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,310
I sent the comments last Monday if you I

1122
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:35,590
thought I heard you say that you hadn't

1123
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:37,750
seen them that that's probably because

1124
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,960
maybe because I've been trying to oh

1125
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:43,750
okay all last week and this week so I

1126
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,730
will search for them very good

1127
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:49,120
they're there on the list and the date

1128
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:52,210
you want is the 15th good okay and I can

1129
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,690
see them though alright great okay great

1130
00:57:52,210 --> 00:58:06,190
okay so can we get some volunteer

1131
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:07,760
reviewers for this draft yes come to the

1132
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:11,400
mic and say your name that will help

1133
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,400
[Laughter]

1134
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,450
okay yeah

1135
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,860
even add it in the ether pad if you

1136
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,810
can't that'll be great thank you

1137
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:32,590
so we've got one volunteer reviewer

1138
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:35,200
for you Maciek Excellus good thanks and

1139
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:39,610
I'll continue going through it as well

1140
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,660
good thanks very much okay all right all

1141
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:41,370
right thanks for your presentation more

1142
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,680
questions

1143
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:45,970
pardon thank you yeah that's fine thank

1144
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,450
you so we'll see we'll see you again

1145
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:58,779
later try not to let the meeting kick

1146
00:58:49,450 --> 00:59:03,279
you out I will do my best thank you okay

1147
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:05,890
so our next topic is the considerations

1148
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:12,250
for benchmarking network performance and

1149
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:14,830
containerized infrastructures welcome to

1150
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:19,410
your first BMW Jie presentation here I

1151
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:22,150
think it's a

1152
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:27,810
yunsik yang right yeah yeah very good

1153
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:27,810
welcome how to stand on the X thank you

1154
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:34,630
hello everybody I am hearing young from

1155
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:37,419
some University in South Korea today I

1156
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:39,850
just want to talk about updating our

1157
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,730
draft consideration for benchmarking

1158
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:49,690
network performance in the container

1159
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:52,510
containerized infrastructures so we

1160
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:55,060
submitted this draft last last ITF and

1161
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:57,520
then the many many people leave you our

1162
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,009
draft thank you and then thank you for a

1163
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:05,800
special thank you for all the name on

1164
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:08,200
the wrist so we we couldn't we couldn't

1165
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,760
applied all of the comment to the our

1166
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:15,939
the current current draft but we try to

1167
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:19,410
adjust the information your your review

1168
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,410
to the our new draft

1169
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:27,340
so actually last time when you think

1170
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:32,440
about that this disrupt with we thought

1171
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:39,030
that the industry just provides some

1172
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:40,460
factor which he which led to the current

1173
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,050
they talk

1174
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:45,560
proper ones in the continuous

1175
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:48,620
infrastructure but so we we just

1176
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,900
restocked so many factors on the

1177
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:55,250
additional consideration part and the

1178
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:58,760
testing but we I think is in we need

1179
01:00:55,250 --> 01:01:00,920
provide more detailed in the industry

1180
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,570
after so we added a surah chapter the

1181
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,520
one is the container networking

1182
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:06,500
classification and resource

1183
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,950
consideration and the pinchy Maki Sonya

1184
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:12,620
for the container is infrastructure so

1185
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:14,899
among the DS scepters so we categorize

1186
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:17,089
the container networking technology and

1187
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,010
then we also try to describe the

1188
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:22,010
different resource utilization suffers

1189
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:24,590
between p.m. based and the containers

1190
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:27,410
infrastructure and we are so drawing the

1191
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:29,420
more figure to clearly figure out that

1192
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,970
what is the difference between the VM

1193
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,970
and the container and then we also added

1194
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:40,939
a new test scenario for the container

1195
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:42,430
infrastructure to so the first update

1196
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,700
part is continually talking

1197
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:49,480
classification so in in this chapter we

1198
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:52,939
just classified the container at talking

1199
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:56,060
with the three data model out of the

1200
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:58,820
canal space and user space and then in

1201
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,860
the user space we also classified the

1202
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:03,500
device pasture and the p-switch model

1203
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:05,690
and then we also mapped current in there

1204
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,790
talking a containerized networking

1205
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:11,170
technology to this this classification

1206
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:17,860
so we add the ten reference with a death

1207
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:21,890
model so yeah and then in the resource

1208
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:26,330
consideration part of we just risked up

1209
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:28,279
to three things for for the continuance

1210
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:32,870
truck sure so so when you think about

1211
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:37,120
that this factor we just we just think

1212
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:41,480
about how we want what vector should

1213
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:44,420
attack to affect the containerized

1214
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,040
infrastructure so so the what is the

1215
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:48,050
difference between the BM and the

1216
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,060
Container infrastructure so we just

1217
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:52,700
figure out three but we were adding more

1218
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:54,040
the next time but the first one is a

1219
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,770
huge page

1220
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,460
actually in the VM we can use the huge

1221
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:02,170
Pacey but basically we can't we should

1222
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,270
given the resource and it's the one

1223
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:08,410
gigabyte for the huger pages but in the

1224
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:12,070
container infrastructure we can adjust

1225
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:16,660
more granularly so I think we think that

1226
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:18,750
we thought that maybe it will affect the

1227
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:22,868
container at talking performance and

1228
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:25,810
Douma the like duma or so we considered

1229
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:30,910
for the resource consideration actually

1230
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:33,580
duma is a non-deterministic and the when

1231
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:38,109
when he when installation in insulate of

1232
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:40,960
the syrian app the the there may be

1233
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:45,279
resources non theta mystic and the doom

1234
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:49,150
are so known agonistic so maybe we

1235
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:52,600
cannot figure out the exact exact the

1236
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:56,200
pokemons relationship between duma and

1237
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:59,160
the networking but we we will figure out

1238
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:04,990
and then we describe about iterator and

1239
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:09,009
RX TX multi cue or so actually in the

1240
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:13,270
when we test the networking pokemons in

1241
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:15,420
the game in prob RX TX multi cure so we

1242
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:19,840
consider the but in the container now

1243
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:24,000
maybe is not supported but maybe it also

1244
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:30,340
one of the factor to affect the the

1245
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,260
container at talking performance and in

1246
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:35,910
the benchmarking scenario for the

1247
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:39,250
container infrastructure so basically

1248
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:42,009
according to the GTS design document

1249
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,170
they their to scenario the one is the

1250
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:46,900
container to container and another one

1251
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:50,050
is pot pot but in this raft we are we

1252
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:54,119
requested the more to scenario one is

1253
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:58,240
the BMP another one is the BMP because

1254
01:04:54,119 --> 01:05:01,480
when we implant when we implemented the

1255
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,060
container infrastructure in the real

1256
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:07,869
environment we were so maybe we can

1257
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:11,769
deploy the pod on the VM so

1258
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:14,799
so considered that scenario so in this

1259
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:17,828
trip in the current draft we added a two

1260
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:25,029
additional test scenario and LV also

1261
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:28,240
wrote the figure and yeah and then the

1262
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:33,009
last time when he had a meeting in the

1263
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:37,899
last meeting so many people also comment

1264
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:41,529
about our draft and then yeah the one of

1265
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:46,299
the comment is we should consider the

1266
01:05:41,529 --> 01:05:50,109
operational consideration so maybe we

1267
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:52,720
didn't we couldn't add the concrete

1268
01:05:50,109 --> 01:05:54,490
information about the operational

1269
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,788
consideration but when you think about

1270
01:05:54,490 --> 01:06:02,288
the real service in the in the container

1271
01:05:57,789 --> 01:06:05,380
as infrastructure maybe just we think

1272
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:07,599
about the only one vnf way which is

1273
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:11,920
based on this I mean made by this

1274
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:16,029
container is not enough so like the

1275
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:20,680
district the substance is wrapped we are

1276
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:22,450
so considered the how we how we measure

1277
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:27,009
the performance in the container is

1278
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:31,328
infrastructure so we also considered

1279
01:06:27,009 --> 01:06:34,900
that part two and then the next step

1280
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:36,970
maybe we will update about our draft or

1281
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:39,609
game because we have some typo so we

1282
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:44,499
will update soon and then any feedback

1283
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:47,650
welcome and then we are so actually we

1284
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:51,578
also try to add the more currently new

1285
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:56,710
technology in added to into the district

1286
01:06:51,579 --> 01:07:02,829
and then we also think about the

1287
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:05,609
hackathon in the ITF because because we

1288
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:08,170
now we just classify the networking

1289
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:10,690
they're talking problem and then a

1290
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:13,630
networking model and then they think

1291
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:15,940
about just factors but we also proved

1292
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:19,690
that concept and that we just want to

1293
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:21,009
discuss with a VM working groups members

1294
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:23,900
so

1295
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:27,170
we don't have the specific plan about it

1296
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:31,130
but if you have interesting in the hecka

1297
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:39,739
song please ask me and ask to other

1298
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:45,380
members thank you so I'm written as a

1299
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:47,589
participant I saw in your in your slides

1300
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:51,769
that you're dealing with an Ummah

1301
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:54,739
agnostic yeah a situation here for for

1302
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:57,558
deployment and that has a big impact on

1303
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:59,930
performance yeah I was going to just

1304
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:03,109
gonna refer to you refer you to the

1305
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:06,558
testing we did not in the container

1306
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:09,680
world but in the hypervisor vm world as

1307
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:13,130
part of OPN fe yes the villa's perf

1308
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:15,979
project and it's all of that work has

1309
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:22,040
been adopted in the latest version of

1310
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:24,139
the Etsy NFV TST zero zero nine document

1311
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,670
which I saw in your reference yeah so no

1312
01:08:24,139 --> 01:08:29,509
there's a new version of that coming out

1313
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:31,929
in June so if you look way in the back I

1314
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:34,339
think it's section there cause 12.4

1315
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:37,069
you'll see some procedures for testing

1316
01:08:34,339 --> 01:08:39,618
in that area and then you'll see some

1317
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:41,619
sample results on a wiki page and an

1318
01:08:39,618 --> 01:08:43,939
additional discussion in the appendices

1319
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:45,920
about that kind of testing so I

1320
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:48,799
encourage you to take a look at that and

1321
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,299
maybe reference some of it and examine

1322
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:53,868
how that works in the container world

1323
01:08:50,299 --> 01:09:01,599
I'd really love to see that as well okay

1324
01:08:53,868 --> 01:09:07,698
thank you any other comments folks

1325
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:12,279
questions anybody read the draft yes one

1326
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:12,278
gentleman the back there okay and us

1327
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:26,359
is it somebody on my cycle yeah yes yes

1328
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:29,270
yeah okay yes so I did not manage green

1329
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:32,029
light is 0-1 but I did review the zero

1330
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:33,530
zero and those very promising work based

1331
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:35,389
on the the presentation right now I

1332
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:37,460
think looks like the good progress at

1333
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:41,210
any rate but I just wanted to volunteer

1334
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:45,260
to review in zero long as it seems that

1335
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:47,390
there may be some relation to the the

1336
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:49,790
other draft that we have in a working

1337
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:52,370
group which is the NF and ethnicity

1338
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:54,680
draft but but this draft is approaching

1339
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:58,280
the problem from the more you know

1340
01:09:54,680 --> 01:10:01,880
technology use perspective where on the

1341
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,980
in the other work we're looking at more

1342
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,230
of the sort of abstracted of Suffolk way

1343
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,759
as I will present a bit a bit later but

1344
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,290
I think that two pieces of work are

1345
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,650
related and they are addressing a very

1346
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:17,840
important problem space that's all

1347
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:27,290
thanks thanks mass yet okay thank you

1348
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:30,950
thank you thank you okay so our next our

1349
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:35,090
next presentation comes from Rafael Rosa

1350
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:37,580
who is remote and Rafael is going to

1351
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:43,700
tell us about the methodology for vnf

1352
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:47,330
benchmarking automation and Rafael are

1353
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:51,940
you able to be heard

1354
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:55,580
yes yes we can very good that things so

1355
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:58,580
so I'm just following the updates from

1356
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:01,550
the best version we had some comments in

1357
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:04,700
the the meeting that Manuel presented in

1358
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:07,130
Prague so basically I'm going to address

1359
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:10,160
some of these comments and how the draft

1360
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:13,610
is updated based on our current last

1361
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:15,470
prototypes in our test comparisons very

1362
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:19,990
good try to make it in ten minutes here

1363
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:19,990
Rafael thank you okay next slide please

1364
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:28,600
so although the director mate was

1365
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:30,340
mailing updated because we needed to

1366
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,290
have some initially some clear

1367
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,870
considerations regarding this

1368
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:37,870
benchmarking procedures that are the

1369
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:40,930
defining section 4.2 basically they

1370
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:42,550
define the generic manners for and

1371
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:44,770
considerations for a benchmarking

1372
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:47,680
procedures in an automated way that we

1373
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:51,370
plan to address in in the draft we also

1374
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:53,950
saw that we needed more comparison

1375
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:57,610
factors in our vnf benchmarking

1376
01:11:53,950 --> 01:12:00,639
descriptor definition that we saw that

1377
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:03,610
based on our experiments it was not yet

1378
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,290
a fully functional so we also needed

1379
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:07,860
that in the young model that we are

1380
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:11,380
developing to reflect those changes and

1381
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:13,210
also we wanted to put all the reference

1382
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:15,489
implementations and the comparison tests

1383
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:19,260
afraid of OD they were not previously

1384
01:12:15,489 --> 01:12:19,259
referred next slide please

1385
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:25,090
so the issues we are trying to address

1386
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:27,190
mailing the draft was actually to refine

1387
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:30,070
the terminology to focus only on the

1388
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:32,889
what is being addressed in the draft so

1389
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:37,349
we removed the mostly the MFE generic

1390
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:39,940
terminology from the draft we also

1391
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:41,980
defined that the generic benchmarking

1392
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:43,900
procedures would reflect the overall

1393
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:47,530
terminal methodology that we were

1394
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:49,839
addressing in the in the main section of

1395
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:52,660
the draft and especially when we are

1396
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,900
running the tests with our open source

1397
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:59,620
reference implementations we had issues

1398
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:02,679
ourselves in the members of the the

1399
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:04,960
draft that we sought divergences in in

1400
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,960
the robbers and listeners I mean the how

1401
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:11,739
you're executing the parameters of the

1402
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:15,040
test so we would have better definitions

1403
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:17,080
of this test parameters so we can have

1404
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,900
better comparison test we've had the

1405
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:24,309
Harris implementation

1406
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:27,820
next slide please so based on that the

1407
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:29,739
major technical changes that we had word

1408
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:32,380
that we filtered this only important

1409
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:34,089
concept in terminology we define it in

1410
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,130
this section for the two

1411
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:38,020
the generic faces that we think that

1412
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:41,350
address is a generic benchmarking

1413
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:43,990
process procedures since the deployment

1414
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:46,960
of the scenario the configuration of the

1415
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:49,059
of the whole benchmarking deployment

1416
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,690
scenario the execution of the test

1417
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:58,720
itself and how the tests are reported

1418
01:13:52,690 --> 01:14:00,400
and and the main important updates in

1419
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:02,770
this draft was the refinement we met

1420
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,950
Mitch marking the scripture structure in

1421
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:11,890
section 6.1 where we define and the

1422
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:15,160
whole fields and definitions of what is

1423
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:18,070
inside each one of these sections in the

1424
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:20,170
VMF PD definition the header is the

1425
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:22,809
information of the target how the

1426
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:24,850
experiments are defined it especially

1427
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:26,740
the environment settings like how the

1428
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:29,740
components are going to be orchestrated

1429
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,420
or not in a deployment scenario the

1430
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,070
scenario itself like to mean the

1431
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,160
topology for the test how it's been

1432
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:41,370
defined at this structure here we are

1433
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:44,400
thinking about referring to the the

1434
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:46,990
actual existing task our young

1435
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:50,049
references that we're still trying to

1436
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:52,570
see if it's feasible or not for this VM

1437
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:55,630
FBD model or make it more generic as

1438
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:57,820
possible and we also define under the

1439
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:01,450
proceedings that mainly mainly define

1440
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:03,700
how the VMF are dead less shootings in

1441
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:05,769
this case is benchmarking and the whole

1442
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:09,540
tools and the parameters for these tools

1443
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:13,120
to operate and generate the test results

1444
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:16,150
based on that we updated the ENFP d yang

1445
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,830
model and we pushed the gene maja

1446
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:23,019
updated efference the open source

1447
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:28,690
repository to the the draft as well next

1448
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:31,240
slide please so what we still have to do

1449
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:33,370
and we need further discussion we have

1450
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:36,010
still the section that we are now

1451
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:39,220
addressing is the VMF performance

1452
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:43,660
profile structure this concerns mailing

1453
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:46,780
the report of the results of the of the

1454
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:48,670
VMF benchmarking the script execution

1455
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,440
so in this case we are mostly concerned

1456
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:53,470
about the generic representation but

1457
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:56,259
useful enough for foreign registration

1458
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:58,740
solution to have it as a source of of

1459
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:02,110
data for analytics platforms

1460
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:04,510
we are also mailing a working parallel

1461
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:07,299
with the writing of the draft and the

1462
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:10,710
comparison tests with our open source

1463
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:13,720
reference implementations so we are

1464
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:15,610
mostly concerned enough about name the

1465
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,670
next version fully demonstrated the

1466
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:20,320
importance of the draft in the whole

1467
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:21,970
definition of the VNS bitch marking

1468
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,759
descriptor in the V&F performance

1469
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:27,070
profile how they can be compared

1470
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,040
compared with each other in different

1471
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:31,690
instance and especially in different

1472
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,710
references our reference implementations

1473
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:37,059
so this is all open source as well and

1474
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:39,040
then in this case we are also planning

1475
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:40,720
to to showcase the validity and utility

1476
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,240
of the young models that you are

1477
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:46,150
developing for the DNF niche marking

1478
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:48,670
descriptor in the performance profile we

1479
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:51,129
still have a lot of work in the BMW G

1480
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:54,400
that we see that's related especially

1481
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:58,920
the the last presentation for example we

1482
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:00,940
are dressing those and we plan to take

1483
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:05,380
oscillations for each one of these these

1484
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:07,290
ongoing tracks as well so next slide

1485
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:11,530
please

1486
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:14,950
so yes that's that's all and we invite

1487
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:19,719
you guys to review and then share your

1488
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:22,630
comments about the draft thank you very

1489
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:25,090
good thanks Raphael so um any any

1490
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:27,340
comments on the topics that Raphael

1491
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:29,140
covered very efficiently there there's

1492
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:32,590
obviously a lot of work behind this and

1493
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:34,230
I I was interested to try to get a side

1494
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:37,350
meeting going where we could see a

1495
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:41,200
demonstration of everything we we have

1496
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:43,660
seen contributed by Raphael and his team

1497
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:47,200
but that doesn't work out of your remote

1498
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:49,019
rocky hill so yeah yeah the the side

1499
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,730
meetings are all sort of not covered and

1500
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:53,320
but that's okay well so we'll try to get

1501
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:55,150
we'll try to get that done at a at a

1502
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,759
future meeting or some other opportunity

1503
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:59,639
where we can see the demo maybe an

1504
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:05,200
interim meeting something like that

1505
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:11,170
okay so any any volunteers to review the

1506
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:13,420
draft and/or look into the code repo yes

1507
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:20,680
one in the back there okay please go up

1508
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:22,440
to the mic and give us your name okay

1509
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:27,940
good good to meet you boys

1510
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:33,490
thank you okay so we've got a volunteer

1511
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:35,500
for the review and anything else any I'm

1512
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:37,300
glad you you recognized the overlap with

1513
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:40,630
some of the other efforts Raphael

1514
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:43,090
especially the yang model for for the

1515
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:45,580
for the tester control that Vladimir has

1516
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:47,380
proposed he's got he's got some text on

1517
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:49,900
that and that's something to look into

1518
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:54,750
too as a kind of like a cross review for

1519
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:58,540
sure I see that I see vitomir nodding so

1520
01:18:54,750 --> 01:19:01,030
so that's the core to our ideas just to

1521
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:04,210
get closer and closer to the ongoing

1522
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:08,290
drafts as well so we have more ways to

1523
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:10,590
show the the let's see how our draft and

1524
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:14,110
can be useful for the other

1525
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:16,660
implementations and the voice first sure

1526
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:20,049
sure and and and don't forget some of

1527
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:22,540
the other industry references to the you

1528
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:26,860
know the work going on in Etsy and OPN

1529
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:29,860
RV is I mean they've got benchmarking

1530
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:31,750
tools there and and aspects that are

1531
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:44,380
quite relevant to the work you're

1532
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:48,490
attempting sure excellent thanks so it's

1533
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:52,090
Tim Carly Carlene sorry Tim Tim Carlin

1534
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:54,790
from oh yeah great thanks Tim Tim Carlin

1535
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:58,890
from the UNH interoperability labs is

1536
01:19:54,790 --> 01:20:04,840
going to go dig into your repo so people

1537
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:06,040
perfect thank you stuff running you're

1538
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,250
gonna get some Garrett changes out of

1539
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:11,460
that I'll bet

1540
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:14,500
thank you okay thank you

1541
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:19,179
so next up we're going to be moving back

1542
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:24,670
to Maciek for the NFA service density

1543
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:29,190
benchmarking discussion okay I should be

1544
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:31,420
back yes we can hear you good

1545
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:33,070
sorry's Sara's quickly and efficiently

1546
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:36,190
bringing up the slides here today

1547
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:37,960
accent so I will try to stick to the

1548
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:43,150
best practice of keeping within 10

1549
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:45,460
minutes and yeah all right so hello

1550
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:48,099
again and I'm magic Constance knowledge

1551
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:51,790
I'll be presenting the work we've been

1552
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:55,449
doing with Peter Miko's who is also one

1553
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:58,989
of the promote participants on the nav

1554
01:20:55,449 --> 01:21:00,669
service the city presented the first one

1555
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:08,049
session of this work was seen in Prague

1556
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:11,710
and next slide so we here we also

1557
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:16,060
received comments on LF an FDA OCC

1558
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:20,410
Garrett which which we addressed and the

1559
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:22,660
major updates are related to the adding

1560
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:24,160
specific nav service take the plane

1561
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:29,250
benchmarking metrics which I will cover

1562
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:31,840
on one of the next slides and and also

1563
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:34,380
on the requests from from

1564
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,610
electromagnetic bench I added the

1565
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:38,820
references and we added the references

1566
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:43,000
and also the placeholder for the results

1567
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:47,830
as as he is applying the methodology to

1568
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,890
the nav bench tests including the black

1569
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:52,120
vests that I think he is attending to

1570
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:54,040
running an ad bench

1571
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,540
within the context of okie in the week

1572
01:21:54,040 --> 01:22:02,710
and also added the security

1573
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:06,570
consideration section now I'm the the

1574
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:10,239
target of the of the draft is ability to

1575
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:13,030
benchmark applications independently if

1576
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:15,580
they are running on on pure metal IBM's

1577
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:19,440
or containers and trying to capture and

1578
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:21,210
and and also abstract the way that the

1579
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,099
network application

1580
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:27,350
which were referring to them here as as

1581
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:33,920
functions or or and then B versus and

1582
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:38,460
are actually deployed and next slide and

1583
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:42,060
the the three main the mid the main

1584
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:46,140
challenge we are aiming to address with

1585
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:48,330
the draft is in measuring performance of

1586
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,920
a single function application or network

1587
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:54,199
application on a server running solo

1588
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:59,219
it's fairly straight court and it gets

1589
01:22:54,199 --> 01:23:00,239
harder if you have many of them or they

1590
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:02,430
are in the prisons and other

1591
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:05,190
applications and you know trying to

1592
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:06,960
address the noisy neighbor problem so in

1593
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:09,299
the context of your running colony

1594
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:12,630
network applications and about so many

1595
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:16,170
of them and then being arranged in some

1596
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:19,910
sort of virtual topology in you know

1597
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:22,610
circus trains or service topologies the

1598
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:25,559
the presence of the food allergies and

1599
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:29,480
also here complicates we give the

1600
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:32,730
problem the idea is to come up with a a

1601
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:37,589
fairly Universal generic way to

1602
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:46,320
benchmark those heavy services as next

1603
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:49,350
slide so what are the main factors in a

1604
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:52,349
network application performance the the

1605
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:55,770
direct actors are clearly the software

1606
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:59,730
code that these processing packets and

1607
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:01,880
this configuration and the way that this

1608
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:04,679
application build of this code our

1609
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:10,080
virtual topologies and the external

1610
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:11,910
stimuli that drives the said but there

1611
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,440
are also two other indirect factors and

1612
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:15,480
that's the the virtualization

1613
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:19,730
technologies used to create those

1614
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:25,199
virtual cookies and like you know patio

1615
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:29,589
or Mikko net we hope the user or mimic

1616
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:32,648
in container space and our anniversary

1617
01:24:29,589 --> 01:24:33,969
and then also the way that the record

1618
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:36,399
application is connected to the physical

1619
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:41,939
network which we are calling here and a

1620
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,939
host that's working I'm excited

1621
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:48,699
so most solution proposed in the draft

1622
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:51,219
and it's pretty much the same slide as I

1623
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:54,219
presented last time so a very quick

1624
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:56,889
recap is to separate the three aspects

1625
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:59,379
coordinate design and the service I can

1626
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:01,959
processing part so that the Metro

1627
01:24:59,379 --> 01:25:04,119
application layer itself and the shared

1628
01:25:01,959 --> 01:25:07,269
requisition infrastructure and then the

1629
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:08,709
shared health infrastructure and from

1630
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:11,559
the resource allocation perspective

1631
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:16,329
pocos addressing annoys me the most

1632
01:25:11,559 --> 01:25:18,069
neighbor problem is for starters the

1633
01:25:16,329 --> 01:25:19,808
problems on you know allocating the

1634
01:25:18,069 --> 01:25:22,959
resources as per current best practice

1635
01:25:19,809 --> 01:25:25,899
so that's happening my affinity and

1636
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:27,818
limiting the linguist editor I should

1637
01:25:25,899 --> 01:25:29,409
operate the system editor I should add

1638
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:32,979
that bullet point it's covered in the

1639
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:35,438
draft and going forward that's what

1640
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:37,059
covers it up and going forward I'm

1641
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:39,249
looking at what the material can also

1642
01:25:37,059 --> 01:25:42,729
manage the LLC resources the last level

1643
01:25:39,249 --> 01:25:44,619
cache for courses and this part is for

1644
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:51,159
future work and it's currently not

1645
01:25:44,619 --> 01:25:54,188
correct next slide so the way we would

1646
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:57,669
define the service and we abstract it I

1647
01:25:54,189 --> 01:26:00,129
feel a topology the top which is how

1648
01:25:57,669 --> 01:26:01,749
they how the network application support

1649
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:04,149
functions are connected or

1650
01:26:01,749 --> 01:26:07,719
interconnected and put that host data

1651
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:10,479
plane or directly a configuration so

1652
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:13,780
that how they are configured and and the

1653
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:16,689
final one is you know the what is the

1654
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:19,959
actual packet packet flow and the packet

1655
01:26:16,689 --> 01:26:22,059
path through the food for the service

1656
01:26:19,959 --> 01:26:24,849
definition or service or service channel

1657
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:27,969
and so that's the defined service

1658
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:31,359
obstructions so far and the next slide

1659
01:26:27,969 --> 01:26:34,089
shows you know that defined scenarios

1660
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:35,889
that are basically applying the first

1661
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:39,309
abstraction to the to the scenario so we

1662
01:26:35,889 --> 01:26:41,490
may draft we defined three scenarios

1663
01:26:39,309 --> 01:26:44,260
one of them based on

1664
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:47,080
network applications run new VMs so we

1665
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:49,540
refer to them as as vnfs and vmf service

1666
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:54,850
chain for the virtual switch as shown

1667
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:57,610
and with the the other two are based on

1668
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:59,230
containers which we refer to as your

1669
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:00,549
container Network function so this is

1670
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:04,179
the network application onion container

1671
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:06,070
and and we have a snake forwarding so

1672
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:09,460
you know service chain which is like

1673
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:11,920
forwarding and the last one is we refer

1674
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:13,660
to as sin of service pipeline and

1675
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:18,700
pipeline for working with horizontal

1676
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:20,580
interfaces next slide in terms of the

1677
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:23,440
benchmarking metric so this is the

1678
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:27,370
complaint we objected to the version

1679
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:29,710
zero one we want to measure packet

1680
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:31,390
throughput in packets per second and

1681
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:34,030
then calculate the bandwidth throughput

1682
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:37,380
based on the you know the packet size

1683
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:40,389
and and such in in bits per second and

1684
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:42,520
be applicable types of super trades that

1685
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:46,870
we have listed includes the NVR so zero

1686
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:50,950
packet loss PDR so partial packet loss

1687
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:53,110
and mr r which is the result for maximum

1688
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:54,580
receive rate and we provide them so we

1689
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:57,910
added the definitions of what that

1690
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:59,710
exactly is in in the draft so this is

1691
01:27:57,910 --> 01:28:02,620
the maximum that so we get you getting

1692
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:05,290
through the system regardless of of

1693
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:09,930
packet loss and then we also have a

1694
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:09,930
latency that is measured at different

1695
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:15,880
different packet loads and we sort of

1696
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:18,550
provided the high level guidance of

1697
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:22,000
light medium and heavy load and without

1698
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:26,170
the actual definitions to definitions

1699
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,790
and and and the latency being measured

1700
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:35,800
in a both forward and reverse direction

1701
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:39,100
and next slide so next is a set of

1702
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:41,020
simple measurements due the time I will

1703
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:43,870
this is the basically the way we define

1704
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:46,390
various core allocation core locations

1705
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:48,790
core resource allocations to the to the

1706
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:51,570
data plane workers and I will skip the

1707
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:51,570
slide extract please

1708
01:28:53,409 --> 01:28:59,348
and and this is really to to illustrate

1709
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:00,999
the resource allocation to the two set

1710
01:28:59,349 --> 01:29:03,489
of graphs the next two slides are

1711
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:05,228
showing where the the network

1712
01:29:03,489 --> 01:29:07,089
applications are running either on a one

1713
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:08,619
physical core or they're running on a

1714
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:10,239
half physical core basically running

1715
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:12,880
hyper-threading and using only a single

1716
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:15,610
logical threat where we can get higher

1717
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:21,849
density of those of those network

1718
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:27,759
applications and next slide so these are

1719
01:29:21,849 --> 01:29:30,820
the the tests that we run in in MVA

1720
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:34,449
assisted and also there is a CNF a

1721
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:36,999
testbed project within the CNC F where

1722
01:29:34,449 --> 01:29:40,018
they run a similar test and there is a

1723
01:29:36,999 --> 01:29:42,699
reference later on to that that project

1724
01:29:40,019 --> 01:29:45,219
so this is basically running multiple of

1725
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:47,558
either vnf service chains CNF service

1726
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:49,209
chains or or CNF service pipelines and

1727
01:29:47,559 --> 01:29:53,139
you've got two versions of software

1728
01:29:49,209 --> 01:29:55,389
users here in this case it's VPP 1904

1729
01:29:53,139 --> 01:30:01,389
which is what we run in the vio system

1730
01:29:55,389 --> 01:30:04,739
next slide so these are the the graphs

1731
01:30:01,389 --> 01:30:08,919
and the main really message here is that

1732
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:12,039
or the top level is that there's a

1733
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:14,289
comparison between the the vnf service

1734
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:17,530
chains CNF service chains and cmf

1735
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:19,599
service pipelines where the the device

1736
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:23,409
on their tests so the device is actually

1737
01:30:19,599 --> 01:30:25,869
under under load and oversubscribed is a

1738
01:30:23,409 --> 01:30:29,188
virtual switch and it clearly shows that

1739
01:30:25,869 --> 01:30:31,539
you know the pipeline is is better

1740
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:33,939
because the virtual switch is processing

1741
01:30:31,539 --> 01:30:36,489
packets only at the entrance and exit to

1742
01:30:33,939 --> 01:30:38,889
the to disturb resistance whereas for

1743
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:40,780
the other truth it goes and takes part

1744
01:30:38,889 --> 01:30:44,079
in to processing the packets in between

1745
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:47,889
there will be the VMF so synapse and the

1746
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:49,808
CNF is slightly better faster due to the

1747
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:52,539
you know containerized virtual

1748
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:55,419
infrastructure for packet processing for

1749
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:59,380
the for the middle case and next like

1750
01:30:55,419 --> 01:31:01,090
that so that's that's ten minutes masya

1751
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:03,579
if you can wrap it up here please yeah

1752
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:06,250
that's that's the last the last slide

1753
01:31:03,579 --> 01:31:09,820
this slide just shows the various

1754
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:11,860
our metrics and with with a higher

1755
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:13,509
density of network functions again those

1756
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:16,900
the results are specific to the

1757
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:27,750
application tested in this case VPP next

1758
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:30,639
slide so as similar to previous comments

1759
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:34,600
that I made on the on our search I

1760
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:36,790
welcome more reviews from BMW G we have

1761
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:40,720
received received comments from Alec

1762
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:43,210
from OPM AV MFP bench I project but

1763
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:46,990
that's pretty much about it we had no

1764
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:49,150
discussion at the the proc ITF but we'll

1765
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:51,550
welcome more more comments in terms of

1766
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:54,940
applicability of this work and specific

1767
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:58,690
steps to make this a BMW G draft of the

1768
01:31:54,940 --> 01:32:00,990
current things are thank you Maciek so

1769
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:03,339
there's there's a lot of obvious

1770
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:05,139
reviewers here the folks that mentioned

1771
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:07,600
some overlap and and that you've

1772
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:09,460
observed some overlap with this work so

1773
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:14,110
I hope some of those folks will will

1774
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:15,880
volunteer to be reviewers here one one

1775
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:19,240
one technical comment before we do that

1776
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:22,270
though I noticed your data plane metrics

1777
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:24,820
for you know for latency and and so

1778
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:27,040
forth I think there's I think there's

1779
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:30,519
already good metrics in test your zero

1780
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,780
nine that cover most of that space you

1781
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,420
know all there's slightly different

1782
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:37,000
names but we've got good metric

1783
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:39,820
definitions there and I would hate to

1784
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:43,420
see that sort of get renamed in in in

1785
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:46,299
this work you know we can we can do the

1786
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:48,540
cross-referencing look to look to BMW G

1787
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:52,330
terminology first and then the Etsy nfe

1788
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:54,400
terminology next before we go inventing

1789
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:56,710
something new and I know I know stuff

1790
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:59,920
has been used in in practice for a long

1791
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:02,710
time but let's but let's try to reuse

1792
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,900
the of the standard definitions where we

1793
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:06,310
can of course yeah we'll take this the

1794
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:10,440
feedback so we'll cross reference the

1795
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:14,740
TST Oh 909 the next version thank you oh

1796
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:17,139
good so now I'm going to ask for

1797
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:19,860
volunteer reviewers here so we can move

1798
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,860
this work along

1799
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:26,150
Raffaele on the jabber room is signing

1800
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:31,880
up okay that's good

1801
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:34,219
so Raphael the the automation system has

1802
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:36,639
signed up to review draft there Maciek

1803
01:33:34,219 --> 01:33:36,639
that's good

1804
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:50,150
Thanks and okay all right thanks very

1805
01:33:44,389 --> 01:33:52,219
much so now we've got now we've got a

1806
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:54,768
couple of drafts on going back to the

1807
01:33:52,219 --> 01:33:59,179
evpn topic we've got a couple of drafts

1808
01:33:54,769 --> 01:34:08,869
from sidon and the first ones on evpn

1809
01:33:59,179 --> 01:34:11,690
multi casting let's let's go let's go a

1810
01:34:08,869 --> 01:34:30,679
total of 15 for both how about that and

1811
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:36,799
all and all for both sets asides thank

1812
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:41,510
you yeah good morning everyone this the

1813
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:44,840
benchmarking draft this is based on the

1814
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:47,179
parent you know the evpn RFC RFC seven

1815
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:51,889
four three two and the recent draft

1816
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:54,739
which is adopted by the eye IETF best

1817
01:34:51,889 --> 01:34:57,050
working group EVP and I JMB MLD proxy

1818
01:34:54,739 --> 01:35:01,129
which is widely deployed in data center

1819
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:04,329
and the MPLS service provider network so

1820
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:07,010
we are defining certain parameters to

1821
01:35:04,329 --> 01:35:09,920
benchmark you know because currently

1822
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:12,889
there is no way we can benchmark these

1823
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:15,440
services which is already implemented so

1824
01:35:12,889 --> 01:35:20,570
we are defining certain parameters to

1825
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:23,598
measure this EVP and IGM be a proxy you

1826
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:25,159
know draft which is currently currently

1827
01:35:23,599 --> 01:35:29,900
adopted by the IETF in the best working

1828
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:32,690
group so this is a topology in you know

1829
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:35,389
in art lab so we have a

1830
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:38,419
the leaf we have a leaf which is a multi

1831
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:42,260
home and we have two dots and one one

1832
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:44,420
that is a single home and one dot which

1833
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:47,330
is connected to a multi home multi home

1834
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:50,870
evpn multi home active active scenario

1835
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:52,699
and we have a spines and the arty is is

1836
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:55,010
a traffic generator which is which is

1837
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:58,429
connected which is similar emulating the

1838
01:35:55,010 --> 01:36:03,080
host as well as the source for the IGMP

1839
01:35:58,430 --> 01:36:05,719
as well as the multicast traffic so we

1840
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:09,469
these are the parameters we are defining

1841
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:13,160
to benchmark this service so we are

1842
01:36:09,469 --> 01:36:17,120
defining the IgM b.join latency so how

1843
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:20,809
fast which is a IgM be in it will join

1844
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:22,820
in that once 8i j mb report the

1845
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:26,030
membership report comes to the dot and

1846
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:28,730
it sends the type six routes and able to

1847
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:31,400
get the traffic and then the IgM believe

1848
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:33,889
there are two types of one you send I

1849
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:37,160
believe or it is a time out if the host

1850
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:40,940
is not responding to that so how fast

1851
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:42,530
you know it is it is gonna leave you

1852
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:44,509
know that it has to stop the traffic

1853
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:47,030
unnecessary flooding flooding to the

1854
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:49,219
system so these are the two you know

1855
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:53,420
clearing the state as well as the leave

1856
01:36:49,219 --> 01:36:56,030
latency as well as the IgM be in the

1857
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:57,620
leaf as well as the timeout then that is

1858
01:36:56,030 --> 01:37:00,320
for the single homing that in

1859
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:03,290
multihoming we have it which is

1860
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:06,860
different from the single homing devices

1861
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:08,780
which is difficult if I nin the IgM be

1862
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:10,519
draught bearing you have active active

1863
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:13,429
scenarios they have a couple of routes

1864
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:16,280
which is defined to join sync as well as

1865
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:18,350
the leaf sync so the test environment is

1866
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:22,849
different from the single homing devices

1867
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:25,910
so we so that is why the we have you

1868
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:28,489
know testing for igme join as well as

1869
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:31,460
the the leaf timeout as well as when you

1870
01:37:28,489 --> 01:37:34,040
get a leave message I believe so how

1871
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:36,170
fast it is it stops and it is not

1872
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:38,480
flooding flooding to that and how fast

1873
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:40,850
it is singing the routes between the

1874
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,160
multi home multihoming devices so that

1875
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:45,320
that traffic should flow into the system

1876
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,910
so that it know how fast is go so that

1877
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,910
you don't feel

1878
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:53,059
there is a ghosting of the channel or

1879
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:55,550
this you know a picture freeze like that

1880
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:58,400
so how fast so based on this parameter

1881
01:37:55,550 --> 01:38:01,250
we benchmark the the boxes or the

1882
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:03,820
devices then we have a certain negative

1883
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:06,500
scenarios which we define the during

1884
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:08,780
multihoming if one one of the router

1885
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:11,180
fails if the link goes down so how fast

1886
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:15,200
is gonna sink and start forwarding the

1887
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:18,230
traffic to the the sea or the this host

1888
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:19,610
which is connected and we have a code

1889
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:23,540
failure if the core failure which

1890
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:26,000
happens how fast the traffic is gone to

1891
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:28,630
redirect to the the other forwarder

1892
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,090
which is working in the multihoming and

1893
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:34,670
in the star the traffic starts flow I

1894
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:36,590
bunts the core is failed so it has to

1895
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:39,200
immediately detect the failure as well

1896
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:41,900
as switch the traffic to the you know

1897
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:45,380
the multi other multihoming router so we

1898
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:49,400
have a scale test wherein we emulate lot

1899
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:52,180
of hosts as hosting the network and we

1900
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:55,639
send lot of IgM B membership report and

1901
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:58,280
so how how fast which is gonna this

1902
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:00,890
handle the Box is gonna handle this this

1903
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:04,519
kind of sargent the traffic as well as

1904
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:06,170
it starts forwarding it during scaled

1905
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,540
convergence testing then it's a

1906
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:12,350
traditional high availability test run

1907
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:15,920
run for a period of 24 hours and see we

1908
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:19,400
are not getting any core or any memory

1909
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:21,080
leaks and the soak the I availability

1910
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:23,299
sorry high availability is where there

1911
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,850
is a routing engine failure so how fast

1912
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,410
it's gonna take the load and we are

1913
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:29,720
defining the soap which is running

1914
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:31,820
running over a period of time for 24

1915
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:33,560
hours so the expectation is we ship with

1916
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:36,380
the system should perform there should

1917
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:40,130
not be any memory leak and there should

1918
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:43,580
not be any core generated and this the

1919
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:46,490
system should work as expected so these

1920
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:51,100
are the parameters we are defining for

1921
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:55,719
benchmarking this murray VPN i GMB proxy

1922
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:55,720
services so any questions on this

1923
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:04,830
so he'll this is just an expansion of

1924
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:07,500
what we the parameters we already

1925
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:09,119
mentioned like how you know the learning

1926
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:11,010
rate because that is very important

1927
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:14,339
because different boxes the performances

1928
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:16,710
are different so because in data center

1929
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:20,010
or in a service provider you have a lot

1930
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:22,080
of multicast channels I mean services

1931
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:25,199
which is going so the learning rate is

1932
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:28,170
one of the important parameter to define

1933
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:31,830
a box like how fast it is it is going to

1934
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:34,860
you know learn the membership report and

1935
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:37,590
sends the route and just joins that you

1936
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:39,360
know it just sends edge then joins the

1937
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:41,580
tree and sends the traffic to this

1938
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:43,380
segment as well as the leave is also

1939
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:45,559
because that is one of the important

1940
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:48,449
factor wherein it should not fled the

1941
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:51,800
you know an unnecessary flag to the

1942
01:40:48,449 --> 01:40:55,799
segment and it's not a and if you fit us

1943
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:57,179
it's not timeout it is gonna flood the

1944
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,360
system and it will be a wasteful of

1945
01:40:57,179 --> 01:41:02,969
bandwidth so the timeout is IB timeout

1946
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:05,670
as one of the parameters wearing we see

1947
01:41:02,969 --> 01:41:09,330
how the box process is large number of

1948
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:12,030
you know messages i am i mean if the i j

1949
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:14,099
mb messages once it is not refreshing it

1950
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:16,619
so how fast it is going to time out and

1951
01:41:14,099 --> 01:41:20,040
stop that the multicast traffic to the

1952
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:23,309
segment so the system i mean it should

1953
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:24,599
not you know even if it is timeout it

1954
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,219
should not send the traffic to the

1955
01:41:24,599 --> 01:41:29,730
system and it will be a wastage of

1956
01:41:26,219 --> 01:41:33,900
bandwidth so the the leave latency is

1957
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:37,138
where in when it gets an IgM be you know

1958
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:39,629
so i djembe report so it's for leave

1959
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:41,790
messages and it should stop it's a very

1960
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:44,159
large rate it should stop immediately

1961
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:46,290
that because there will be a note box

1962
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:49,650
performance based on different boxes

1963
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:52,560
there will be a you know sometimes you

1964
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:54,269
know the the reset lag in that it won't

1965
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,639
process immediately there there there is

1966
01:41:54,270 --> 01:42:00,119
a time period where in its again start

1967
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:02,760
sending to to that local segment so we

1968
01:42:00,119 --> 01:42:05,219
measure that how fast the box is gonna

1969
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:09,500
one sees get get the leave messages how

1970
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:09,500
fast the box is gonna behave this

1971
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:16,989
so it is this is a typical scenario

1972
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:19,360
where in this routes because the VPN new

1973
01:42:16,989 --> 01:42:21,699
type of routes which is defined in the

1974
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:26,380
draft because type six seven and eight

1975
01:42:21,699 --> 01:42:29,348
it the six route is bearing it's a IJ MB

1976
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:31,599
estimate and seven and eight is joined

1977
01:42:29,349 --> 01:42:33,280
sink in multihoming as well as the leap

1978
01:42:31,599 --> 01:42:36,999
sink because the multihoming is very

1979
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:39,249
important like if one of the anon DF I

1980
01:42:36,999 --> 01:42:41,199
mean one of them Don DF gets the join

1981
01:42:39,249 --> 01:42:44,260
messages then it has to inform the DF

1982
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:47,228
and its it has to send the type six

1983
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:48,639
routes so how how fast is it because it

1984
01:42:47,229 --> 01:42:51,010
is interaction between the multiple

1985
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,829
routers in the EVP and multihoming

1986
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:57,039
scenario this is where on important

1987
01:42:53,829 --> 01:42:58,509
things you know wherein we measure it

1988
01:42:57,039 --> 01:42:59,978
because that is very important in the

1989
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:07,269
data center as well as in the service

1990
01:42:59,979 --> 01:43:08,619
provider scenarios okay yeah this is an

1991
01:43:07,269 --> 01:43:11,619
expansion which I've already mentioned

1992
01:43:08,619 --> 01:43:13,598
like it's a we are measuring the

1993
01:43:11,619 --> 01:43:16,449
failures like the failure rate is

1994
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:19,209
important so that to out how fast it is

1995
01:43:16,449 --> 01:43:21,610
going to mitigate this failures so we

1996
01:43:19,209 --> 01:43:24,760
are doing that either the designated

1997
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:26,829
forward down and I mean doing local link

1998
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,599
failure core failures then the routing

1999
01:43:26,829 --> 01:43:31,570
engine suppose if the routing ancient

2000
01:43:28,599 --> 01:43:34,360
process itself fails and sometimes the

2001
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:36,728
DF the designated forwarder itself fails

2002
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:39,400
so these are all the type of you know

2003
01:43:36,729 --> 01:43:42,579
failure we do it on the system and see

2004
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:47,888
how fast it is recovering it and our

2005
01:43:42,579 --> 01:43:51,728
mitigate the failures and the scale is

2006
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:53,590
where we send large number of we first

2007
01:43:51,729 --> 01:43:55,119
determined these are the number of VLANs

2008
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:57,610
where will where will be using it and

2009
01:43:55,119 --> 01:44:01,360
this is the number of groups and based

2010
01:43:57,610 --> 01:44:03,518
based on a determined a scale of n how

2011
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:06,820
the system is gonna behave on that there

2012
01:44:03,519 --> 01:44:09,489
are a couple of scale convergence test

2013
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:12,549
first is a you know normal scenario

2014
01:44:09,489 --> 01:44:14,919
where and how fast it it is gonna you

2015
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:17,349
know how how fast it is going to set the

2016
01:44:14,919 --> 01:44:19,059
traffic and during any failure how fast

2017
01:44:17,349 --> 01:44:21,760
is it going to recover it at a scaled

2018
01:44:19,059 --> 01:44:23,499
environment so every box a and it

2019
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,550
depends on the CPU and the memory it

2020
01:44:23,499 --> 01:44:27,099
behaves different

2021
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:28,480
so this is where we parameter we define

2022
01:44:27,099 --> 01:44:33,369
a parameter and measure the system

2023
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:44,019
performance that's it thank you so how

2024
01:44:33,369 --> 01:44:52,500
many minutes you have any questions on

2025
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:57,070
this yep

2026
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:59,590
so this is a VPN be PWS this is defined

2027
01:44:57,070 --> 01:45:02,409
in RFC 8 to 1 4 which is recently

2028
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:06,329
converted into RFC Rivet was running a

2029
01:45:02,409 --> 01:45:09,879
society of draft recently I think around

2030
01:45:06,329 --> 01:45:12,759
six five six months packet it is I moved

2031
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:15,670
seven months back it moved into RFC so

2032
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:17,770
no it traditional because in vpw

2033
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:19,059
services is there for a pretty long time

2034
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:22,000
in service provider

2035
01:45:19,059 --> 01:45:23,949
the problem with EVP W services a

2036
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,579
point-to-point but you don't have a

2037
01:45:23,949 --> 01:45:31,239
multihoming features in bbws so the VPN

2038
01:45:27,579 --> 01:45:34,690
vpw services one of the advantages like

2039
01:45:31,239 --> 01:45:36,699
we can have a active active forwarding

2040
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:38,409
to the system point even though it is a

2041
01:45:36,699 --> 01:45:41,259
point-to-point services you can have

2042
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:43,719
more more than one router you know a

2043
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:46,389
load balancing the traffic to the same C

2044
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:48,489
so that and you can work in two dual

2045
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:50,199
modes like single single active as as

2046
01:45:48,489 --> 01:45:51,879
well as the active active either you can

2047
01:45:50,199 --> 01:45:54,400
work work as active backup you don't

2048
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:57,460
need to lose lose a link so you can work

2049
01:45:54,400 --> 01:46:00,098
as you know primary backup or it is

2050
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:04,780
active active you you can utilize both

2051
01:46:00,099 --> 01:46:08,829
the links so this is our test scenario

2052
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:12,699
where in the dot is being used as one of

2053
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:14,619
the multihoming piece and which is

2054
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:16,989
connected to AC and we have a router

2055
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:21,820
tester which is connected to the C as

2056
01:46:16,989 --> 01:46:24,848
well as to the single home P so these

2057
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:26,980
are the parameters to measure how to

2058
01:46:24,849 --> 01:46:28,690
measure this services like this services

2059
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:30,699
are widely deployed so how do you are

2060
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:33,759
gone and rate the system so we are

2061
01:46:30,699 --> 01:46:37,360
defining certain parameters on a you

2062
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:38,380
know based on our design our exhaustive

2063
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:40,900
testing so

2064
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:43,300
and we found out okay hey these are the

2065
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:46,509
list of parameters based on this

2066
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:49,150
particular device under test or the this

2067
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:50,949
particular we know routers and depends

2068
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:52,719
on the memory depends on CPU the

2069
01:46:50,949 --> 01:46:55,750
performance will be different so these

2070
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:58,659
are the parameters we defined how well

2071
01:46:55,750 --> 01:47:00,699
the box is gonna I mean perform for a

2072
01:46:58,659 --> 01:47:02,259
local local link failure so that

2073
01:47:00,699 --> 01:47:04,150
immediately it's switched to the other

2074
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:08,770
multihoming device and start forwarding

2075
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:10,960
it then the core failures these

2076
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:12,760
parameters are well understood and don't

2077
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,290
end in your drop I suggest you skip to

2078
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:20,860
the stuff you want to focus okay

2079
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:22,360
I think I made it crisp so I that's why

2080
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:26,080
I didn't expand it so I made it the

2081
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:28,210
first point on that so I think I'm done

2082
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:32,980
like next I will select comments and

2083
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:35,080
support so I mean so I mean you know

2084
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:37,089
either you can send a mailing list or if

2085
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:40,090
you have any questions please feel free

2086
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:40,889
to ask the questions here's my

2087
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:43,929
suggestion

2088
01:47:40,889 --> 01:47:48,150
why don't you circulate this draft and

2089
01:47:43,929 --> 01:47:52,750
on the I guess the best mailing list is

2090
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:55,150
try to get some evpn expertise - to

2091
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:57,520
review it there and to place their

2092
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:59,559
comments on our list if they're willing

2093
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,380
or at least at least exchanged some

2094
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:05,889
commentary here has anybody read either

2095
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:10,570
of these two drafts two people okay

2096
01:48:05,889 --> 01:48:12,219
okay that's good so I agree I don't

2097
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:13,870
we've talked a lot about having this

2098
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:16,630
reviewed outside of this working group

2099
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:18,370
so putting it on the working group list

2100
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:19,929
is a good start if you don't get the

2101
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:21,580
traction that you're looking for make

2102
01:48:19,929 --> 01:48:23,500
sure you're signing up potentially ask

2103
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:25,330
the chairs if you can get airtime and

2104
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,949
the next meeting so you can trump that

2105
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:31,630
support but we're going to need other

2106
01:48:26,949 --> 01:48:33,370
folks to read this assume that I'll you

2107
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:35,679
know I'll circulate in the best I am

2108
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:37,780
also part of the best working group so

2109
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:40,120
because I am also subscribing to that

2110
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:42,420
because I'm also active participant and

2111
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:45,190
that and definitely I'll talk to them I

2112
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:47,560
mean perhaps the first step is like I

2113
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:50,230
will first send the mailing list as you

2114
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:52,100
said like if you you know if it depends

2115
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:53,900
on the attraction the support is not al

2116
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:56,870
check that if you get some air time like

2117
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:58,940
you know yeah just keep us and the list

2118
01:48:56,870 --> 01:49:00,050
in the loop so that yeah definitely yes

2119
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:04,299
definitely

2120
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:04,300
yeah thank you thank you okay thanks

2121
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:33,710
Contreras 5g come down on the mic five

2122
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:35,830
the topic is 5g transport network

2123
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:38,720
benchmarking there's a lot of open space

2124
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:42,830
here that Louie's gonna try to cover in

2125
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:48,950
just five minutes right yeah okay so

2126
01:49:42,830 --> 01:49:52,420
okay so yeah the idea of this raft is

2127
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:54,410
basically to start digging on the

2128
01:49:52,420 --> 01:50:00,950
implications of ie in the transport

2129
01:49:54,410 --> 01:50:03,349
networks so yeah I think so basically

2130
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:05,480
the motivation is that now several

2131
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:07,670
operators across the world Americas Asia

2132
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:13,429
Europe are starting to deploy if AG

2133
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:15,950
access so Feige is for sure in impact in

2134
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:16,610
multiple technological areas the radio

2135
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:18,440
for sure

2136
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:21,650
the mobile packet core but also the

2137
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:23,299
transport network so the the idea of the

2138
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:26,240
limitation this is off is to start

2139
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:27,740
pushing on having the directions

2140
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,420
guidelines for which mark in the

2141
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:32,540
transport networks in such a way that

2142
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:34,790
could assist us the operators in the

2143
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:36,140
deployment of T stand in the support of

2144
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:39,440
the services that are respected to be

2145
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:40,640
offered to the to the customers so there

2146
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,139
in the graph you can see the different

2147
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,150
kind of imposition this is more or less

2148
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:46,370
well-known so I will pass to the next

2149
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:47,839
slide so this couple of the table will

2150
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:50,750
be basically to overview available

2151
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,550
solutions so the the for sure that would

2152
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:54,320
be available solutions and even in in

2153
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:56,180
the benchmarking multi group and also

2154
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,280
outside so I started by reviewing what

2155
01:50:56,180 --> 01:51:00,020
is available there identify the gaps

2156
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:02,450
that could require for their work so

2157
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:04,430
this idea of the ability to provide also

2158
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:05,929
directions for future work future

2159
01:51:04,430 --> 01:51:08,570
technologies and so I

2160
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:10,460
finally to provide guidelines on the 5g

2161
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:13,820
transport networking and also yeah

2162
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:15,050
basically defining these next steps so

2163
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:16,639
the site tells of the inter market

2164
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:18,620
analysis that we have identified so far

2165
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:21,290
and probably this could be somehow

2166
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:23,150
refined in next versions could be

2167
01:51:21,290 --> 01:51:25,640
basically data plane in the data plane

2168
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:27,889
we have we could identify two different

2169
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:30,890
kind of impacts our capabilities or

2170
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:33,800
either encapsulations examples of these

2171
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:35,390
with the TSM for instance I Triple E TSN

2172
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:38,690
but basically there is a different

2173
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:40,480
highly enough of Ethernet frames and so

2174
01:51:38,690 --> 01:51:43,190
we did button a on the hardware and

2175
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:45,799
regarding encapsulations clear test

2176
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:47,990
could be Samaritan version 6 also

2177
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:49,760
impacting sector of analysis could be

2178
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:54,019
the control plane and here we have a

2179
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:55,970
clear example with the FCAT 456 for Sdn

2180
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:59,240
probably this could be enough maybe not

2181
01:51:55,970 --> 01:52:01,640
so it's something to analyze regarding

2182
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:04,160
the management plane an example of

2183
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:05,990
potential topic could be the the

2184
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:08,300
network's life lifecycle focused on the

2185
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:11,000
transport capabilities basically and I

2186
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:12,650
got an architecture another topic that

2187
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,870
is being developed in IDF could be the

2188
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:17,870
deterministically networking so all the

2189
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:20,360
architectures about the net so the

2190
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:22,250
proposed next steps is basically for

2191
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:24,380
today to collect interest from the

2192
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:26,030
working group if this is interesting for

2193
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:28,790
the working group to progress on on this

2194
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:30,530
direction or not and if so so basically

2195
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:33,110
studied in to find requirements and

2196
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:34,910
characteristics that Feige imposes in in

2197
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:37,670
each of the studies of interest that we

2198
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:39,710
we have seen before I am preparing some

2199
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:42,980
progress for the job here for the next

2200
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:44,840
IDM meeting so the Vietnam will be - now

2201
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:48,500
whole in the Middle East to see if it is

2202
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:50,990
of interest for all of us and so start

2203
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:54,920
defined next double issuance a draft

2204
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:57,040
basically so thank you very much Thanks

2205
01:52:54,920 --> 01:53:01,240
thanks for Eason thanks for making that

2206
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:03,950
timely so yeah yeah please come on up

2207
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:08,170
yeah this is will from Poway

2208
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:11,540
I briefly read this draft and I think

2209
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:14,300
for example first of all 5g series is

2210
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:17,420
promising from promotion here however

2211
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:18,800
sorry service is a kind of large topic I

2212
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:21,290
see that you

2213
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:25,760
mentioned all this we kind of use cases

2214
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:26,150
and several categories of benchmarks hi

2215
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,030
Ryan

2216
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:32,690
I think that will make a lot of efforts

2217
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:35,330
to fulfill this work so I would suggest

2218
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:37,969
that we limit the scope into for example

2219
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:43,780
a year I don't know whether you wanted

2220
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:43,780
to the for example the 5g slicing or 5g

2221
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:50,120
dating services something like that so

2222
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:52,430
that's the so we'll that's your input on

2223
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:55,430
priorities you'd you'd rather see that

2224
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:57,440
done first and then work on something

2225
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:58,760
else that we've learned about that in

2226
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:01,940
some detail I think that's good feedback

2227
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,740
thank you just mentioning might be

2228
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:07,790
basically oh please just probably will

2229
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:09,830
be to to point out I mean what I expect

2230
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:11,390
this is not to cover everything in just

2231
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:13,430
one single document so having a

2232
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:14,870
different number of documents all these

2233
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:17,750
are probably could provide an overview

2234
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:20,150
with the development of specific areas

2235
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:23,920
in other specific documents for that so

2236
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:28,009
maybe this could be a way of proceeding

2237
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:31,490
so comment from Sarah as a participant

2238
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:33,470
we're not typically the experts every

2239
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:35,630
single person in BMW G is in the expert

2240
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:37,730
on wireless network cellular networks

2241
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:39,290
right so the first question that I have

2242
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:41,000
when I went to saw this was well why

2243
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:43,700
can't you characterize these same things

2244
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,290
the way you did a 4G network and I'm not

2245
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:47,840
proposing you answer that now I realize

2246
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:50,269
that that's absolutely a little bit of a

2247
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,580
longer answer but it would be nice if

2248
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:54,230
you would consider I can ask that on the

2249
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:57,220
list and you can answer on the list even

2250
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:59,509
if we had a post to point folks back to

2251
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:00,740
because I it's questionable should this

2252
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:03,410
happen here should this happen elsewhere

2253
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:05,179
I really hope it happens here I think

2254
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:06,670
it's a good thing to do but I would

2255
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:17,960
actually like to know the answer to that

2256
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:20,090
okay okay welcome to the group okay so

2257
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,380
yes but you have four minutes and X

2258
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:22,070
seconds and I'm gonna hold you to it

2259
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:26,650
okay

2260
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:26,650
all right sir Oh slides

2261
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:37,280
okay so this is the draft on individual

2262
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:40,210
draft from me and Jim Yutaro

2263
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:44,150
whose did stay through the whole meeting

2264
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:46,310
thanks Jim and it's on bench benchmarks

2265
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:48,730
and methods from multihomed evpn next

2266
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:48,730
slide please

2267
01:55:50,679 --> 01:55:57,080
all right so suden thanks very much for

2268
01:55:54,199 --> 01:55:59,570
your comments we had a detailed reply on

2269
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:03,170
the list this is a summary of changes in

2270
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:04,909
the the O 2 version that follows so we

2271
01:56:03,170 --> 01:56:13,670
got the car that's that's for the last

2272
01:56:04,909 --> 01:56:14,839
guy al Morton participant okay so these

2273
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:16,639
are some of the things that we've added

2274
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:20,659
as clarifications it basically comes

2275
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:23,150
down to you know a recognition that we

2276
01:56:20,659 --> 01:56:27,019
have a lot of material that we've drawn

2277
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:30,830
from other benchmarking RFC's into this

2278
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:32,869
draft and you know we we we skipped over

2279
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:35,420
it in the early versions now we're

2280
01:56:32,869 --> 01:56:36,799
trying to make it very clear so you know

2281
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:38,810
we're we're going to be very careful

2282
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,150
about the connectivity between the the

2283
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:42,820
CES and the PE stuff like that the

2284
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:46,489
diagrams need to show that pretty well

2285
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:47,780
flows and five tuples and so forth this

2286
01:56:46,489 --> 01:56:51,919
is going to be they're gonna be full

2287
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:55,280
mesh testing in some way and you know be

2288
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:57,050
the tester requirements from RFC 2889

2289
01:56:55,280 --> 01:57:00,559
you're gonna see that all over the place

2290
01:56:57,050 --> 01:57:02,840
here so that's part of the updates this

2291
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,610
is a figure two that we have clarified

2292
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:08,719
there to be sure that you know we're

2293
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:11,150
showing how the the c e on the right

2294
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:13,639
hand side c e 2 is connected to the test

2295
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:15,559
of ice we kind of ran out of ascii space

2296
01:57:13,639 --> 01:57:18,590
there and and had to move the whole

2297
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:21,860
thing over no big deal right okay so

2298
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:24,440
then and this here's an example of sort

2299
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:27,049
of the unicast flows and the and the

2300
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:31,309
frame formats must be specified all this

2301
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:32,690
stuff is 2889 specified already but now

2302
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:34,699
we've got explicit pointers to

2303
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:36,320
everything so it should be it should be

2304
01:57:34,699 --> 01:57:39,009
much easier to move between the two

2305
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:41,519
documents and not repeat everything else

2306
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:43,530
here so

2307
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:46,920
I think that's what we've accomplished

2308
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:49,980
basically out of the adding this new

2309
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:51,510
section basically 5.3 is a detailed

2310
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:54,719
procedure which is a completely new

2311
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:59,460
section and so then let's discuss or

2312
01:57:54,720 --> 01:58:02,490
draw the solution students said if the

2313
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:04,650
remote PE is single home and there it

2314
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:06,540
and there must be a router tester

2315
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:09,809
connected to it are you suggesting that

2316
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:11,070
we remove the single home ce2 we can do

2317
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:13,230
that but then we lose a simple

2318
01:58:11,070 --> 01:58:16,320
symmetrical test case that that was my

2319
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:18,629
response and so so we're and we're also

2320
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:21,809
kind of looking at maybe a new setup

2321
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:27,150
like figure two should include a c e

2322
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:29,420
which is single home to p e1 with es es

2323
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:32,460
i0 so going back to that picture oh

2324
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:35,940
there we go so we'd have so we'd have

2325
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:37,650
another c e up here which is single home

2326
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:40,440
i think that's one of the pictures that

2327
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:42,299
Jim drew so that's I mean that's one of

2328
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:44,400
the things we need to sort out and try

2329
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:49,470
to try to accomplish here while we're

2330
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:50,879
all sitting around together and so I you

2331
01:58:49,470 --> 01:58:52,320
know there was other interpretations of

2332
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,910
that we wanted to be sure that that was

2333
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:57,750
really kind of what you wanted and and

2334
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:59,910
what Jim had had proposed as well so

2335
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:03,300
let's let's the three of us get sit down

2336
01:58:59,910 --> 01:59:05,519
and make some progress on on your

2337
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:06,990
comments this week well will inform the

2338
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:07,910
mailing list and then we'll just move

2339
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:11,309
ahead
