1
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:34,829
really really neat one blue sheep vote

2
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,820
that are you're not there she is oh she

3
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:44,760
came back with the x-rays see somebody

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:53,100
tuft it you brought us much that's all

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:58,080
it is yeah thank you

6
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:04,710
yeah appreciate it okay let's get

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:07,979
started so this is ROM if that isn't

8
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:11,639
your drink of choice you could find

9
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:15,719
another another fine room there's plenty

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,070
of rooms to choose from we do have I do

11
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,740
remind you that there we have quite a

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,699
few participants that are remote

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,829
Omnitech Oh so please do use the

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,240
microphone carefully because those

15
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:34,309
people who are not in the room can't

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:38,669
hear you shouting across the room yes we

17
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,859
right we have a note-taker gene as

18
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,170
graciously volunteered and a jabber

19
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,589
scribe jonathan has graciously

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,560
volunteered but if please help them by

21
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,100
saying your name even though we know

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,950
everybody in this room please say your

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,109
name before everybody's sake it would be

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,950
very helpful on the other on the other

25
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,949
end exactly

26
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,369
we're we're it's still just Tuesday so

27
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,520
not everybody knows what note well is

28
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,640
again everybody in the room does but but

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,710
for those of you who are new to the ITF

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,859
process you really do need to

31
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:26,680
sure that you understand the the meaning

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:31,150
of the ITF note well this is all yeah

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,230
it's it's it's all um how did that work

34
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,230
there we go

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,380
it really does govern our conduct here

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,830
it's important that you understand what

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:54,160
it say says before you participate so

38
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,610
our agenda for today we have minute

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,890
taker

40
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:07,630
all right we'll start the blue sheets

41
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:12,339
going around right yeah our agenda for

42
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:15,180
today we're going to remind ourselves of

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,180
why we're here

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,730
Hennig is going to spend a little time

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,060
talking about other documents that are

46
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,220
relevant to the work that we are doing

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,740
and and maybe guideposts for things that

48
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,850
we want to take into account as we go

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:38,860
through our work there is a draft draft

50
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:41,799
Rose Andrew oo which I will present and

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:45,390
then we have an open discussion does

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,390
anyone wish to bash the agenda

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:04:13,150
okay so Eric so since I can follow

54
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:15,250
directions your name is very appropriate

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,920
the Internet Society it's got a bunch of

56
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,019
policy makers coming in one of the

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:26,590
things we talked about was how

58
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:29,849
governments and this is one of those

59
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,849
times that

60
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,330
we have a situation out there where

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,030
there's a service that's been running so

62
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,260
we're not experimenting it's not a

63
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,169
[Music]

64
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:45,680
science project and that particular

65
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:48,740
application is video interpretation for

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,120
deaf and hard of hearing so it's a relay

67
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,940
service during person calls definitely

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:02,560
user and that call gets routed if your

69
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:12,890
mic is off okay

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:14,540
is that the right on how about now so

71
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:22,690
now that I finished with the things that

72
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:25,670
I don't want recorded so yeah so yeah

73
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:29,240
you know it's a very basic call flow the

74
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,060
only thing is today those video phones

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,280
that the users have are for all intents

76
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:39,050
and purposes proprietary either

77
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,239
proprietary hardware or maybe a standard

78
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,010
platform but with proprietary software

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,200
on it we think the time is right to come

80
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,500
up with a standard interface and a

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,510
globally standard interface because

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,050
these are services that are not limited

83
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:59,840
to the United States there are other

84
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,050
countries that would like to offer

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,299
similar services and you can imagine the

86
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,930
protocol mechanisms actually could be

87
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,400
useful for other scenarios my

88
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,110
understanding is our Charter is limited

89
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,359
to this particularly use case so it's

90
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,330
very nice to have a concrete thing to

91
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:23,770
look forward to but I guess my point is

92
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:28,219
this work as broad international impact

93
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:32,169
and that we have the tools we all have

94
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,460
sip and not WebRTC and language tags and

95
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,250
here's an interesting one

96
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,159
after much hemming and hawing we've just

97
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,500
gotten the vendor community to maybe

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,870
consider SRTP

99
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,270
whereas I think if we develop something

100
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,790
here in the ITF things like that would

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:55,520
probably be table stakes so again

102
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:59,450
looking forward to a lot of refinements

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:04,010
and help in coming up with a good ITF

104
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:07,070
quality standard it is worth noting if

105
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:12,230
you're thinking again is this a science

106
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:15,980
project the FCC runs or you know through

107
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:18,560
one of our contractors runs some pretty

108
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,200
significant Interop testing so there are

109
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,000
already interoperable it can be put

110
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,610
together for this so once we have a

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:32,240
profile we can actually make sure it

112
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:37,190
works so with that does anyone have any

113
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:50,750
questions for me great thank you very

114
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:53,480
much yeah all right now we got a fumble

115
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,140
ones get Henning to present Henning can

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,940
you start your presentation and let's

117
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:04,340
see you should be able to hit the button

118
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:08,990
here can you hear me now

119
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:12,979
yeah there you go okay I know I'm not

120
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,229
pitching or isn't um so let me give you

121
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:18,919
a little bit of history based on what

122
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:21,789
Eric was starting to talk about not so

123
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,789
next slide please

124
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,080
so for most of you are this is old news

125
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,110
and I see there number of people on the

126
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,880
call are in the remote participation

127
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,310
probably a much better qualified to talk

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,320
about it and I am but I will try and I'm

129
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,819
sure they will correct me if I were to

130
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,060
make a mistake

131
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,480
so we use scenario that we've been

132
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:51,829
dealing with a number of years really is

133
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,670
our video relay our services which

134
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:58,820
consists typically I

135
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,430
in its classical form of two models

136
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:06,380
namely one is one shown on the slide

137
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:09,859
where you have a death or speech

138
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:13,310
impaired in some cases user who wants to

139
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:18,320
communicate with a healing only has a

140
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:22,279
classical phone I'm aria only device and

141
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:27,730
does not converse in sign language the

142
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,839
diffuser in an outbound call a contacts

143
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,829
service provider that they have

144
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,050
subscribed to you and then that in turn

145
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:38,839
wings up a hearing person the

146
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,800
interpreter act as a human media

147
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:45,290
translator between ESL sign private

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,329
diffuser captured by a camera which is

149
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,459
then relayed in voice open live

150
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,920
interpreter to be hearing persons and

151
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,579
vice versa of a hearing person's voice

152
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,000
is conveyed in assigned interpretation

153
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:04,250
of the to build a future on a video

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,420
screen I this is been like I said around

155
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,070
for it's somebody gonna be precise date

156
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,959
but more than a decade certainly

157
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:18,019
probably twenty years in one form

158
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:20,180
started out in a 323i and and in devices

159
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:23,690
that you attached to a television set

160
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,540
and then now looks very much like a

161
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,899
commercial video conferencing and indeed

162
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,599
in many cases is do I'm a commercial

163
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:36,019
you're conferencing product with some

164
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,339
RPC type of model a next slide please

165
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:43,100
I will point out this is not directly

166
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:49,130
relevant to run but it does and aquavit

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:52,550
to some extent is I mean us video

168
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,470
services video relay services use two

169
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,040
databases one which are familiar

170
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,470
database technology that probably one

171
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,740
could argue probably has the largest use

172
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,110
in video relay service after it is not

173
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,940
quite caught fire elsewhere namely enum

174
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,520
so there is an enum database

175
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:18,180
a traditional 10-digit telephone number

176
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:22,800
to a gateway address which is then

177
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:25,920
service but a subscriber or not so that

178
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,260
all the video relay service providers

179
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,300
used out as a mechanism to figure out

180
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,569
where to send Bishop caller in the old

181
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,599
days the H was recalled or not more

182
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,970
recently there is established for a

183
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,850
variety of management purposes primarily

184
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:46,530
to establish eligibility the program has

185
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:49,950
had a history of fraud and other issues

186
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,930
that have occurred surveys the concern

187
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,360
given the high cost of providing the

188
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,870
service at only eligible users users

189
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,440
anyway said accountable surveys a user

190
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:05,430
registration database that uses an HTTP

191
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,170
Jason style query model in a papaya

192
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,810
completely proprietary this

193
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:16,020
unfortunately is not modern I why to

194
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:20,189
bind a telephone number to essentially

195
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,800
my natal URL as well as some management

196
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,970
related information eligibility and so

197
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,189
on why not

198
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:32,370
I'm next slide please one important part

199
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:35,340
and Eric I think alluded to that in one

200
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,090
aspect namely that what we talked about

201
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,520
in Malawi really just while motivated I

202
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:45,420
believe relay service there are actually

203
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:49,110
three different major services that I

204
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,329
used by people who are deaf or hard of

205
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:56,130
hearing and need communication

206
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:59,990
assistance namely a video relay modeled

207
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:03,870
it is focus of our discussion here I

208
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,220
various forms of text we lay and I

209
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,190
what's known as caption telephone

210
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,470
service IPC yes

211
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:16,110
I doubt Eggman's a telephone call by a

212
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,710
human at moment mostly human generated

213
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,070
speech to text a rendition can be used

214
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:26,170
by a person who can

215
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,600
speak I has in audio as well as one

216
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,290
needs assistant understanding the other

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,780
side beyond audio call what I want to

218
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,620
point out for one purposes importantly

219
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,900
that I really if you think of these

220
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,770
three services even though they how many

221
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,569
different user bases for example caption

222
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,430
telephone service is primarily used by

223
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:54,130
late deafened adults

224
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:55,689
I typically elderly are VLS is used by

225
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,120
people who are more part of a deaf

226
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,210
community obviously you have to be

227
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,520
speaking sign language so on from a

228
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,740
technology perspective a really just

229
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,020
combinations of different media so you

230
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,110
can think of it as three different media

231
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,530
audio depending on and going one or both

232
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,070
directions video again one of the true

233
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:22,420
why is typically useful the only two-way

234
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,430
in text going back and forth and you can

235
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,560
essentially construct these relay

236
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,430
services by taking some combination of

237
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,619
these services which means a mime

238
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,030
specification and any devices that

239
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:40,300
implement could well be used for for

240
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:43,030
example some enhanced version of text

241
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,160
relay some enhanced version of caption

242
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,829
telephone service in addition to its

243
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,640
primary use case in video relay service

244
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:56,770
in I will also point out something I

245
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:02,410
forgot to mention and early on probably

246
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:05,290
by use ours the largest user radio relay

247
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,719
service and particularly until recently

248
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,199
when other means like FaceTime and what

249
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,350
papycha applications became available

250
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,010
actually for communication between deaf

251
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:24,000
individuals so they are people who use

252
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:27,189
that as a as a number based on

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,200
universally available as in there's a

254
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,020
expectation that everybody in the United

255
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,329
States has at least potentially access

256
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,089
to video relay service

257
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,769
we and if you know that person's

258
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:40,959
telephone number you can now converse

259
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,269
with that person without having to worry

260
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,199
but we're using whatsapp or FaceTime or

261
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:48,910
Skype or I want every half dozen

262
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,170
different Google options or whatever

263
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,899
else they might use so there's a

264
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,899
point-to-point mode as well as a relayed

265
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,119
mode in that and so but in general all

266
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,299
of the relay services and just to some

267
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:05,379
extent I think should inform our

268
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,199
discussions going forward

269
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:10,089
it is would be quite useful if some of

270
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:14,258
these other relay services could also

271
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:16,029
use the same technology I again that

272
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,850
offers new opportunities for new

273
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:21,999
services we currently don't can't easily

274
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,269
offer because miss stovepipes next slide

275
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:28,329
please

276
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:32,170
I again this is a short version of how a

277
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:37,229
car works it's very much for anybody in

278
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:40,419
the subdomain vain familiar is typically

279
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,419
providers I doubt a connected to each

280
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:45,699
other kept by my eye beam on the

281
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,199
internet generally they don't as far as

282
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:50,589
I know typically don't do private

283
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,689
peeling eye but they establish a secure

284
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:56,139
tunnel of some sort and they query

285
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:58,839
database which operated I knew stored

286
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:01,569
and we turns except domain that returns

287
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:05,169
a second bite and we I was so it looks

288
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:08,579
very much like a inter provider so call

289
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:11,860
to all of us next slide please

290
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,948
so what is the recurring problems that

291
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:18,729
motivate this particular work I for many

292
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:23,679
years I we've had really two problems

293
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:29,049
one initially was that it was difficult

294
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:31,510
on at reasonable quality to make calls

295
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,700
between providers and in the United

296
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,950
States in particular we have a situation

297
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,470
where we have one Bay large provider

298
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,450
that has somewhere around eighty percent

299
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,200
market share in a number of smaller

300
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,510
providers divide remainder I sometimes

301
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,250
users

302
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,770
multiple providers for any number of

303
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:54,929
reasons I and like in any amend I there

304
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,549
is a challenge initially to provide

305
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,340
interoperability particularly at

306
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:02,070
equivalent video quality as in you might

307
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,168
get better quality if true if the two

308
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,149
participants in the call particular for

309
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:10,230
point-to-point calls were using the same

310
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,510
provider versus local item and not that

311
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,910
problem as was alluded to be

312
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:19,530
interoperability test seems to be

313
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:22,049
largely solved I worry some prodding by

314
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,600
the FCC along the way to make everybody

315
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:29,730
play nice or at least pretend to play

316
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:32,760
nice I'm and what is remaining problem

317
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:37,169
that LOM addresses is the ability to

318
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,610
take a usually and among services so

319
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,130
what you might call device supporting

320
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,418
our part we leave software in many cases

321
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,730
these days not a physical device I in

322
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,760
namely a user and operability currently

323
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:55,429
every service even though they're often

324
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:59,299
based on SEP often using fairly familiar

325
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:03,150
technology that we all have seen that a

326
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:06,330
standards-based at least mostly you

327
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:10,440
cannot take a device that you acquired

328
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:12,990
through provider a to provider B if you

329
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,090
happen to use two providers you you have

330
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,260
to use two pieces of software just like

331
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,850
we face member says what's up that one I

332
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,040
so that software is currently provided

333
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,610
for free and I put that intentionally in

334
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,520
quotation marks because it is free to be

335
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,799
user but as I mentioned this is a

336
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,100
subsidized service of a service which is

337
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:38,100
provided by a mine they pay us like you

338
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,730
I at least if you are in the United

339
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,980
States I to VLS users and so the cost of

340
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,010
equipment is a stripling a small

341
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:51,090
fraction about as well I'm we have an

342
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:53,490
idea that motivates i money is is a

343
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,389
small market if my recollection is

344
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,279
collect and Eric and time in were more

345
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,320
up to

346
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:04,909
or correct numbers 300,000 users I'd I

347
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,460
used video relationship it's best far

348
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,960
more users for captioned telephone

349
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:14,119
service I

350
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:17,629
but for reversion of video relay service

351
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:30,399
it is a small relatively speaking a

352
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:33,369
small we I'm getting I'm being heckled

353
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:42,349
now we're we're okay here

354
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:47,389
okay see if I can hone it so the problem

355
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:51,889
is it's relatively small market I used

356
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:54,830
her much further and the talk with

357
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:59,869
providing innovative user feature new

358
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:04,218
platform since on his spelling of her

359
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:07,519
example yeah sorry

360
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:24,859
he just lost it we'll see if he'll come

361
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:46,729
back well we'll see if he come back we

362
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:48,678
are not doing just know we'll give them

363
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:55,989
a couple minutes and if not we'll move

364
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,989
on come back yeah maybe

365
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:14,039
he's still on the list yeah but he's not

366
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:22,449
all right can you see me do you hear me

367
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:24,099
now yes we can hear you handing out that

368
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,559
good sorry I'm I don't know what's went

369
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:31,570
on I just we loaded so we have some web

370
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:34,389
RTC issues as suppose I'm and it's in

371
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,700
any event I we want to support

372
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:40,059
additional platforms beyond typically

373
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,879
Mac and PC is common today and some

374
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:47,109
mobile platforms typically Android iOS

375
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:51,119
but some specialty platforms iOS I can

376
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:55,109
bet you think of things like some of the

377
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:59,589
emerging in-home platforms like that

378
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:01,449
like Facebook and Google and Amazon and

379
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:04,509
so on that offer video screens and

380
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:07,419
cameras and some extent you can't really

381
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:10,509
easily add that all right if Google or

382
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,359
Facebook or Amazon wanted to do so one

383
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:16,419
interesting one that is not as discussed

384
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,460
as frequently is I for a number of

385
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:21,179
reasons people want to switch providers

386
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:25,539
on a call by call basis so this could be

387
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,710
because calls fail I evil because their

388
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:30,969
long wait times

389
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:32,529
this is humans and versus effectivity so

390
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:35,529
you might have to wait while to get a

391
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,359
call I interpret interpreter people

392
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:40,210
might want to try some other service or

393
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:43,509
just because they're failures as in kind

394
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:46,539
of my version of that I probable cause

395
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:48,879
and also people have multiple numbers

396
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:52,929
for incoming calls for any number of

397
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:54,968
reasons again I think the ability to try

398
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,039
out new services whatever and they would

399
00:23:54,969 --> 00:24:00,700
it would be nice to have at all coming

400
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,999
in on one device as well ok next slide

401
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,999
please

402
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,209
ok

403
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,419
the sorry for interoperability cake

404
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,600
version are in not so we have the basis

405
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:16,999
a plate namely we need to unite and I

406
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,759
find we'll talk about those in detail I

407
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:23,419
will have the vagus sip options that

408
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,029
need to be defined I clearly have to

409
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:30,019
deal with media types are in the middle

410
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:32,480
then it gets a little more in the past

411
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,730
at least contentious as to whether that

412
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,649
should be part of it not and these are

413
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:40,309
things that have fall outside in many

414
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:44,059
cases I could have standard voice of IP

415
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:46,490
enterprise text I NAT aversive really

416
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:49,029
doesn't on but configuration retrieval

417
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,919
as we all know we've never managed to

418
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:56,240
create standardized sip configuration to

419
00:24:51,919 --> 00:25:00,409
do anybody actually uses I ng namma one

420
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,769
number one calls a mandatory to support

421
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:09,710
feature for every service that offers

422
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:14,450
video relay services and I'm so then and

423
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:16,940
I portray on top are then services like

424
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,629
video and voice mail that of a common

425
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,789
putting a video mail for the relay I

426
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:24,519
address the portability I want to be

427
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:28,789
able to port my address book across

428
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:30,470
services to avoid capture and things

429
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,690
like speed owl and severe a number of

430
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,809
services that have become common but I

431
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,960
currently tied to a provider next slide

432
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,960
please

433
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:43,610
so I won't go through that in great

434
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,580
detail I it's this is an incomplete

435
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,678
timeline and I to in some extent because

436
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,879
I I don't have the precise stage so

437
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:56,419
don't take this too literally I but I

438
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:59,178
generally we've tried for roughly seven

439
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,950
years now are to work on this problem we

440
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:03,679
collectively when people who have been

441
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,570
interested in video relay service so one

442
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,119
of the first attempts that started I

443
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:11,749
believe roughly in September 2012

444
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:15,889
I accept form actually created a task

445
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:18,070
group I Dodd addressed to problems but

446
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:21,570
ended actually only

447
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:24,490
being one of us the FCC had a major

448
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,159
document codified some of these

449
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,830
interoperability issues mitre got

450
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:33,460
involved eyeing as well an inbound call

451
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:36,220
on one of the participants I nod I a

452
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,850
contract was led to a company called BTC

453
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,560
secure to build a prototype a production

454
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:46,300
system for what it was called data p.i

455
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:50,830
video access telephony reference

456
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,629
platform I a visit forum published a

457
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,820
provider's profile for interoperability

458
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,830
between providers which has been with

459
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,629
subject of easy interoperability tests

460
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,980
that Eric mentioned earlier and that I

461
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,350
might or has been taking a much more

462
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,810
active lead in this particular effort it

463
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:11,199
was an early draft that I helped work on

464
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:14,740
and I called draft yes we dispatch that

465
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,550
kind of started and then hasn't really

466
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:22,240
met made any progress i'm but is around

467
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:25,600
for people to look at i the video relay

468
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,560
providers have been somewhat I've made

469
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,090
the standardization effort has have been

470
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,470
let's say in some cases contentious

471
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,760
let's I'll leave it at that

472
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:39,100
I'm Erin there's actually in January

473
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:43,000
mitre has released as I could help a

474
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:46,000
version of RPE that implements many of

475
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,340
these standards here and that you can

476
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,550
download and I've not tried it myself

477
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:57,879
but leaves ones and windows only I but

478
00:27:51,550 --> 00:28:00,280
that's separate done and then I as Eric

479
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,080
mentioned there is a separate effort

480
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,629
that actually attracted a number of

481
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,730
people interested in video relay but is

482
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,250
not meant to was not meant to be

483
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,680
exclusive to that namely called the

484
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,240
interoperable video calling group as

485
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,730
part of a North American Numbering

486
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,730
Council a report for that group is

487
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:27,520
pending but if you're interested in that

488
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:30,119
you can I'm getting echo again you're

489
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,729
you're sounding fine okay so far

490
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,099
okay it said it gives me some error

491
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:38,339
message that I have to request for floor

492
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:46,589
again you've got the floor keep talking

493
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:48,599
okay and in any event I we in Taupo were

494
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:50,668
really calling group one particular

495
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,168
aspect as far as I can tell and you know

496
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:54,719
it may or may not be at liberty to

497
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:59,189
discuss what real I mean what a real

498
00:28:54,719 --> 00:29:01,949
motivation was is used to please for

499
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:05,629
more video you know stud was not which

500
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:08,189
we anticipated is communication between

501
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:15,089
people who are otherwise not eligible

502
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:19,619
for relay and see if we connected lost

503
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:23,938
connection you started deteriorating in

504
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:25,458
them now you sound all right now now

505
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:41,609
he's gone

506
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:46,319
he sounds terrific let me see now I'm

507
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:48,359
back yeah I'm sorry about that I don't

508
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,389
think it's my problem because I have an

509
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:57,688
on average 10 gigabit connection to the

510
00:29:51,389 --> 00:30:00,599
Internet so in any event I we see one of

511
00:29:57,689 --> 00:30:04,229
the use cases that was brought up is

512
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:08,789
that there are a number of entities now

513
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:10,859
that are not eligible for I use of video

514
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:15,449
relay service namely people who are

515
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:19,349
hearing but speak ASL Eva because there

516
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:22,739
are friends or relatives I or teachers

517
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:25,468
or whatever people who are deaf or in it

518
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:28,229
this is an increasing use case of direct

519
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:29,819
video connection namely we are entities

520
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:32,699
such as for Social Security

521
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:35,908
Administration or large telecom carriers

522
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:40,079
or large financial institutions want to

523
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:42,959
hire people who speak ASL I to

524
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:46,289
communicate way mine Bayard use a base

525
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:48,119
of people who are deaf that without

526
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:51,629
involving an interpreter and that's in

527
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:54,178
everybody's interest because I the

528
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:56,188
people who the calling person gets

529
00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:01,529
better service and going through an

530
00:30:56,189 --> 00:31:03,839
interpreter and I relay fun saves lots

531
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,639
of money because it's many of a calls

532
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,489
that are currently we find a debt

533
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:12,748
accompli paid for actually go to not

534
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:14,819
Yuma not person to private person type

535
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:18,179
of communication but many of us our call

536
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:21,959
center type applications so ROM in

537
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,909
particular is likely and this goes back

538
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:26,279
to the alternate platforms is

539
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,279
particularly useful for those type of

540
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,649
scenarios namely we are the end system

541
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,099
is not in a home but it's actually in a

542
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:37,379
dying call center for Comcast or I mine

543
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,458
so it like I said be a Medicare or

544
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:41,879
something like that

545
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:44,639
we are those calls get handled and they

546
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:48,869
need to be integrated into a call outing

547
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:51,359
system into an IVR type of system to

548
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:52,918
make that integration feasible and my

549
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,259
two in particular has been working on

550
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,199
some prototypes in that and I believe

551
00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:00,269
there's some initial implementations in

552
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:06,329
practice actually of direct video

553
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:10,159
calling okay next slide please read that

554
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:15,649
ice next slide please

555
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:20,639
we are looking at the the Charter for

556
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:23,658
sip form VRS okay that's not appealing

557
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:27,059
on my screen okay that's interesting

558
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:28,909
yeah it on our version of the Medeco

559
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:32,819
thing so

560
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:36,419
sounds like an I'll keep on talking and

561
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:38,009
this is just for reference this was the

562
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:42,599
original charter I don't want to belabor

563
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:45,239
it simply indicates that I rum is

564
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,879
essentially in one like completing a

565
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:50,699
charter that we did support sip form did

566
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:55,809
not quite complete in 2012 because it

567
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:59,080
deals wavy I user agent as well

568
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:01,030
next slide please again this is just for

569
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,320
reference to illustrate the tasers

570
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:07,059
interoperability profile I'm again

571
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,539
mostly for people haven't looked at it I

572
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:13,928
and clearly what we want to do should be

573
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:14,350
compatible with that I'm next slide

574
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,380
please

575
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:18,939
I we video relay service

576
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,539
interoperability events take place

577
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:26,970
regularly I believe the last one was in

578
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:30,940
April of his year and there is a

579
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:33,820
copy-paste state who report about in

580
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:36,520
particular I on the right hand side you

581
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,260
see that there are number of new items

582
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,168
not also for the interoperability

583
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,360
profile between providers such as stir

584
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:44,789
shake and geolocation for an mo one

585
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,709
called

586
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:54,429
and encryption or not so there's ongoing

587
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:58,360
work is an extension going on for IB

588
00:33:54,429 --> 00:34:00,429
inter problem provider profile that I'm

589
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,570
sure will be discussed and the final

590
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:07,659
slide I there are a number of related

591
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,000
efforts ongoing as in related broadly

592
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:13,510
speaking a system level operability

593
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,020
interoperability profiles mostly for

594
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:20,889
carriers and PBX is most of us are from

595
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,949
I worship connect I specified exit

596
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:27,550
features and codecs done days the IP n

597
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:30,040
and I add as IP n and I for voice I doc

598
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,800
says they expect that I'm not a familiar

599
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,800
way Y bar you see clearly has codecs and

600
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,790
and this is probably one that many of us

601
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,619
are not as familiar whoa and I admit

602
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,029
lack of familiarity until I did a little

603
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:46,810
bit of digging and I'm still not quite

604
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,210
sure and I fully understand it so ah CSV

605
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:53,020
which communication system not now I

606
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:58,030
seems to get some traction I because of

607
00:34:53,020 --> 00:35:01,390
one large vendor of handset software I

608
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:04,930
dug is you has a number of

609
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:07,779
interoperability profiles government of

610
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,160
voice and video and they have been

611
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,220
evolving relatively

612
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,598
quickly as in I've seen versions that

613
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,569
are just a few months old

614
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,369
I seem to be much more fleshed out and I

615
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:21,308
remember seeing I'm so there's a bunch

616
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:23,319
of profiles indicate for example set

617
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:25,210
options in the early media and all the

618
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:29,230
stuff that you see on the right-hand

619
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,599
side when I copy pasted the table of

620
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:35,200
contents of one particular effort namely

621
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,970
for video vio 9404 although specs are

622
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,700
publicly accessible I didn't have to do

623
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,890
anything special to get that so it seems

624
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,509
like that's another source of related

625
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,420
information that would be helpful to

626
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,549
consider it would be mine this is my

627
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,010
editorial it would be nice if it

628
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:54,970
wouldn't be too difficult to bridge

629
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:58,299
between the rum world and the LCS world

630
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,328
even if they're not bit compatible but

631
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:04,839
if at least Gateway a ball without doing

632
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:07,180
media translations or about having to

633
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:12,160
munch call flowers too much in that

634
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:17,319
that's all I had and that's great any

635
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:36,399
discussion questions thank you very much

636
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:38,529
Henning okay full disclosure I've been

637
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,529
the editor of the theorist provider

638
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:47,200
profile the first version and there's a

639
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:51,520
new version in progress the new version

640
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,038
will have SRTP so there's this draft out

641
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,400
there that was put out to start

642
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,770
discussion of this work group and and

643
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,329
I'm working on an update to it which I

644
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,660
hope actually I will have out before the

645
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:07,839
meeting is over I wanted to talk about

646
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,819
what's in there this is mainly a table

647
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,400
of contents discussion rather than the

648
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:15,220
detailed stuff I asked you to read the

649
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,349
the draft and comment on it I did get

650
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,970
some comets from Ollie which I very much

651
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:21,309
appreciate and I'm going to incorporate

652
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,330
all that I can of that into this next

653
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,950
version and

654
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:26,140
start discussion on the few items that I

655
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:31,600
wasn't exactly sure how exactly we

656
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:34,150
wanted to handle it but if others could

657
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,520
could read the draft and think see

658
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:40,240
whether what they think of it that would

659
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,100
be really great so the top level table

660
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,589
of requirements go into some generic

661
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:48,630
requirements it just lists it's

662
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:53,950
basically The Hitchhiker's Guide stuff

663
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:56,320
you must do all of these are C's there's

664
00:37:53,950 --> 00:38:00,250
a section on signaling which includes

665
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,050
creating a call mid call stuff ending a

666
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,940
call that kind of stuff there's a

667
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,640
section on media which currently has

668
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,860
specific guidelines in the new version

669
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,930
it will reference the web RTC media

670
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,930
specs that's one of the things I'm doing

671
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:20,259
the SRT P&S rtcp things are there which

672
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:23,470
also probably will get subsumed if we

673
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,830
pick up all those the web RTC specs will

674
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:28,089
probably pick up most of that also

675
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,740
following the discussion that Henning

676
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,840
brought up about wanting to have profile

677
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,009
stuff to beyond the simple signaling

678
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,330
stuff there's a section in there about

679
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:40,230
contacts and then there's a something

680
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:42,910
that deals with at least an aspect of

681
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,860
voicemail and then there's a section

682
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,180
that deals with provider provisioning

683
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,040
and provider selections I'm going to go

684
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,230
into some of this in a little bit more

685
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,660
detail so the sip signaling includes a

686
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,430
registration session establishment with

687
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,799
normal calls there's something that's

688
00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:02,440
specific for VRS in there that has to do

689
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,600
with having a video endpoint connected

690
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,170
to one provider and then using another

691
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,400
provider for a particular call for that

692
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,590
to use their interpreters for a

693
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,280
particular call that's called dial round

694
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:17,610
and there's discussion in there about

695
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:23,220
short-circuits signaling for that

696
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:25,540
there's how you specify from in to

697
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,589
section on incoming calls and a section

698
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,450
on emergency calls

699
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,270
there's mid call signaling which is very

700
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,470
short doesn't really say a whole lot

701
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,190
says you got to handle refer and a

702
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:38,950
couple of other things

703
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:41,440
um it has a section on exactly how we

704
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,509
handle phone numbers and has the section

705
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,030
on unnatural versal which says don turn

706
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,770
and again we'll probably make sure that

707
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:52,540
we're in in compliance with whatever

708
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:54,839
exactly web RTC says on that the media

709
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:58,349
section as I said currently gets into

710
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:03,400
specifics but it'll probably get display

711
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:05,800
replaced but it does cover real-time

712
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,670
text RFC 4103 real-time text video

713
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,210
currently uses h.264 audio currently

714
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:15,550
says 711 with a couple of other options

715
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:18,910
DTMF says the obvious things and s DP is

716
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:23,140
pretty pretty simple deals with some of

717
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:26,410
the privacy issues involved you've got

718
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,270
to deal with features packet loss

719
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,759
indicator and it meant specifically for

720
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,980
video full intra-frame request features

721
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,040
so there's currently text there once

722
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,190
again probably be impacted by the WebRTC

723
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,109
specs which have equivalent mechanisms

724
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,609
but that's what's in that current one in

725
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:44,049
the contacts section in the current

726
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,970
document it actually describes two

727
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,900
mechanisms one is a file based upload

728
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:52,720
and download of of j-card

729
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:57,220
and then it uses carddav to do a sync of

730
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,379
those functions provisioning basically

731
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,439
is download of adjacent object it

732
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,480
defines the object also provides a way

733
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,730
for consumers to have a single device

734
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,280
that can register to multiple providers

735
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,920
and so it can select which provider it's

736
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,690
using and includes the schemas for those

737
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,339
things so we get to decide whether we

738
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,609
want to use this document as a basis for

739
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:23,589
our work we get to decide of that which

740
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:28,509
sections we want to keep in which we

741
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:31,270
want to change and and so this is just a

742
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:34,300
draft it has no special significance but

743
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:37,259
it does really introduce the kind of

744
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,640
ideas that we have and I will put out a

745
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,510
as I say I'm going to put out a revision

746
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:45,220
incorporating the comments and including

747
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,720
the at least the first pass of WebRTC

748
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,450
references instead

749
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,580
the current media specs and then I'm

750
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:55,960
going to ask that we adopt this as a

751
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:59,259
working group item so that's that's

752
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:03,210
where we are and as I say you can expect

753
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:05,849
to see this revision of the document

754
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:08,260
hopefully before the end of this week I

755
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:11,890
get enough time and don't have any other

756
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,390
things in the way but I really would

757
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,589
appreciate any other reviews people want

758
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,759
to do in the current document which I

759
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,480
will incorporate in the next version

760
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,590
that'd be helpful but otherwise that's

761
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,500
that's where we are

762
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:29,190
thanks John

763
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:32,170
it sounds like it yes yes oh yes so one

764
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:35,230
tricky thing what you said is that I

765
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,210
believe WebRTC does not include and

766
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,940
browsers do not support real-time text

767
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:42,160
right it's an important issue thank you

768
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,050
for bringing that up so actually there

769
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,990
is a spec but it says use the data

770
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:48,990
channel and that would really be an

771
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:52,509
issue for backwards compatibility with

772
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,189
existing devices and forwards

773
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:58,390
compatibility with devices that are not

774
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:02,200
specifically WebRTC we're talking about

775
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:05,379
real-time text which is not a high data

776
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,598
rate issue so the notion of transcoding

777
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:12,250
from one form of it to another is not an

778
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,980
onerous task I personally just again

779
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:16,900
this is my personal hat on been working

780
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:22,300
on this for a while my personal hat says

781
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:25,480
do the standard sip RTP based 4103 not

782
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:28,420
the WebRTC in the data channel 4104

783
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,400
real-time text so that would be my

784
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,740
intention for that

785
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:37,450
does anybody implement the real-time

786
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:40,319
text over data channel in the I don't

787
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,319
know if anybody's done it yet

788
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,129
Adam Roche I I wouldn't know either it's

789
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,710
not something we would do it's something

790
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:51,190
that a application that runs inside a

791
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,420
browser context would implement it all

792
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,950
right because it's in the data channel

793
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,690
it's not part of the browser itself

794
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,098
exact that the story it's something

795
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,970
that's pretty trivial to implement on

796
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:01,280
top of it I mean the answer it's

797
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,290
might be no now and if you give me 15

798
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,800
minutes I could say yes instead yeah

799
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,180
it's about that simple but I concede

800
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,560
that it's not the sort of thing you want

801
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,290
to be pushing down into terminals that

802
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,200
aren't otherwise implementing data

803
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,910
channel stack right yeah so I think that

804
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,250
the right decision is going with the SIP

805
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:22,120
approach your point about transcoding

806
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:25,130
being very cheap as a salient one and

807
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,330
perhaps there can be you know some

808
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,510
interest fostered in putting these

809
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,040
things speaking no hats whatsoever not

810
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,810
even you know related my employer but

811
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,130
perhaps there can be some interest

812
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,940
fostered in implementing this sort of

813
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,490
thing if it's a straightforward

814
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,700
application and gets relatively well

815
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,660
deployed yeah that'd be interesting

816
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,620
recognising the DRS services are not

817
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:48,009
like a huge section of the boy yeah yeah

818
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:52,150
but there's the thing is that there are

819
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:55,370
there I'm aware of a couple of groups of

820
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,980
folks who have been writing code for

821
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:00,560
deaf users in there's a couple

822
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:03,830
university groups that have students who

823
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,160
who hack and the notion that we might be

824
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,540
able to get a project going which does

825
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,490
web RTC and the data channel

826
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,820
implementation for those guys who want

827
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:17,209
it plus an inter work to a standard 4103

828
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:19,070
that's a student size project you could

829
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,620
you could give that to a student and say

830
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:24,410
hey do this or a group of students in an

831
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:27,020
in an open source environment it's not a

832
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,580
bad idea and we might want to interest

833
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,170
one of those guys one of those groups

834
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,400
and seeing if they could get like

835
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,740
something like that going and be pretty

836
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,210
interesting to do that so that's a

837
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:38,779
that's actually a very good idea we'll

838
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:44,720
see if we can get that happen uh yes

839
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:47,930
Bernard let's an open source library

840
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,370
called RTC lab which takes contributions

841
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,500
so if you wanted to do that student

842
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,750
project that might be a venue for doing

843
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,940
it that'd be great thank you for

844
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,160
mentioning that and if you wouldn't mind

845
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,210
sending me an email so I don't forget it

846
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,330
okay sure

847
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:08,450
thanks any other questions thank you for

848
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:13,660
bringing it up the very important thing

849
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,660
how many people here have present threat

850
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:23,499
good great oh and he's in the queue yeah

851
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:26,869
let's do Chris first and then Hanna oh

852
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:30,169
yeah he's okay yeah Chris first then

853
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:32,029
Henning Chris when I was curious and I

854
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:34,269
don't remember if we talked on the list

855
00:46:32,029 --> 00:46:38,089
or in the last meeting about

856
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:40,160
authentication giving out sip

857
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:43,038
credentials is something we generally

858
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,779
wouldn't do like md5 username and

859
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:48,140
password it would be more associated

860
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:50,029
with and I and I saw in the draft right

861
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:54,890
now right it's pretty primitive now

862
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:57,559
right yeah yes that has been brought up

863
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,328
in another environment I mean this draft

864
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,700
didn't come out of thin air it's been

865
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:04,130
discussed for a while and it and it came

866
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,049
up and we're gonna have to that isn't

867
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:10,749
gonna fly in the ITF that it's not

868
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:13,609
secure enough to do that yeah no it's

869
00:47:10,749 --> 00:47:16,249
thank you I'll make sure we get that in

870
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:17,930
the notes and I will I will least put a

871
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:23,629
note that says we know this isn't good

872
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:32,868
enough we need to change it so Hennings

873
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:38,269
in the queue I mean okay I mean yes okay

874
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:40,549
so the question I have is how much what

875
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:43,549
you do actually application is she just

876
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:46,369
made how much or you go on a

877
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:49,999
configuration between evil wolf

878
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:51,890
extensible and standard yeah you kind of

879
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:55,058
broke up there but the question you had

880
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,589
was about about confuse or configuration

881
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:59,749
he was bringing up the specific problem

882
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:03,380
of the the current thing has username

883
00:47:59,749 --> 00:48:08,988
and password in in files so we need to

884
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:11,029
change that but I I do hope again we all

885
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:12,499
get to decide how much what the what's

886
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:17,569
in this document the current document

887
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:19,939
does have a mechanism for configuring

888
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:21,739
the endpoint that's a standardized

889
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,380
makanan for configuring the endpoint

890
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:25,900
that's as I say a download of a JSON

891
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,430
object it's no more complicate

892
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,350
than that just defines a schema for a

893
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:34,540
JSON object you download it your device

894
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:37,150
is configured but we we I do hope that

895
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:39,900
we refine that in several ways one of

896
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:43,390
which being the authentication mechanism

897
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,920
for James Hamlin can clarify that Rama

898
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,450
is a user end point interface

899
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,980
whereas access from call centers and

900
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:51,069
other video platforms of network in

901
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:54,550
network interface this is a user this is

902
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:56,980
a uni not an N and I this this this the

903
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:00,010
charter of this workgroup is a uni

904
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,860
interface it's not an N and I network to

905
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:05,500
network interface that is what the PIP

906
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:09,610
is that's what other there are others

907
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:11,560
the IVC document that are IVC work that

908
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,050
Henning was mentioning that was another

909
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,690
example of an nni interface this is not

910
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:20,860
one of those this is a uni interface and

911
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:25,140
and it's device and a user device to

912
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:31,090
provider not provider to provider so

913
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:35,080
Paul the the stuff mitre is doing if

914
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:39,010
part of and part of it is to act like a

915
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:42,670
provider interface the NNI interface of

916
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:46,630
the providers and then connect to UT

917
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:50,850
users that are not DEP user so this is

918
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:53,560
Brian and and as as Henning mentioned

919
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:55,810
the FCC is contracted with mitre to do

920
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,259
interoperability testing they have an

921
00:49:55,810 --> 00:50:03,790
endpoint which meets a version of this

922
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:08,050
this document that I did

923
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:11,770
that's called VAD R P dat RP in order to

924
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:14,020
test that they test it through their own

925
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,420
provider interface so that they're using

926
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,190
the provider to provider interface is

927
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,830
the interface point to test that

928
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:24,220
endpoint and then they make a call to

929
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:29,500
another providers endpoint on that but

930
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:31,660
so they you they yes mitre has a a test

931
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,280
provider interface that implements the

932
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,350
pip the provider to provider interface

933
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,520
but that's just for the test environment

934
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:42,430
the the VAD RP is just a user interface

935
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:46,330
it's a it's a it's a currently it's

936
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:49,450
based on you know wind phone and and

937
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:52,600
it's it just does what a user device

938
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:54,520
would be I think James point is that if

939
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:58,779
you want to have a call center full of

940
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:02,500
people you know you know at Medicare or

941
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:05,230
something that can sign and you deal

942
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,300
with deaf deaf people you can get a

943
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,070
bunch of devices that conform to this

944
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,030
but they've got to connect to so they

945
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,590
would have to connect it with they

946
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:15,010
either have to connect to one of the

947
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:16,780
existing providers right or else you

948
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:21,190
know for which there are currently not

949
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:24,490
really right regulations yeah that right

950
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:28,180
okay and or alternately you got to have

951
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:30,189
some other entity that does support the

952
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,620
anti interface with the providers

953
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:34,480
correct right next to those right voices

954
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,150
but all of that sound of scope for this

955
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,720
work I mean someone could build such a

956
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:42,790
system actually writer has a system like

957
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,189
that but it doesn't use it doesn't use

958
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:50,170
an interface like like the VAT RP or

959
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:52,270
some thing it uses a web RTC but it the

960
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:55,480
that's out of scope for this work right

961
00:51:52,270 --> 00:52:02,440
all that in scope for this work is user

962
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:04,510
device to provider we're just asking a

963
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,250
question you know the answer to so is

964
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:11,550
their source code available and can

965
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:16,360
people go play with it there there is

966
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:19,450
source code available I can't tell

967
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,220
nearest this release process that might

968
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,390
have had to go through to put it out

969
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:29,859
that is the standard lawyer problem I

970
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:31,750
will find out what the URI is and if it

971
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,390
is actually out if a version is actually

972
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:38,440
out I will post it to the list but it is

973
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:40,029
intended that their implementation which

974
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,960
currently is to an early version of this

975
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:44,239
staff standard they are contracted to

976
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,849
come

977
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,439
bleeped up to complete making it be

978
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:50,629
conform it to whatever we come out of

979
00:52:48,439 --> 00:53:03,558
which that will be open-source and

980
00:52:50,629 --> 00:53:07,299
downloadable okay honey I yeah so I just

981
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:11,359
checked Raisa January 2019 release on

982
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:13,788
github for Windows as far as I know and

983
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,098
it's publicly accessible there you go

984
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:18,409
very much the link is on my PowerPoint

985
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:20,179
slides in my notes but I will also post

986
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:24,409
it to a chat room and somebody all you

987
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:26,119
just did alright so yes there is open

988
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,769
source code yes it is available it

989
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,529
doesn't meet this version of the

990
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:33,769
document but it needs a an earlier

991
00:53:30,529 --> 00:53:35,479
version of the document and long term it

992
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:40,189
will meet this document one way or

993
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:43,339
another so somewhat related to the

994
00:53:40,189 --> 00:53:45,138
previous question about the text is

995
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:46,839
there is it do we considered a goal that

996
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:49,309
it should be possible to implement a

997
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:50,749
compliant and blink of Maya this text we

998
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:55,009
generate entirely in JavaScript in a

999
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:56,928
browser in WebRTC so when we were

1000
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:58,519
bashing the Charter for this group there

1001
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:02,929
was a discussion of the compatibility

1002
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:04,758
with WebRTC and earlier drafts of the

1003
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:06,739
Charter had more definitive statements

1004
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:08,629
about that it said that it's desirable

1005
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:10,849
that it do that the current draft the

1006
00:54:08,629 --> 00:54:14,479
current Charter has some text but it's a

1007
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:16,789
little less than that so just again

1008
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:19,098
speaking as a participant not of a chair

1009
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:23,139
I would like that to be possible I would

1010
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:28,249
like you to be able to build a web RTC

1011
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:31,909
server that used at a bug standard web

1012
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:35,089
RTC in the browser client and built a

1013
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:38,149
sip back-end that met the spec and have

1014
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:42,619
it be able to work totally

1015
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:46,159
interoperability with any other VRS

1016
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:48,289
endpoint that met the spec okay so

1017
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,489
that's my goal I want to make sure I

1018
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:51,079
would appreciate

1019
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:52,609
I would appreciate again speaking as an

1020
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,619
individual I appreciate your help and

1021
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:56,899
making sure that we do exactly that

1022
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:57,690
because that's what I want I would like

1023
00:54:56,899 --> 00:55:00,870
that to be

1024
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:03,330
I would like you to be able to build a

1025
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,920
web RTC server that with a sip back-end

1026
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:09,029
that created the interface that meets

1027
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,700
the spec Chris one that should be

1028
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,700
possible and we many of us have probably

1029
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,660
built web RTC thus if gateways so

1030
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:22,230
definitely why it's why it's not

1031
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:23,730
possible right I hope so yeah I get all

1032
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:31,460
the media well that's why one of the

1033
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:33,930
reasons we wanted to do exactly that the

1034
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,670
other comment I wanted to bring up was

1035
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,410
similar to my last one but I guess

1036
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:39,630
related to the provisioning part and

1037
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:42,330
making sure the security like

1038
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:44,790
provisioning devices today is there

1039
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:46,890
isn't a lot of good standards that the

1040
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:49,410
industry conforms to and I wonder if

1041
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,720
that's a challenge we need to take on

1042
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:53,819
here and you know both security of the

1043
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,950
standard you know is their credentials

1044
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:59,280
in that JSON object that we need to

1045
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:01,140
protect from people snooping or other

1046
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,120
things like that I think you're yeah I

1047
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:05,339
think you're exactly right I think that

1048
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,710
if we can't do that then that ought not

1049
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:12,180
to be in the in the in the resulting

1050
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:15,650
draft and I welcome your your

1051
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:18,540
suggestions on how to achieve that but I

1052
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:20,640
mean as many people have noted right the

1053
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,350
ITF has taken several cracks at doing

1054
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,440
provisioning none of which have been

1055
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:27,420
implemented and it would be nice if we

1056
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,270
built something that was implementable

1057
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:32,670
at least by this set of people you know

1058
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:34,110
if it had more generality great but

1059
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:38,010
right now I'm just trying to get it to

1060
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:39,360
work here and and and security is one of

1061
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:46,280
those things that you have to get right

1062
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:52,950
or it won't get implemented so and then

1063
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:55,110
we're relaying for me to go to their

1064
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,730
Janus project it's open source and as

1065
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:58,350
controllable SIF gateway in function the

1066
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:59,730
server will make sure to follow the

1067
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:03,600
evolution of group requirements to see

1068
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:09,190
if this is easy to perfect okay thank

1069
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:13,210
you maybe we can turn me echoing yeah

1070
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:17,400
yeah no gutter gutter

1071
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:19,599
welcome gutter your thang Thanks yes

1072
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:24,790
okay good

1073
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:27,160
this is a good action and I heard Eric

1074
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:31,140
saying that he want it to be a global

1075
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:33,940
action there are a couple of problems

1076
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:39,460
comparing to what we have in Europe and

1077
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:43,780
other places we so far have not really

1078
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:46,420
discussed contacts and also the

1079
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,060
provisioning part so the media and the

1080
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:51,839
SIP are good and good improvement so

1081
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:54,880
over what we have we have an Etsy

1082
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,759
standard for VRS and it's

1083
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,089
interoperability that has the basics but

1084
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:03,130
it doesn't have the security and all the

1085
00:58:01,089 --> 00:58:05,740
improvements you have put into this spec

1086
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:09,190
so I think that would be good for global

1087
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:11,740
use for that case but I don't know how

1088
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:13,920
to handle the contacts and provisioning

1089
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:17,649
maybe we should separate it out in

1090
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:20,500
separate specs which is a problem to

1091
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:24,730
create many rafts but that's a reaction

1092
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:32,920
anyway and the other the hope from

1093
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:36,880
Henning about GSMA the IR 92 and IRR 94

1094
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:39,359
interoperability is in conflict with the

1095
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:46,390
other hope to have web RTC

1096
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:49,529
interoperability so I well the GSMA it

1097
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:56,230
has got its implementation in USA now

1098
00:58:49,530 --> 00:59:02,200
with the real-time text for text relay

1099
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:05,619
and text communication but mmm I just

1100
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:10,328
noticed that conflict that is IMS and

1101
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:15,700
web RTC is not IMS so we need to specify

1102
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:17,800
which way to go so that's my reaction so

1103
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,759
far I read this back and I think it's

1104
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,800
good

1105
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,200
certainly a lot of points to discuss so

1106
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:27,440
look thank you well thank you very much

1107
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,660
and I hope that you'll participate and

1108
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,430
send comments I think he raised two

1109
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,720
specific issues that I didn't want to

1110
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:36,200
address and then we'll go on to the next

1111
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,120
person in the queue we can we certainly

1112
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,299
can split up the document into multiple

1113
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,490
documents if it makes sense I'd like to

1114
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,680
find a problem that we can't solve

1115
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:48,709
relatively quickly before we immediately

1116
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,919
jump into splitting it up I would not do

1117
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,710
it

1118
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,870
that ultimately happens I do hope the

1119
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:56,120
contact thing can sail without a lot of

1120
00:59:53,870 --> 01:00:00,319
work but we'll see

1121
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,910
the provisioning thing as Chris brought

1122
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,150
up has got a bunch of security issues

1123
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:07,430
that there are no obvious answers for so

1124
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,960
may take more work and we may decide to

1125
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:11,810
split it off just because we want to get

1126
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,860
the main spec done without that

1127
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:20,360
III think person again speaking

1128
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:23,870
personally I would like to see the

1129
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:25,520
WebRTC specs be part of standard with

1130
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,480
maybe a statement that said in order to

1131
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,190
achieve interoperability with an IR 94

1132
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,190
compliant and device you would you know

1133
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:36,050
use this subset of that I think it's a

1134
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:40,700
proper subset I don't think that there's

1135
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:42,680
a there's a divergence other than super

1136
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:48,620
setting and sub setting but we'll check

1137
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:51,200
out any seam coming on i-94 I think the

1138
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:53,210
same thing is I I don't think we need to

1139
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,490
emulate everything I just want to make

1140
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:58,070
gate weighing as you said about the

1141
01:00:55,490 --> 01:01:00,229
about you Seagate weighing relatively

1142
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:03,610
straightforward without having to do too

1143
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:05,630
much video another on call flow

1144
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:08,630
rewriting even though it's going to be

1145
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:10,790
ims on one side and more plain sip so to

1146
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:12,650
say on the other side that's relatively

1147
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:15,050
easy to accommodate bear lots I think

1148
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:17,750
there are lots of tools commercial tools

1149
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,850
that do that just if it the call flow

1150
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:23,420
starts looking really different and that

1151
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:26,900
gets really hard in that the second card

1152
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:29,060
on the provisioning part is one of the

1153
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,310
differences that I think might make the

1154
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,640
problem slightly more tractable is that

1155
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:37,000
we essentially have a two stage

1156
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:42,490
visioning model namely users have

1157
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:45,819
identities wave providers and possibly

1158
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:48,160
in the uod I thought you could leverage

1159
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:51,038
and then to encrypt for example

1160
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,690
credentials which are then stored with a

1161
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:55,690
public key private key type of

1162
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:59,130
encryption in in this HTTP which we will

1163
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:02,140
config file so that you don't have to

1164
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:04,720
install individual credentials in each

1165
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:07,269
device for each user so there might be

1166
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:11,019
models for because of a particular

1167
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:13,269
relationship users have providers there

1168
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:16,149
might be a model to essentially do have

1169
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:18,459
some non visible bootstrapping as in

1170
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,500
things that aren't that are beyond the

1171
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,010
scope and was a hard but they're

1172
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,880
different

1173
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:26,230
I thought you can use in that and it

1174
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,760
depends will be dominant providers

1175
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,079
whether they are willing to go or

1176
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,950
something which looks a little bit like

1177
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:35,859
a cloud SSH key type of model or whoever

1178
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:38,649
they are they insist on and just md5

1179
01:02:35,859 --> 01:02:42,369
encoded a - strings that you can

1180
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:43,930
directly copy into a sip register yeah

1181
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:45,970
well I mean I think we'll have to talk

1182
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:47,259
about this and maybe we'll maybe I'll

1183
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,609
start some email threads on the whole

1184
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:50,650
thing and the other possibility is just

1185
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:55,269
do it oh oh off I mean you know that'll

1186
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:57,700
be good enough just have a a primary and

1187
01:02:55,269 --> 01:03:01,680
have credentials stored have everybody

1188
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:06,129
else use you know Oh auth authentication

1189
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:08,649
- to prove who you are maybe it not work

1190
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:12,190
I mean we can explore something like

1191
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:14,200
that Chris wanted both I think is

1192
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,119
something to look at the problem

1193
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,799
sometimes as terminals don't have very

1194
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:20,470
good capabilities so yeah

1195
01:03:17,799 --> 01:03:24,038
entering right username and password

1196
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:26,890
we're just playing an SSO page or yeah

1197
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:28,930
or if you want to do it indirectly like

1198
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:31,000
you go to a browser link and enter your

1199
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:33,129
password and that remotely you know

1200
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,380
those are complex flows that from an

1201
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:38,769
interoperability point of you make may

1202
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:40,630
be difficult so I I think we'll probably

1203
01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:43,058
have to at some point decide just how

1204
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:45,900
far we want to go down whatever rattle

1205
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:45,900
we decide

1206
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:50,940
I think that used to be a bigger problem

1207
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,770
than it is these days the devices people

1208
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,180
are using are more capable but it's

1209
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:57,030
still there are plenty of devices people

1210
01:03:54,180 --> 01:04:03,710
use that our typing passwords is you

1211
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:16,710
know pretty painful any anything else

1212
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:18,930
great please read the draft I didn't

1213
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:21,600
find occurred to me when you mentioned

1214
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:23,220
that European requirements is assumed

1215
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,270
the US service is basically just a

1216
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:29,040
seller English right how do you handle

1217
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:31,290
cases where you've got either multiple

1218
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:33,060
price sign languages or multiple

1219
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,640
possible spoken lines right so so

1220
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:40,620
obviously we want to use the human

1221
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:44,220
langtang we want to say that both you

1222
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:46,529
just buy both both line tags in the in

1223
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:50,009
the invite you know because this is what

1224
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:52,110
I want in in and out and and you get

1225
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:56,220
what you get what you asked for

1226
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,630
I'm you know even today there there are

1227
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,609
our providers that have both an English

1228
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:02,820
cue in us and a Spanish cue or an

1229
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:05,010
English commune of French cue so that

1230
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,210
that problem exists they're there their

1231
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,670
solutions these things are pretty

1232
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:13,710
primitive and we'd like it to be better

1233
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:14,970
but somehow I thought I had that in

1234
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,260
there but maybe I just thought about

1235
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:21,779
putting it in there instead of actually

1236
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:28,080
doing it no no there's an ASL language

1237
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:29,460
tag yeah there is the ASL as long as

1238
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,250
we're all like talking about the US

1239
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:34,830
there's really only one right right but

1240
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,990
human line tag is the way to say Spanish

1241
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:40,230
spot sign language English language

1242
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:45,709
French sign language Swahili sign

1243
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:47,240
language whatever okay great

1244
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,530
anything else people

1245
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,290
to discuss otherwise think we're done

1246
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:58,550
with with our session with regard to the

1247
01:05:51,290 --> 01:06:00,259
call for a job yes let's see we had more

1248
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:03,920
than half a dozen people that have read

1249
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:06,200
this oh yeah yes well let me put the new

1250
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:10,280
version out and coffee adoption ah no

1251
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,839
one yeah and and and we can have list

1252
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,630
discussion make sure that we're okay on

1253
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:17,119
the list and then and then we'll do that

1254
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:19,910
so that's that's kind of the plan will

1255
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,250
will will put out the new version oh one

1256
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:24,049
version let it sit for a while and get

1257
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,340
people though have a chance to look at

1258
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:26,440
it and then we'll call for adoption on

1259
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,780
that on the list

1260
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:53,990
son all right great

1261
01:06:29,780 --> 01:07:01,220
that's the plan thank you yeah I gotta

1262
01:06:53,990 --> 01:07:22,399
be there alright when we started one I

1263
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:28,399
started let's get everybody who hasn't

1264
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:29,869
signed it if you don't want to wait for

1265
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:46,910
that one there I got another one up here

1266
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:49,630
if you want to come up one sign this you

1267
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,629
need to be told
