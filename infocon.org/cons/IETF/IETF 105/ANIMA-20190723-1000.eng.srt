00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:33,489
that's that session starts this

92
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:36,370
afternoon one half okay when given the

93
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:40,120
last four years when the workgroup

94
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,060
already produce only two RFA's but I

95
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,450
will actually finish five documents

96
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:50,680
another sway you're sitting in the rock

97
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:57,310
for the Miss ref but hopefully we have

98
00:07:50,680 --> 00:08:01,480
the CD DL Cooper already in the RFC I

99
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:05,380
believe and the ACP we hope to face it

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,070
this last meeting and get it in the ice

101
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,270
before

102
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:15,159
oh that's already iest but yeah yeah

103
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:18,669
hopefully we will have so within this

104
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:23,110
year to be RFC then that means we can

105
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:28,290
have for at least four RFS competed in

106
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:32,610
this year well that's good yeah

107
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:36,960
we have the ASAP draft

108
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:40,710
or the ASG still has to discuss

109
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:45,590
hopefully that we would be a result

110
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:49,620
racially and we have Brisky and now

111
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:53,130
another round reversed ID did it were

112
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,760
see according to the updates this

113
00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:01,830
weather we did another working group

114
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:06,390

115
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,370

116
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:16,110
to the constraint which are updates this

117
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:19,620

118
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:24,620
information released next meeting in

119
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:30,680
Singapore okay so here we go for the

120
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:35,720
first presentation that's right

121
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,719
should be one where it

122
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,910
as long as the working groups have to

123
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:58,120
have the priority so don't be surprised

124
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,430
if the working group draft report to

125
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,440
take longer time than we planned we

126
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,800
actually have you know should have

127
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,459
sufficient time listen this meeting we

128
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:44,709
after now we have 15 mins spare time you

129
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:49,628
did will and then of Mike Mike sorry for

130
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:54,369
that okay so this is a number so this is

131
00:10:49,629 --> 00:11:04,889
the update for ACP since in 104 we had

132
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:12,519
version 19 and that basically had the

133
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:18,420
answers to the security is G review from

134
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:18,420
Bankhead ook and a request call and

135
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,360
effectively I didn't receive replies for

136
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:29,949
that since last week and since then I've

137
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:34,059
been working to get / 20 posted which I

138
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:37,149
did yesterday and the reason was that a

139
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,040
the the reviews you know it's a very

140
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,500
large document right so basically what

141
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,779
we miss a number of documents we have a

142
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,250
number of pages between brewski and ACP

143
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:50,290
document and so and effectively one ad

144
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,509
had to taste and in four to 80s because

145
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,980
Eric rest collars term expired also

146
00:11:52,509 --> 00:12:00,279
between 104 and 105

147
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,990
so basically been had to jump into the

148
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,730
existing review from

149
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,290
I can take it over and so he did an

150
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,940
excellent job with a lot of details so

151
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,800
that was a lot of work

152
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,330
he was also moving so that was basically

153
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,300
why I took the three-month between 104

154
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:21,300
and 105 to get all the feedback that was

155
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:24,579
done with at the idea of 104 with 19

156
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,599
into you know back to me last week and

157
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:31,000
and and I rested now so there is also

158
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,650
kind of the oversight somewhere between

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,970
me and Elissa in terms of Alyssa's

160
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,750
feedback is the only other outstanding

161
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:43,480
discuss on the iesg and that was

162
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,660
actually closed in August last year in

163
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,450
my opinion with the replying review and

164
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,300
I checked and there was no other reply

165
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,590
from that so I sent a reminder yesterday

166
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,810
as well to basically see if if he also

167
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,330
thinks that that her review and again

168
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,939
are to review from Elwyn is close but I

169
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,830
think that is all not really critical

170
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,960
and should be very quick to do and then

171
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,030
also you know this whole github stuff I

172
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,160
really don't live that so I discovered

173
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,439
very nice things that Michael had

174
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,050
proposed in January and I also pulled

175
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,890
those in so in summary I think the

176
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:26,349
outstanding issues are to discuss from

177
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:27,790
Ben one is about the encoding of the ACP

178
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,180
domain information in the certificate

179
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,010
and the second one is about details of

180
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,930
the security profiles of the different

181
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,520
protocols and that's what we're going to

182
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,989
talk about in the end of the

183
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,240
presentation I quickly wanted to go

184
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,520
through the changes that were done

185
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,250
between 19 and 20 that I hope are

186
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,220
unconscious but interesting and not the

187
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:56,950
hundred others that are on contentious

188
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:59,170
and non interesting so so rework in and

189
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:03,220
and and improve the ACP domain

190
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,870
membership check text because it seemed

191
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,450
to be been unclear whether this is

192
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,740
something that should only rely on

193
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,820
certificate encoding which is defined in

194
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,680
RFC 5280 but rather it really depends on

195
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,279
each individual Association protocol

196
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,050
because

197
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,839
depends on proof of ownership which is a

198
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,550
process done by the security Association

199
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
product called so that's basically

200
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,430
referred to there is more specific

201
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,899
reference to the certificate chain

202
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,998
verification which is actually defined

203
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:35,889
in 50 to 80 when there are certificate

204
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:38,189
chains there was in slash 19 in the ITF

205
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:40,870
104 review also the point about stapling

206
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:44,800
so those things are hopefully now

207
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,959
covered correctly saying that when only

208
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,269
when the security Association protocol

209
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,839
is too weak so that you cannot do you

210
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:56,490
know crl OSC SP with itself then we can

211
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:59,559
skip during the security Association crl

212
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:05,110
verification or CSP and basically do it

213
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:07,089
later on when we get it mm-hmm so and

214
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,649
then there's a new summary at the end of

215
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,240
the section to restate the the

216
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,240
individual purpose with respect to

217
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,220
authentication authorization for each of

218
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,589
these six steps so I'm not going to go

219
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:22,660
into detail on those for the certificate

220
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:26,110
renewal we are been dating the est

221
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:31,329
protocol RFC 70:30 and there's basically

222
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:33,250
the interesting problem of why do we

223
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,769
need actually you know to be able to

224
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,319
identify the est server as a valid est

225
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:42,629
server and if so how do we do it so

226
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:46,589
70/30 was asking to do this by having

227
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:48,910
est servers have the ID KPC and CRA

228
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:53,319
extended attribute in the certificate

229
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:56,319
and so that is also now required here

230
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,290
for EST servers in the ACP there was no

231
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:01,329
good explanation given why under which

232
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,189
circumstances that actually helps as

233
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:06,008
opposed to just having normal ACP

234
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:08,290
certificate and so the justification

235
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,689
that I put in there is that this is

236
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,309
primarily the way I understand it and

237
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,870
that would be good if security experts

238
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,240
would would chime in and tell me if it's

239
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,600
wrong I hope it's not that if you're

240
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,399
actually renewing the trust anchors you

241
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,170
really want to know that whoever gives

242
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,809
you the trust anchors is something more

243
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,149
than the random note in the ACP but that

244
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,959
that is actually somebody who is a

245
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,170
trusted

246
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,270
part of the security chain meaning a

247
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:40,030
real registrar that has the

248
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:42,610
authentication from the CA because in

249
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,560
this certificate renewal case you know

250
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,750
you would already be able to figure out

251
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,540
that it's an attacker because he can't

252
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,540
even give you correct reek heat

253
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,780
certificate so so that was basically

254
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:59,890
those those key parts you if you want to

255
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,400
come in place I mean it's that's what

256
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,050
we're here for

257
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,869
it's called working group not

258
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:10,810
presentation group Michael Richardson

259
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:14,729
the the the the extended key huge stuff

260
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,730
in my mind is is it general

261
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,000
they work for lawyers but because people

262
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,240
that jacket are applying implementations

263
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,410
and people that don't check it can do

264
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,240
whatever they want and they can always

265
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,770
do whatever they want and you know legal

266
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,060
stuff won't change whether they do it or

267
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,860
not I'm putting the bit there won't

268
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,620
change whether they do it or not but the

269
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,719
intention of the CM CRA I think you

270
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,800
could get it right it's it's so that you

271
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,450
know that you are speaking to a

272
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:50,230
representative who can actually enroll

273
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:52,150
you in that specific that specific CA

274
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:57,910
well this is not in Roman right this is

275
00:17:52,150 --> 00:18:02,890
all only renewal enrollment specific

276
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:06,010
thing yeah I don't really understand

277
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:10,690
what the attack it prevents I'm not sure

278
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:13,900
there is one well I'm the rendom RC

279
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,390
70/30 says like you will have that and

280
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,360
5280 says something about it I think -

281
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,040
and that's you have it it's a bit of no

282
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,679
enemies it's not if you are using open

283
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,379
SSL that's not one of the IDs which is

284
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,900
predefined I've had you add it and it's

285
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,960
an added in a way that you you just need

286
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:36,730
a source code update to do it so is

287
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:41,400
annoying front but that's what the spec

288
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,400
says it's right

289
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:50,840
yeah well I think he take his Syria well

290
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,400
I mean I think the attack is that at

291
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,290
some point in time a client figures out

292
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,120
that the trust anchor certificates are

293
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,639
expiring so he's renewing the trust

294
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,429
anchors and if then he gets randomly to

295
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,710
some attacking est server on the ACP

296
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,330
some you know sitting nowhere IOT device

297
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:10,910
that has been intruded how do you

298
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:12,110
prohibit that the attacker has to be a

299
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,010
compromised

300
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:19,909
device that's already enrolled in the CA

301
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:23,600
just okay so and has compromised the

302
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:27,440
network and for now pretending to be has

303
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,540
an identity that matches the something

304
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,950
so it requires a bunch of things that

305
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,409
are not sure that that bit actually

306
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,300
helps you I think it only requires you

307
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,280
to be able to upload some application

308
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,470
software that you know looks like an est

309
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,450
server to such a compromised IOT device

310
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,030
the device already has an ACP

311
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,850
certificate and that's all it needs

312
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,170
right there is no further verification

313
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:55,909
possibilities on

314
00:19:48,170 --> 00:20:04,550
I think non-id device but because I

315
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:05,510
would also well I was coming trying to

316
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,460
come up with the best possible

317
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,260
explanation why it really makes sense to

318
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,910
add exactly that type of code that you

319
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,100
were saying so and if that's actually

320
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,960
you know if nobody can come up with a

321
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,300
good reason I'd rather you know go

322
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,190
against what you know the isg review

323
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,649
said and stick to to simpler software

324
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,230
but basically we'll need to be sure that

325
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,760
really it is not clear that there is

326
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:33,050
actually any attack vector that it

327
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:35,330
prevents okay so right so what what else

328
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,389
that we have so Cerf est grass objective

329
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,840
so Michael suggested we use port 443

330
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:45,050
because est of course is using TLS and

331
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,530
then said also the objective parts that

332
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:51,080
are unknown must be ignored CDP

333
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,410
distribution must really use HTTP not

334
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,800
HTTPS to a boy

335
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,780
circular dependencies and I also added a

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,280
note why dull grass isn't signaling

337
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,110
these certificates because it's

338
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,090
multicast certificates are large that's

339
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:08,129
bad and that's just needed as a

340
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:09,990
dependency for other stuff so there is a

341
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,450
new section as part of the security

342
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,950
review to talk in general about the

343
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,390
security Association product called

344
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,940
requirements independent of what they

345
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,250
are especially important for somebody

346
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,350
who writes a follow-up a security

347
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:27,210
profile with existing protocols or new

348
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:29,040
protocols so first of all I think this

349
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,300
is finally the right place to have the

350
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,220
every statement that we don't need

351
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,909
Network wide MTI because this is all

352
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,560
hop-by-hop we need to be able to signal

353
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,500
the full certificates because we don't

354
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,510
have other off path options to learn

355
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,430
about certificates protocols really love

356
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,550
to have just you know hashes or URL

357
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,740
signal to be efficient by themselves and

358
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,110
all security associations must have

359
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,090
equivalent degree of security to not

360
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,350
create a weakest link because that's the

361
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,790
obvious attack against an ACP and that

362
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,429
doesn't necessarily mean that we need to

363
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,770
have strong crypto encryption at really

364
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:07,860
the security Association at layer 3 but

365
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:11,129
there at least you know two common cases

366
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,199
of exceptions one is the one that we

367
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,240
haven't done work for um that would be

368
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,040
follow-up work is if we have something

369
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,320
like Wi-Fi Mexico or something that at

370
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,090
layer 2 has very strong encryption and

371
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,929
at that point in time we would only need

372
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,879
to figure out a secure Association for

373
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,710
the ACP that leverages that accordingly

374
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,590
and also does ACP you know

375
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,510
authentication as a valid ACP member and

376
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,580
the other one of course is when we have

377
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,260
strong physical security within a data

378
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,040
center in the NOC that's obviously what

379
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,230
we've defined is if we connect for but

380
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,590
this text also now gives some good

381
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:49,170
reasons beyond the fact that you won't

382
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,780
have strong physical security outside of

383
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,880
those constraint places but also that

384
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,889
you can never do this Auto configuring

385
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,630
fully this strong physical security

386
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,460
that's something that really needs to be

387
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,730
defined by policy and that really makes

388
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,980
it not really very useful in general so

389
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:10,700
this is just a workaround really

390
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:12,770
so then there was a section about ripple

391
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,809
routing to unknown destinations which

392
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,260
basically is is a function on the ripple

393
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,639
route to discover wrong traffic and that

394
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,140
was one of been discussed this point

395
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,390
otherwise I thought it was very simple

396
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,610
to resolve so given how we're trying to

397
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,320
have no new forwarding plane

398
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,540
requirements routes would have this

399
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,299
requirement we have this diagnostic so I

400
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,309
wrote up a paragraph that says that you

401
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,080
know devices that can't have more

402
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,418
intelligent functions like not being a

403
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,980
registrar not being able to have ACP

404
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,240
connect and not allowing you to

405
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,860
configure the route at all

406
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,080
those would be devices that don't have

407
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,600
the requirement because whenever those

408
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,980
devices would become the actual route of

409
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,159
a network then all the more intelligent

410
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,020
devices are already gone um and you know

411
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,790
Diagnostics isn't really possible

412
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,980
anymore because the network can't be

413
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:03,980
reached from the outside so grasped via

414
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:08,360
ACP Connect there was a section in the

415
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,190
appendix to say that we should have

416
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,899
Policy filtering and you know during

417
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,580
security review that was kind of

418
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,940
misinterpreted to be a security

419
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:19,428
requirement was really only a service

420
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,200
policy requirement so I I thought it's

421
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:22,880
it's it's it's good and I would still

422
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,919
like it but probably easier to have it

423
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,429
in different text and not here so I

424
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,679
removed that that was an interesting

425
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:34,250
point about the a CPA and AI

426
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,480
configuration that was brought up and

427
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,610
where I figured that actually the

428
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,760
explanation why we must configure in

429
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:43,370
brownfield devices to enable the a and I

430
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,549
as opposed to let it be default it's

431
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,830
really the case where somebody doesn't

432
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:51,410
even know a and is the feature on on

433
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,939
their routers so that that text was in

434
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,980
there but the real attack vector is a

435
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,080
little bit more complicated and I wrote

436
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,700
this down and that's really that if you

437
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,340
don't even know there is a and I and

438
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,040
what a masa is your organization hasn't

439
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,260
also not gotten any you know credentials

440
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,850
to have registrar's connected to the

441
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,250
mass and that typically makes it a lot

442
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,149
easier for identity theft for people to

443
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,530
basically claim oh and this organization

444
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,330
getting access to the masa and then

445
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,350
basically of course being able to attack

446
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,240
you from really what you know

447
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:26,699
masa would consider valid certificates

448
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:29,130
so that's now in their text so then yeah

449
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,350
more text about a CP configuration as

450
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,240
one of the you know hopefully also very

451
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,459
simple you know you just configure one

452
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,000
command and then you can attach in the

453
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:48,600
NOC devices to it the text was was

454
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:50,669
desired should likely so then there's

455
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,309
the section a8 which was talking about

456
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:56,640
the general purpose way to negotiate

457
00:25:53,309 --> 00:26:00,260
across incompatible security

458
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,610
associations more intelligently um with

459
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,799
you know something how to how do you

460
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,139
negotiate between DTLS and IPSec if you

461
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,730
do both and you have certain desires so

462
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,980
that was a very convoluted thing and we

463
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,049
decided already much earlier that that

464
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,690
was too far out that we ever wanted to

465
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:18,809
do this at our at this point in time so

466
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,190
the an output nodes for the RFC editor

467
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,080
in there so that it's not going to be

468
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,460
included in publish means I want to have

469
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,809
all these you know far out thing at

470
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,789
least in the last version of the draft

471
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:28,230
because when people go back and look at

472
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:30,960
the history of the stuff that makes it a

473
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:36,659
lot easier but that's gone and finally

474
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:41,610
some Diagnostics so noting that the idea

475
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:45,450
of ID maybe more insecurity so did I

476
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:49,649
oops I think I forgot to mention huh

477
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:51,990
what was it so then basically Michael in

478
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,809
January had provided really nice text to

479
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,370
improve the way that the ACP addressing

480
00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:00,149
in with the V long where we have so many

481
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,340
bits gets expressed so basically he

482
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,169
introduced you know just there is no

483
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,120
encoding change at all it's just you

484
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:09,000
know this bit that decides whether this

485
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,158
field is 8 or 16 long you have given it

486
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,659
you know it's now a named bit and the

487
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,179
thing better text for that and

488
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,130
ultimately also made a very nice a

489
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,600
picture showing comparison of the

490
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,400
different addressing formats that we

491
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:26,939
have so thank you very much so now let's

492
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,100
get to the real core issues that we

493
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,690
still need to resolve so the first one

494
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,570
is the encoding of the ACP domain

495
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,900
information into the cert

496
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:39,230
it's currently a certificate RFC 822

497
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:42,320
name which is a string and so we encoded

498
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:46,250
it in a human readable form that is RFC

499
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,169
822 compatible summarized it's

500
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,510
something like you know ACP RFC number

501
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:53,240
plus the ACP address plus some options

502
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,879
at the ACP domain and so there are a lot

503
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,890
of reasons cited why we think this is a

504
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,360
good thing backward compatibility is of

505
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:03,890
coding new-new asn.1 so especially I was

506
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,290
you know worried about that you know

507
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,840
whenever I'm doing Diagnostics even

508
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,270
existing programs could show you the ACP

509
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,870
address information without having to be

510
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,770
revved up

511
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,840
so then Ben's discuss was that he was

512
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:20,570
suggesting to use a new other name

513
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,179
encoding point for the IANA and proposed

514
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,300
to one of binary encoding so meaning no

515
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,680
asn.1 structure so my thinking and

516
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,300
that's what I sent back to him and

517
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,740
that's what I'd love to see more

518
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,430
feedback from the working group as well

519
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:38,060
so I think we do always need a human

520
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,980
readable knock bet end to a processable

521
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,389
string as a standard representation so

522
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,540
why do we need two different standard

523
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:47,540
presentations and so something like

524
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,430
local at domain is you know common

525
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,490
identifiers that humans understand for

526
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,810
identities anyhow just our options part

527
00:28:52,490 --> 00:29:13,730
make it a little bit more you know

528
00:28:53,810 --> 00:29:15,470
awkward well I did this last week and I

529
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,360
send it out yesterday so we're talking

530
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:24,530
here so obviously I'll bring it to the

531
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:28,939
list yeah of course not there's there's

532
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:31,340
some the annoyances to it or have

533
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,870
nothing to do with encoding but rather

534
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:39,500
it turns out that your registrar has to

535
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:42,020
allocate because because his certificate

536
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,740
is produced during the enrollment time

537
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:51,280
and it's produced by providing

538
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:55,130
CSR tributes as 7030 tells you to so the

539
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:59,170
new device is now enrolled it's not

540
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:02,480
pledge of does a get on CSR attributes

541
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:07,520
and this is some get it's supposed to be

542
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,470
a tit idempotent right but you have to

543
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,889
return the right to CSR attributes in

544
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:16,090
the width there so you have to allocate

545
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:18,260
the ACP address on an idempotent get

546
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,110
which means that you actually have to

547
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,530
remember that you've allocated it for

548
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:26,629
this device by its white thing and so

549
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,129
that it's word disconnected and

550
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,780
reconnect and should get the same

551
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,000
attributes again and everything would be

552
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,360
happy so that's actually the part that

553
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,180
should that's kind of fragile annoying

554
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:41,870
figuring out how to encode it completely

555
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,930
irrelevant okay there are no libraries

556
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:49,010
and all I don't hear otherwise which

557
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:51,410
return CSR attributes might have to hand

558
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:54,470
coded in the instead one I'm using a

559
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:57,140
said one primitives regardless so that

560
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,240
part doesn't matter anything you like

561
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,760
it's going to be equally hard even if

562
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,530
it's RFC 22 knee equally hard and the

563
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:11,330
CSR adjoining side of things right okay

564
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:14,780
on the other side I'm just thinking okay

565
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:21,110
on the other side of things so then the

566
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:24,139
the the CAA has to then process the CSR

567
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:26,659
where in the asses there are some issues

568
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,460
with getting things in and out but I

569
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,340
would say they're not really a lot worse

570
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,380
or better in my experience but there are

571
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,840
other CA software you are writing

572
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,420
probably has as much harder to change

573
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,330
and much harder to update particularly

574
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,840
if it's out ported I don't know if you

575
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,550
saw

576
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,780
I missed it yesterday morning Kathleen

577
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:51,560
Moriarty no so she hasn't a document on

578
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:54,830
acne integration for the registrar so

579
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:58,850
the situation where the RA or the

580
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,449
registrar is using Acme to get

581
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:03,889
certificate

582
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:07,820
from a CA and what happens RFC 22 name

583
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:12,439
is completely supported and it's a must

584
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:14,210
for that whereas other other name kind

585
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,090
of things are probably far less

586
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,750
supportive so that's probably outside of

587
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:23,029
our space of work you put a CSR for

588
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,919
anything you like just the Acme guy at

589
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,230
the other end isn't going to deal with

590
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,260
the specialized thing for us so I think

591
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,210
your argument is correct that we need to

592
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,750
stick with with well known stuff because

593
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:38,630
that stuff is hard after the human

594
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:41,149
readable nests of it none of it is

595
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,539
particularly human readable all over

596
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:47,689
cars and asn.1 decoder to see so if you

597
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:50,059
think about it that way right yes there

598
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,519
are you eyes that show you RFC 22 names

599
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:54,639
but they're not human readable I can't

600
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,350
read that certificate easily with with

601
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,850
with more command can I can I ask you

602
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,459
before you go on because my

603
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:04,039
understanding was that because asn.1 be

604
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,600
RDR itself identifying so it does know

605
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,340
it's a string so it just prints the

606
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:14,600
string as opposed to a hex prep

607
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:18,080
presentation it still becomes it still

608
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,668
becomes very at that level it's very as

609
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,639
a care if you're at that level of doing

610
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:25,039
things then it's you and me and three

611
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:25,639
other people in the room doing it anyway

612
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,860
okay

613
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:31,519
everyone else needs a piece of software

614
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,019
to see the artist 28:20 2d as well as

615
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,880
they would for any other well I was

616
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:36,440
actually looking at out you know what

617
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,360
you know a pre standard implementation

618
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,919
of the white list which is just the list

619
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,010
of identifies then you have the strings

620
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,620
they also nicely you know whatever ipv6

621
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,059
address at my domain right so I think

622
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,158
there there are a lot of you know

623
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:56,928
operational processes where I think this

624
00:33:49,159 --> 00:34:03,110
really does get read by humans decoded

625
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:07,340
and dump it to my screen I do that I

626
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:09,230
will see I will see the the the I will

627
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,060
see it sure pointing to name on my

628
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,370
screen and I will see other names and

629
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,529
a ski on my screen both of them in the

630
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,920
middle of a blob of garbage right what

631
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,810
is it

632
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,630
equally well you can see them that that

633
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:23,029
way to get anything more complicated

634
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:25,220
than that you need to have software it

635
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,230
knows what's going on and I'm saying

636
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:29,000
this probably as easy to do other neat

637
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,040
printing as it is but I'm just talking

638
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,900
about unchanged software right so I'm

639
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,610
talking about their show certificate in

640
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,110
pretty much all the places where I've

641
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:45,230
dealt with certificates and they

642
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:48,140
basically departs them but because of

643
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,929
the fact that the CAS don't process

644
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:52,489
things that they don't understand right

645
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,109
they won't put things and they don't

646
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:57,680
need at the ends and stuff that they

647
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,990
don't know about then it's hard to get

648
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,910
into change that's the argument not the

649
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,770
human right so but wait a second so

650
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,600
you're saying that if I'm if I'm having

651
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,670
a certificate I'm trying to departs I

652
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,799
see there is a new attribute of string

653
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:18,440
type I would still show it hexadecimal

654
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:21,890
or not showing it at all I mean so

655
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,140
that's what happens if you get not

656
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:28,040
nothing in particular a lot of the

657
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:32,600
programs are our intolerant of UTF and

658
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,759
other stuff and so all those things the

659
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,950
argument isn't it's human readable the

660
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,980
argument is certification authorities

661
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:42,919
are conservative in what they'll process

662
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,410
and it's hard it's very hard to get them

663
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,180
to doing things so if your registrar

664
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,160
does not have a built-in certificate

665
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,089
authority it's gonna be the case for

666
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,490
most people's code then then it's it's a

667
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,890
problem if you are coding a certificate

668
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:00,979
authority it's probably as easy to do

669
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,509
RFC 22 Nemeth or other name anyway they

670
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,670
tend that they both require coding

671
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,820
expression on the CSR attribute side of

672
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:10,430
things okay okay so say you have the

673
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,410
right of solution but the wrong argument

674
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,240
that's why you're having well I think I

675
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,810
think you're basically more with me on

676
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,970
the using RFC 822 name then you know on

677
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,110
on the need of having human readable

678
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,790
string that's fine I'll take that

679
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:29,150
feedback and bring it up with Ben

680
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:31,009
no restrain it would contain the same

681
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,510
string but we can now relax the string

682
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,820
that's my proposal right we can relax

683
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:37,040
the string insofar as that we're not

684
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,930
limited to 64 bytes on the local part

685
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,400
when we start having more options right

686
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,810
but I would keep the string because I

687
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,520
like really the string encoding as

688
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,520
making really easy for human readability

689
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:05,030
that has anything that will be a thing

690
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:07,609
that that people can do probably a lot

691
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:10,820
of them will actually say allow a

692
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:13,730
connection for anything as a certificate

693
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,109
from this CA which case the contents of

694
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,030
the name use so I'll try to summarize

695
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:18,740
what you said also by the thread on the

696
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,599
mailing list and go back to Ben and say

697
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,060
that you know yeah I was making this

698
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,830
proposal but you know we're really in

699
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,150
the group not really feeling safe to

700
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,150
change from where we are right now okay

701
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:38,750
this is fine we what we can take we'll

702
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,390
take this to the list of busy so now the

703
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:46,880
security profiles so they're kind of you

704
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:49,190
know so basically all the security

705
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,310
profiles stuff has been improved and

706
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,020
redone so generic ACP certificate

707
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,660
requirements right must be compliant

708
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,550
with 50 to 80 obviously the minimum

709
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,560
fields required are those required by

710
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,599
the domain membership check anything

711
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,490
beyond that is whatever the operator

712
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:08,089
wants to use the certificate for in

713
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:10,129
addition to the ACP membership check and

714
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:10,520
it would for Diagnostics it would be

715
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,119
lovely

716
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,150
to copy the IDF ID identifiers of a

717
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,720
device but of course it's a privacy risk

718
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:23,150
and then the stuff crypto so the choice

719
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,890
is here now if I've tried to come up

720
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,020
with something so this is basically

721
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,220
exactly for review so obviously for this

722
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,960
whole crypto stuff I'll create another

723
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:37,589
thread summarizing this so must have an

724
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,440
e CDH key should be signed with EC d HK

725
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,570
and otherwise if you can't still you

726
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,600
know all c8 not signed with EC D H must

727
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:48,450
be signed with RSA key and the reason

728
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,549
would be that EC D H is shorter in the

729
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,560
certificate and basically the more we go

730
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:56,040
to longer Keys the more important list

731
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,720
becomes and of course this implies that

732
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,770
the secure general protocols must be

733
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,870
able to do with these type of

734
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,790
certificates so now the question is what

735
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:05,130
crypto parameters on this purely on the

736
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,779
certificate side are missing right so

737
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,000
obviously the minimum signing links

738
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,680
whatever recommendation you know people

739
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,410
shout in the room I'll take as default

740
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,180
and then go with it or I mean asking Ben

741
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,680
and the others so basically there there

742
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,629
some of these documents here where I'm

743
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,850
going to reach out to other people that

744
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,440
hopefully can give me more answer there

745
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,420
is some somewhat of a complaint here

746
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,840
even though I have the no whining

747
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,180
sticker here I haven't really found a

748
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,640
good RFC for you know basic certificate

749
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,230
requirements and I found the good RFC

750
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,440
for ikely two requirements for inter

751
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:38,700
ability but even that says cryptographic

752
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,120
recommendations for certificates are out

753
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,770
of scope of the document pkix community

754
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,080
will do with it so obviously you can't

755
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,000
build into our operating actually two

756
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,730
implementations if you don't have you

757
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,650
know interoperating certificates so i

758
00:39:50,730 --> 00:40:01,380
wondering why they were able to lay them

759
00:39:52,650 --> 00:40:04,850
out on that one without a reference well

760
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,850
this is a 20-17 document right

761
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:12,620
certification authorities do what they

762
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:16,440
do and they do it with minimal kind of

763
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:20,160
respect for what we tell them okay

764
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,860
the the unless your mozilla person or a

765
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,359
Google person and can't read them a

766
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,830
right act as to whether what you're

767
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,490
going to support in your browser next

768
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:36,000
week they are doing what they do which

769
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:43,709
is 2048 bit RSA which is and then 256

770
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,950
bit ECDSA with the set P 256 there's a K

771
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,869
or a 1 I can't remember that that's what

772
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,029
they that's what they do right now

773
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:52,859
in the web browser space how do people

774
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:54,900
produce interoperable IPSec

775
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:58,348
implementations well the majority of

776
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,539
those are single vendor verticals or you

777
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:02,700
buy the XYZ course

778
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,619
remote access solution and then you

779
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,649
actually didn't part of the certificate

780
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,650
authority

781
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,529
so the my culture said we need to go

782
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:14,789
faster so I've basically taken down to

783
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:17,999
4248 for RSA and 256 for ECDSA with P

784
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:26,219
256 as a recommendation I actually

785
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:28,799
suggest that reference the cab for her

786
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:30,660
requirements and suggest that they are

787
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:33,029
the right answer and that's it

788
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:41,009
but that means is that is it a result of

789
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:46,319
reference that somebody can okay so then

790
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:48,450
the IP six stuff so basically now the

791
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,979
two references for the recommendations

792
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:53,609
from end of 2017

793
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:55,739
8:22 one and eight two four seven are in

794
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:58,890
there luckily I found them nobody

795
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:00,479
pointed me to them so in IPSec it

796
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,538
stripped down to just one security

797
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:06,180
profile which was chosen because it's

798
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,890
the best performant one we really don't

799
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,019
need backward compatibility given how

800
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,779
there's a new implementation likely to

801
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:16,229
no stripping down it's just software and

802
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:17,940
we obviously can add more IOT profiles

803
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:20,189
for those links later on because it's

804
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,979
hope I hope we don't need an MPI so on

805
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,779
the crypto side in the signaling IP 2 we

806
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:26,609
must use the full certificates because

807
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:30,779
we need the ACP information so that's

808
00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:32,519
pkcs7 ret x.509 certificate must have

809
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:35,400
all the intermediate serves in the chain

810
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:41,008
and the proposed ipsec profile is AES

811
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:43,289
GCM 16 know now encryption and obviously

812
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:45,869
may support any more crypto profiles

813
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:48,569
that are not of lower security so now

814
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:52,319
the question is what crypto parameters

815
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:53,759
are missing from the specification so

816
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,579
now I'm going to reach out to the folks

817
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:58,619
who wrote these two profiles to tell me

818
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,749
if I was actually missing something but

819
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,550
GCM should make things easier because

820
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:05,009
it's self

821
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,440
integrity checking so no separate

822
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:10,319
security check needed DTLS went through

823
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,339
without anything um so that was a

824
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,220
surprisingly good then we've got as the

825
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:20,160
final one TLS as used end-to-end within

826
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,618
the ACP and the normative reference for

827
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,649
that is of course the use by a grasp

828
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,390
itself but any other protocol across the

829
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:31,290
ACP that's newly built should obviously

830
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:32,940
also use TLS and there's obviously an

831
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,250
interesting issue when we bring in IOT

832
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,069
device that don't want to do TCP then we

833
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,380
need to create more MTI not only TLS but

834
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:42,569
you know server devices would need to

835
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,819
support you know some secure app in

836
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:47,790
addition to TLS so this is the ongoing

837
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:50,160
discuss with Ben what security profiles

838
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,619
to demand a basically recommended three

839
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,779
I was thinking of the middle one but

840
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,920
then he was also saying that the nature

841
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,180
of the RSA EDC s key size elliptic curve

842
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,309
so basically there may be one or two

843
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,109
parameters missing so I hope I can

844
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:07,230
resolve these things very quickly and

845
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:09,980
that was basically it and then was just

846
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,980
an hour all the time

847
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:15,789
okaythis have a much shorter I hope next

848
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:21,279
slide just the quick reminder what's in

849
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:23,769
this document it it really is the I

850
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,640
guess I color is pink it's the pink bit

851
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:29,558
the the API for a functional library for

852
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:35,288
calling and functions the grasp core

853
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:37,180
from an autonomic service agent next the

854
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:38,739
contents of the turfed i'm not going to

855
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,140
go through it because we've had this

856
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,700
discussion before in a different room or

857
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,960
possibly even in the same room i don't

858
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,930
know

859
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,730
it goes through design principles some

860
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,828
comments on asynchronous operations

861
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,470
because grasp is an asynchronous

862
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:55,299
protocol it talks about the parameters

863
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:58,328
and data structures that are proposed

864
00:45:55,299 --> 00:46:00,940
for the API and then it goes through the

865
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:06,549
various functions describing the API for

866
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:10,210
each each function and I remind you that

867
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:12,788
this is an API spec in the IETF api's

868
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,499
tend to be informational documents so

869
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:16,450
it's not held to the same standard as a

870
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:18,459
standard tract document with all the

871
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:21,279
most and shirts because you know we know

872
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,660
that implementations have to deal with

873
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:31,749
the real world of their own operating

874
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:33,999
system this is evolution but this this

875
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:36,519
is definitely not standards track and

876
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:43,419
it's not if cause bound to an individual

877
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:45,220
language I don't think so because I

878
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:49,029
think we need experience we need people

879
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:51,488
to write api's for various operating

880
00:46:49,029 --> 00:46:53,230
systems and languages and you see if we

881
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:55,210
can extract the standard practice from

882
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,819
them and of course the way I designed

883
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,650
this API because I designed it suits my

884
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:01,599
programming style and other people might

885
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,940
want to do it differently so I think we

886
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,059
need to get something out into the field

887
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:10,530
and then be prepared for feedback on it

888
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:11,910
in a year or two so next slide please

889
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,860
that is the only question I have today

890
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,240
that I don't have any issues because I

891
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,780
haven't received any comments for a long

892
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,140
time

893
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,940
is are we ready to you know provoke

894
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:38,700
people to look for issues by doing a

895
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:41,070
working group law school I haven't

896
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,629
received a complete review from anybody

897
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,390
but it's one of the things you do in

898
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,910
working group law school there were

899
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:49,830
there were there were comments at an

900
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:54,270
earlier stage and since then you know

901
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:56,310
we've responded to comments and hadn't

902
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:58,500
received further comments even despite

903
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:00,240
asking the list for comments so you know

904
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,360
either people don't think we should do

905
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:36,990
this job or we should try and provoke

906
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:40,440
some for some reviews okay so you're

907
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:53,250
promising again let the record show that

908
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:55,500
mr. Michael Richardson promised and in

909
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,990
particular look at it as a si programmer

910
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,780
because you know I designed this with

911
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:04,020
the with the viewpoint of a Python

912
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:07,170
programmer and has been used by an a

913
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:09,480
master student in in Germany

914
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,220
successfully so apparently it's not you

915
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,510
know completely bogus but you know it

916
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,509
needs more it needs more checking

917
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:31,559
did you add the US okay action

918
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:45,450
you missed too much time then not real

919
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:47,799
fixed the comments from them okay

920
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,180
that's okay I don't want to have to come

921
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:50,950
back to the next meeting and say the

922
00:49:49,180 --> 00:50:24,910
same thing so that that's the right time

923
00:49:50,950 --> 00:50:28,149
scale yeah yeah this is a report for the

924
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:31,629
rich Chapman progress and give a little

925
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:36,579
bitty explanation on our potential new

926
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:38,349
cutter next page please yeah actually we

927
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:39,579
shoot down the rich and renowned

928
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:42,099
tomorrow

929
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:45,249
it was supposed to be two years at the

930
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:48,489
very beginning but it's normal IETF

931
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:52,839
working group a critic around three

932
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:57,749
years to two years planning work so we

933
00:50:52,839 --> 00:51:02,199
actually did that in four years time but

934
00:50:57,749 --> 00:51:05,140
that's where we get the very frustration

935
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:16,239
with Richard we're in progress we are

936
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:19,170
three years yeah we actually start the

937
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:25,989
proposed charter knew each other around

938
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:29,199
ITF 102 and many iran's discussing with

939
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:31,110
the working group and also other people

940
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:32,490
around

941
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:34,910
[Music]

942
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:42,060
and we actually reach the convergence

943
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:46,649
before the IDF 103rd and we have

944
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:50,130
submitted that to iest review and later

945
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:54,210
last year November in since then we have

946
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:57,839
eight update rushing already and the

947
00:51:54,210 --> 00:52:02,390
latest one was proposed earlier this

948
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:05,520
month and it's supposed has you know

949
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:10,049
calling all the discussing we hear from

950
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:15,780
iest rads actually I believe we clean

951
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:19,080
all the blocks this morning so that's

952
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:23,849
going way off for iest now which I will

953
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:28,520
show you later and we hopefully go for

954
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:33,570
the external review and first go for IB

955
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:38,280
and then later for the IDF meninist for

956
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:42,780
wider comments but at actually means we

957
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:47,700
will not get the our new header in this

958
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:51,000
month maybe sometime next month so even

959
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,819
those drafts we had learned in the new

960
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:00,650
chatter as milestone had to be weighed

961
00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:05,460
and accuracy of them will present this

962
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:07,980
today and I would like to hear the

963
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:13,310
working group opinion on them but not

964
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:17,550
official adopt and that adoption will

965
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:28,650
come back on the menu is after we get

966
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:31,790
our new charter we can do it again today

967
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,790
yes three of them

968
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,729
primarily also water birds of eveness a

969
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:51,410
snow globe is still there but his buddy

970
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:53,180
went missing we I think what he would

971
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,060
like to see immediately is that we put

972
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:58,040
in the milestones for those four ones

973
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,540
and you know while we removed it from

974
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,520
the charge of it cost people to divide

975
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,349
automatic process what we're trying to

976
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,210
do is you know start with ones that we

977
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:07,550
feel could be done within a year or one

978
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:09,290
I get more so I think we're going to

979
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:13,490
reach out with the authors and reconfirm

980
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:16,009
that and then put the milestones in yeah

981
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:21,560
laughter the major point we received

982
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:23,510
during those discussing is the idea

983
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,390
particularly the ISD

984
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:29,060
ATandT want us to you know flood our

985
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:31,549
working group and we should currently

986
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:34,670
whatever the working group adopt it

987
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:42,230
should be delivery us you know a

988
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:47,290
complete object in time so not a next

989
00:54:42,230 --> 00:55:12,500
page actually there is a wiki you know

990
00:54:47,290 --> 00:55:20,509
everybody could check it and yeah in

991
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:26,359
totally different numbering system yeah

992
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:31,430
I plan to do that so this is that what

993
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:36,730
you know whey proteins a for the primary

994
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:40,399
milestone and actually we pick up one

995
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:43,730
from each error we identified for the

996
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:47,540
working group that doesn't mean you know

997
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:53,109
we were only works on those crafts that

998
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:56,000
only means those crafts here's a mature

999
00:55:53,109 --> 00:56:00,470
situation up to now too

1000
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:05,950
first and the church will manage the

1001
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:08,660
rest depends on you know how fast those

1002
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:11,930
drafts coming out of the working group

1003
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:17,690
because as I said we don't want to you

1004
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:20,690
know either block our new work all get

1005
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:24,770
you know too little energy to complete

1006
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:29,650
the current working group work items so

1007
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:34,070
today I believe we will have the ASA

1008
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:38,600
guidance present in the morning and the

1009
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:44,450
grasp of distribution pre present this

1010
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:47,509
morning and the constant water already

1011
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:51,230
being working group document and

1012
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:53,660
constant joint proxy will be present

1013
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:57,680
this afternoon and three of them we

1014
00:56:53,660 --> 00:57:00,080
would like to hear you know how the

1015
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,589
weather the working group supports the

1016
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,690
autopsy but we weren't talking at this

1017
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:08,930
meeting it has to wait for the new

1018
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:15,440
charter basically that's it any

1019
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:53,240
questions suggestions once twice okay

1020
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:56,330
let's move thank you so I'm kind of an

1021
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,029
order from uc3m I I had to us it service

1022
00:57:56,330 --> 00:58:00,980
fee they say to move it up in the agenda

1023
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:04,430
because I have five p-waves to culture

1024
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:07,580
at 11:30 so apologies and thanks for

1025
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:09,270
also for the the other presenters I it

1026
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:12,720
will not take long so

1027
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:16,320
I promise so the idea of this draft is

1028
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,439
to present a use case that we have that

1029
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,410
where we we believe that the stuff that

1030
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,590
animal is doing may be helpful for us so

1031
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:27,600
I'm kind of new to anima so maybe I will

1032
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,970
there may be some assumptions from our

1033
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:33,810
side that are incorrect so please don't

1034
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:36,839
be sad on with me but this is the

1035
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:41,520
already able to to see whether anima can

1036
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:44,220
or specifically rats can can be helpful

1037
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,710
in for the use case that we have so the

1038
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,390
motivation is basically we we are

1039
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:49,950
working in several points on what we

1040
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:52,670
call for computing so basically it's

1041
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:55,830
visualization push the world toward eh

1042
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:58,020
where we have like very volatile

1043
00:58:55,830 --> 00:59:00,240
environments is not like a data center

1044
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:03,060
because we may have resources on mobile

1045
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,910
phones access points base stations cars

1046
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:09,060
this kind of very heterogeneous and

1047
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:11,220
volatile environment and on that we are

1048
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,110
basically working on neutralization

1049
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:15,660
approaches and use cases that may

1050
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:19,080
benefit or use those those resources in

1051
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:21,480
this very kind of dynamic environment so

1052
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:24,930
we we have some stuff in SSC for example

1053
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:27,150
and we are looking into kind of

1054
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:37,410
orchestration approaches that deal with

1055
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:39,720
this very dynamic environment so ok so

1056
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,759
this is the one potential scenario that

1057
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,850
we are talking tackling in in this place

1058
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,640
basically we have like different fog

1059
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:50,880
notes basically resources where we can

1060
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:54,540
put functions in like an NSF see kind of

1061
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,580
way and this function for example we

1062
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:59,400
have a chain of f1 and f2 may be running

1063
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,799
on on this fog node B and I'm

1064
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,020
out a initially for example and then fog

1065
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,730
node a is moving away and we need to

1066
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,980
move the function that is running a fog

1067
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:10,260
not a function one to a different

1068
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,970
resource fog no see so basically this

1069
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,630
with current orchestration mechanisms is

1070
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:16,890
hard to do because it's very much

1071
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:18,600
reactive kind of thing and we believe

1072
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:20,490
that we we need some kind of more

1073
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,279
predictive things in order to be able to

1074
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:24,600
cope with this so basically we have

1075
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,880
we call for resource information

1076
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:31,200
platform so something that allows to get

1077
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,700
more dynamic more up-to-date events from

1078
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,250
the resources and to also be able to

1079
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:53,759
predict stuff and be able to trigger

1080
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:56,060
event so the definition describe where

1081
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:02,570
it should be

1082
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:02,570
you mean the what the the

1083
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:30,120
okay maybe an end user device so for

1084
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:32,040
example the mobile it may be device in

1085
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,600
the in the network it may be a device at

1086
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,990
the edge of the network like an access

1087
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:39,029
point so I mean in the draft there are

1088
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:41,370
more definitions about what we we mean

1089
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:43,830
by a node and maybe also references

1090
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:46,740
to I'm sure the reference to the place

1091
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:49,080
where we are doing these things but it's

1092
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:51,990
a it's a generic concept I agree that

1093
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:54,390
it's like resources going beyond the

1094
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:56,009
classical data center that will be kind

1095
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,529
of this thing like in the in the cloud

1096
01:01:56,010 --> 01:02:00,750
and trying to have resources in in

1097
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,490
devices that are in in the very close

1098
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,700
environment of the of the end user

1099
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,589
device that in this case maybe a TV a

1100
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:12,359
drone or something like that for this

1101
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:20,610
particular example is some end user

1102
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:22,500
those extra resources yes yeah yeah in

1103
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,510
the present we have we are dealing with

1104
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,490
these kind of environments mobile phone

1105
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:29,940
but maybe also car so these kind of

1106
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:32,430
things so it's research for yet but we

1107
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,290
we have like real use cases for cloud

1108
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:37,000
robotics and for drone control and these

1109
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:38,410
kind of things where we we do this

1110
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,170
and as part of this a scenario we

1111
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:43,750
believe that we need this kind of New

1112
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:47,800
York efficient solutions more reactive

1113
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:55,080
more proactive let's say not reactive so

1114
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:57,400
for example basically what we have is a

1115
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:59,348
new monitoring framework based on two

1116
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,780
components four gauges that are running

1117
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:03,849
on some or all of the fog notes

1118
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:07,240
basically responsive of sending

1119
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:08,650
information to the controller entity

1120
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,839
which is the other entity that we

1121
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:12,400
foresee and therefore control entity

1122
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,020
based on information that it gets from

1123
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,359
the different nodes may trigger an

1124
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,740
orchestration event for example my

1125
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,869
written a function to a different note

1126
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:22,080
or a scaling of the resources that are

1127
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:24,700
associated to are allocated to one

1128
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:27,420
function these kind of things so this is

1129
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:31,930
basically kind of the the overall a

1130
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:35,500
scenario oops this one thank you

1131
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:38,140
so we have the different notes where we

1132
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:40,510
may have have been talking about HT NFV

1133
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,250
terminology and in some of them in this

1134
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,960
case in all of them we have this fog

1135
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:46,210
agent and there will be a controller in

1136
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,130
the infrastructure so basically what we

1137
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:51,180
want to use anima for and in my stuff

1138
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:54,040
class in this case is to basically

1139
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,859
bootstrap discover all these folk agents

1140
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,420
make the connection or the association

1141
01:03:56,859 --> 01:04:00,460
between these folk agents and the fog

1142
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:02,680
monitoring controller add infrastructure

1143
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:05,170
so this is basically what we are aiming

1144
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,509
at I will not go into all the details

1145
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:10,210
but we have some dioramas in the in the

1146
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:13,510
draft how this fog nose may both trapped

1147
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:15,369
the fog agents may discover that there

1148
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,960
is a controller they may change

1149
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:18,880
different information on the

1150
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,710
capabilities of these four gauges and

1151
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,880
based on that we may have association

1152
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,359
between the controller and the four

1153
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,010
gates

1154
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,810
these are simple scenario and maybe

1155
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:27,339
multiple controllers and maybe multiple

1156
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:29,980
associations all these kind of things

1157
01:04:27,339 --> 01:04:33,099
are at least introducing the in the

1158
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:36,609
current version of the of the draft so

1159
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:39,369
we try to analyze how we can use glass

1160
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:41,980
for this and we already discuss

1161
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:44,020
mechanisms or dissolution this the flow

1162
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,300
diagram before using them discovery

1163
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:47,920
messages with new objectives and not

1164
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,200
just these options like for example we

1165
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,210
want to this

1166
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,160
cover all the vocations running on a

1167
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:56,170
particular type of folk note with a

1168
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,970
particular type of connectivity or with

1169
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:00,490
a particular type of resources

1170
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:02,230
visualization capabilities these kind of

1171
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:05,529
things and we also define different

1172
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:06,940
multicast scopes for for the use of this

1173
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:10,329
discovery in mechanics discovery

1174
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:12,940
messages so I don't want to consume more

1175
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:15,640
time my goal was to basically introduce

1176
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,079
this use case that I guess it's a bit

1177
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,290
different from what we have been

1178
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:21,579
discussing in anima lately and to see

1179
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:24,490
there are people that may be potentially

1180
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:27,030
interested in this we have a ready code

1181
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:29,140
for staff based on the visualization

1182
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:31,630
working and we want to start doing

1183
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:33,700
things with using rasp for this this is

1184
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:37,720
not yet there but if people are

1185
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:38,980
interested in in this please say that in

1186
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,310
the mailing list or contact me offline

1187
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:45,070
and I will be very much happy to to

1188
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:46,599
collaborate I think this may be in the

1189
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:49,750
scope of the new charter in the future

1190
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:52,000
like a potential use case to to document

1191
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:54,700
but I mean at this point what we really

1192
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,380
want to have is if to see if there is

1193
01:05:54,700 --> 01:06:33,339
anybody in there in the group that wants

1194
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:34,569
to to work on this so well this is

1195
01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:37,599
something that we wanna we wanna

1196
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:39,790
investigate and we wanna try so we have

1197
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:42,609
focused on the discovery part and we

1198
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:44,109
believe that this may be useful but this

1199
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:45,880
is good feedback to to see how to

1200
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:49,060
understand and we will need to implement

1201
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:52,920
the stuff and test and see how it works

1202
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:56,680
but this is part of ongoing exercise

1203
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:59,589
today the thing about UDP for non

1204
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:02,859
discovery and non flooding thoughts

1205
01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:06,650
Trust is the

1206
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:09,020
you know we hit the problem the UDP is

1207
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:11,600
an unreliable protocol there are two

1208
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:14,600
ways to fix that one is to put the

1209
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,319
reliability into grass breeches horrible

1210
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,690
thing to do

1211
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,590
the other is to require that any

1212
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:24,080
operations using it would be basically

1213
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:26,270
doing it important operations so if

1214
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:28,910
something does fails you just repeat it

1215
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:32,119
which is quite a tight constraint on the

1216
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:33,950
application so it's an area where we

1217
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:36,830
actually need some feedback before we do

1218
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:38,439
any workout Tallis Adventure speaking

1219
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:42,380
it's in digital too lame to get up there

1220
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:43,700
the and I'm very interested as an

1221
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,170
individual I'll have to come to a

1222
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,669
conclusion about what I think about the

1223
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:49,340
working look later

1224
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:52,670
I'd love to talk to you kind of just how

1225
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:55,520
it uses the the AI infrastructure and to

1226
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:57,860
get back to the UDP stuff if it is data

1227
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,630
that is being transferred can use grasp

1228
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:01,700
encoding but it doesn't have to use the

1229
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:03,830
you know secured environment right so it

1230
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,240
basically can be just over whatever you

1231
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,730
know forwarding plane exists in the

1232
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:10,549
network with UDP encoding or not because

1233
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:12,740
grasp all supports that and the only you

1234
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:14,720
know secure stuff is what needs to be

1235
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,399
secured net goes to the ATP selecting

1236
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,608
those are kind of the details which I

1237
01:08:16,399 --> 01:09:08,240
think after we better understand the

1238
01:08:19,609 --> 01:09:09,740
purpose of okay what you like to match

1239
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:15,859
here

1240
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:20,540
oh and how's that pitchin network and

1241
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:23,210
walk easy the useful function for for

1242
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:45,410
others who staff like other are taking

1243
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:47,180
on those notes yeah I think we I mean

1244
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,830
there are some additional details in the

1245
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,770
in the draft but we can definitely work

1246
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:53,590
on on that and try to to provide more

1247
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:57,380
more stuff yeah I mean this was just

1248
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:59,450
starting draft to present this but

1249
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:03,520
definitely there are many things that

1250
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:05,900
needs to be to be a leader so if

1251
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,580
basically I think that there are some

1252
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:10,099
people interesting so we can discuss

1253
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:14,680
offline and and then we will try to put

1254
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:14,680
more meat on on the draft okay thanks

1255
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:28,759
just to comment on what tortoise said

1256
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:32,750
maybe we should stop thinking about how

1257
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:36,530
little can we secure and thinking what

1258
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:39,520
do we absolutely not want to secure and

1259
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,519
everything else is

1260
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:05,120
good morning a man is below it's a quick

1261
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:09,440
update of the information distribution

1262
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:15,730
in Ottoman Network which is mostly based

1263
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,730
on some extension to grasp next please

1264
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:34,549
the previous one thank you yeah this is

1265
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:39,559
a brief reminder of what is the crafter

1266
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:42,860
doing we propose several functions which

1267
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:46,790
could be considered as infrastructure

1268
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:51,739
Isis is actually a skill within the

1269
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:54,230
United Nations are selectively riding

1270
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:59,589
which is a optimization to the current

1271
01:11:54,230 --> 01:12:05,389
flood of grasp and the other tool is a

1272
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:08,980
more sophistication to the even Q

1273
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:15,080
messaging and distributed data storage

1274
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:17,239
and we know in order to support the new

1275
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:23,300
functions we need the cross to be

1276
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:26,690
extended so we propose some update to

1277
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:30,680
add some new message and the answer this

1278
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:40,580
is a synchronization and SubPop new

1279
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:43,700
message next please so the

1280
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:49,880
update seems last idea and we add a new

1281
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:55,010
subsection to discuss how to utilize the

1282
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:58,010
current across API to allow the new

1283
01:12:55,010 --> 01:13:03,020
defined functionalities to call the

1284
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:07,220
grass service and fortunately we found

1285
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:13,280
there was no necessary to extend the

1286
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:16,150
current API so a pet document could go

1287
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,150
as planned

1288
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:26,830
next please yes there's some summary of

1289
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:31,070
the API utilized the further

1290
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:35,809
distribution models and the first one is

1291
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:39,410
a requirement of storing some data from

1292
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:42,890
or not it just simply reuse a discovery

1293
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:46,610
message but with some extension of the

1294
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:51,050
options to find whether there's or some

1295
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:56,480
other node want to share some storage

1296
01:13:51,050 --> 01:14:03,050
space for the specific purpose and then

1297
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:04,549
is if some nas replies the data will be

1298
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:08,930
transferred transmitted by the

1299
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:13,070
synchronized calling of the kraspo and

1300
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:16,580
if there's some publication information

1301
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:21,820
to all the nodes the flood messages

1302
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:30,090
sorry the flood it guy is reused

1303
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:33,780
next please and the sub if

1304
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:37,320
mission is to for the submission of

1305
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:42,330
service a fake type of information we

1306
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:48,110
reuse the original objective API already

1307
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:54,780
defined and also the flawed message and

1308
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:58,440
then if there's some new event against

1309
01:14:54,780 --> 01:15:01,219
the submission then synchronized will be

1310
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:06,929
again reused

1311
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:14,250
next please yeah that's basically the

1312
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:17,820
update so for the cross distribution the

1313
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:22,980
most sophisticated is actually hiding

1314
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:26,480
within the modules rather than very

1315
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:32,990
sophisticated expansion to current

1316
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:38,179
either API or course messages so in

1317
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:43,910
standardization perspective it is fairly

1318
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:50,460
fairly easy nothing very difficult to do

1319
01:15:43,910 --> 01:16:16,290
okay any question okay then let's save

1320
01:15:50,460 --> 01:16:18,330
some room so but is there anybody else -

1321
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:21,710
no - the building - to reveal this work

1322
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:24,900
because I think this we're a couple of

1323
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:31,610
IPS would be interesting to see we can

1324
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:31,610
get more feedback thank you very much

1325
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:42,570
and yeah let's stick it with that thank

1326
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:42,570
you next on the list

1327
01:16:43,170 --> 01:17:26,350
yeah I'll say it this one you are so

1328
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:31,030
lucky to imagine from over the new chart

1329
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:34,000
has been approved because these are not

1330
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:35,320
new documents but we haven't really put

1331
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,720
the question about working group

1332
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:40,120
adoption because we were waiting for the

1333
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:43,600
Charter so assume the Charter gets

1334
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:44,140
approved in the coming hours and next

1335
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,630
slide please

1336
01:17:44,140 --> 01:18:19,570
oh no no wait a minute wait a minute

1337
01:17:48,630 --> 01:18:21,250
there's news anyway this is just a

1338
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,240
reminder of what's in the drafts I don't

1339
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:25,290
think there's much point in having

1340
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:28,990
substantive discussion and until we can

1341
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:33,760
officially put them into the Charter put

1342
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:35,500
them into the milestones this one still

1343
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,520
needs work nobody is saying that it's

1344
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:40,570
ready for publication or anything but I

1345
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,090
believe the under the new charter this

1346
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:45,460
would be very very suitable candidate

1347
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:49,230
for adoption so it still has the same

1348
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:52,150
contents as it did last time

1349
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:54,490
describes the logical structure of an

1350
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:57,790
autonomic service agent how it interacts

1351
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:59,349
with the autonomic infrastructure some

1352
01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:02,560
comments on the design of gross

1353
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:04,480
projective x' because see the

1354
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:09,490
information about that in the grasp spec

1355
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:12,280
is intentionally quite limited then a

1356
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:14,889
discussion on the lifecycle is used

1357
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,809
since autonomic Service agents are

1358
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:21,340
pieces of code that are very likely to

1359
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:25,060
be installed dynamically and an updated

1360
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:27,310
dynamically on a working system the

1361
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:29,170
problem that Laura raised a long time

1362
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,900
ago which may of course in the end news

1363
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:35,260
its own draft I

1364
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:40,089
of coordination when you have autonomic

1365
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:43,090
service agents that are both interfering

1366
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:45,190
with the same bits of configuration if

1367
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:48,520
you like so you have to make sure that

1368
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:54,040
they don't fight each other now those

1369
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:55,840
are the main topics and you know the

1370
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,320
question I got asked hypothetically

1371
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,060
since we can't ask it until the new

1372
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,309
charter is in place is whether the

1373
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:05,800
working group is ready to adopt this

1374
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:08,620
work which doesn't imply of course that

1375
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:11,230
you agree with what it says that implies

1376
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,580
that you think the subject matter is

1377
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:20,830
something the working group should work

1378
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:24,790
on so at this point the question is how

1379
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:30,670
many people have actually read it I see

1380
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:33,040
a few hands yeah yeah we made a few more

1381
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:48,280
people to read it before we actually had

1382
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:53,140
the adoption discussion because earlier

1383
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:58,420
we appreciate we has another snippet for

1384
01:20:53,140 --> 01:21:02,500
the lifecycle management is that still

1385
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:05,469
another part oh because what we have

1386
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:08,260
even less crafty that's the various

1387
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:11,020
section for the lifecycle but that

1388
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:15,219
that's just the three short compared to

1389
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:17,650
a separate draft so we are still going

1390
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:24,010
to have that one for the map cycle

1391
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:25,989
management in fact the the point in the

1392
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:28,870
draft or the lifecycle and coordination

1393
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:31,509
was just to highlight important aspect

1394
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:33,010
considering the guidelines I hope to go

1395
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:34,690
into all the details that will be

1396
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:37,750
covered by the potential draft on

1397
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:39,280
lifecycle and yes we believe it's

1398
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:42,530
important that this is in this draft

1399
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:45,679
heat at morehouse pointers

1400
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:47,809
laughs okay so you're still has declare

1401
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:51,320
for the map Second Amendment left

1402
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:54,410
because that's the another one we had in

1403
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:59,059
the primary master for the second

1404
01:21:54,410 --> 01:22:00,889
charter for the second child yes so we

1405
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:03,680
would like to see you working on that

1406
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:10,490
draft and read a draft bike next time

1407
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:12,590
why so again if if if the life cycle and

1408
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:14,510
coordination material is covered in

1409
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:19,240
other drafts we would have to adapt the

1410
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:23,000
text in this draft you know due to not

1411
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:25,790
you know to not cause difficulties with

1412
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,350
the dedicated drafts but at the moment

1413
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:30,340
we can't do that of course because there

1414
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:32,360
aren't any such drafts so anyway I

1415
01:22:30,340 --> 01:23:05,740
basically I would encourage people to

1416
01:22:32,360 --> 01:23:05,740
read this because it helps okay which

1417
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:20,000
you would like to avoid same situation

1418
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:25,880
even the life cycle and coordination we

1419
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:33,410
have to discuss suggest that that is

1420
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:35,540
binding to just I like those aspects can

1421
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:44,620
be self-contained and then when the

1422
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:44,620
draft become taking those

1423
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,330
okay so next slide so this is another

1424
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:00,639
draft that's been around for a while

1425
01:23:57,330 --> 01:24:04,480
it's actually I believe a reference for

1426
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:07,230
the distribution draft that being that

1427
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:11,110
talked about

1428
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:14,410
so this discusses use cases for boat

1429
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:15,969
transfer in an autonomic Network some of

1430
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:18,760
the use cases there are probably others

1431
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:22,240
it discusses a general method for doing

1432
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,490
bulk transfer inefficiently I have to

1433
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:27,219
say intentionally it's inefficient if

1434
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:30,910
you like using grasp this cross was not

1435
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:33,550
designed as a bulk transfer protocol and

1436
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:36,940
it gives a worked out example of how to

1437
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:39,070
do it for an elementary file transfer

1438
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:43,629
and it doesn't make the point that if

1439
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:46,780
there is an existing boat transfer

1440
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:49,540
mechanism you know that is more

1441
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:53,200
appropriate for an application we could

1442
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:55,810
perfectly well use that within the ACP

1443
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:59,110
and get the security benefits of the ACP

1444
01:24:55,810 --> 01:25:02,100
without having to artificially use cross

1445
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:21,940
for something that it's not good at

1446
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:37,600
Richard Richardson sorry yeah we don't

1447
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:40,809
talk about intent and specifically the

1448
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,570
question is why we need to do it and are

1449
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:47,080
happy to do it in a somewhat you know

1450
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:49,030
inefficient way rather than using you

1451
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:52,690
know a well-known file transfer protocol

1452
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:57,219
or file sharing protocol you know I I

1453
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:58,960
agree I mean I don't see any urgency in

1454
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:02,030
this although I do actually use it when

1455
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,850
I want to transfer files on my desk

1456
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:08,000
Queen my Linux box in my windows box I

1457
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:11,450
do actually use this now running code

1458
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,880
and I use it quicker than you're putting

1459
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:15,740
files somewhere else and bringing them

1460
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:19,100
back or whatever the other alternatives

1461
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:21,290
might be so it works but I agree I don't

1462
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:23,720
think it's urgent and if you say if

1463
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:26,269
you're asking answering my question by

1464
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:31,090
saying not yet to the adoption question

1465
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:31,090
I I don't care about that that's fine

1466
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:01,730
yeah exactly

1467
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:05,480
but you know I could imagine a context

1468
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:06,980
where you might have very where you're

1469
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:09,980
trying to minimize the amount of

1470
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:12,559
software you after load in your in your

1471
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:15,400
target system and this might be a

1472
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:19,940
cheaper way you know of achieving low

1473
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:23,030
low urgency well transfer than cheaper

1474
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:25,490
in terms of footprint right so III

1475
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:27,259
wouldn't say we should exclude it as a

1476
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:49,880
use case but I agree it's certainly not

1477
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:50,710
important to to push it to first I don't

1478
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,360
think

1479
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:54,070
I don't think there was a must use case

1480
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,650
I just think it's a pragmatic question

1481
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:59,799
if it turned out to be better than you

1482
01:27:56,650 --> 01:28:44,230
know sticking in FF TP code in your in

1483
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:44,840
your your tiny device yeah okay so this

1484
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:47,769
is

1485
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:50,119
completely different definitely

1486
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:55,040
definitely probably not possible under

1487
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:56,630
the old Charter and it was intended to

1488
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,909
present it last time and you ran out of

1489
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:01,880
time so and I wasn't here anyway it was

1490
01:28:58,909 --> 01:29:04,150
finger was going to present it so next

1491
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:07,849
slide please

1492
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:10,909
so this draft talks about scenarios

1493
01:29:07,849 --> 01:29:17,690
where you might want to build your ACP

1494
01:29:10,909 --> 01:29:21,440
as a layer to construct and then tries

1495
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:24,348
to get to some political ideas about

1496
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:26,678
requirements for doing that so next

1497
01:29:24,349 --> 01:29:26,679
slide please

1498
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:32,090
so video of course is that grass doesn't

1499
01:29:29,929 --> 01:29:36,070
have it's in intrinsic security so it

1500
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:39,139
must run over a secured ACP substrate

1501
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:43,219
which should be isolated from the normal

1502
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:45,739
user data plane traffic and we had a

1503
01:29:43,219 --> 01:29:48,080
very very very long argument with Erica

1504
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:51,949
schooler before we got grasped through

1505
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:55,400
the isg and that basically was a very

1506
01:29:51,949 --> 01:29:59,869
strong must in the in the document that

1507
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:03,860
resulted now the regular ACP constructed

1508
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:07,820
at layer 3 is complex and I don't think

1509
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:12,769
that even even tell us what disagree

1510
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:14,449
with that statement and it's aimed at

1511
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:17,330
large networks since clearly we're not

1512
01:30:14,449 --> 01:30:21,949
going to do things like running running

1513
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:24,769
ripple over and building a complete vrf

1514
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:28,190
environment and so on except in a

1515
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:30,349
reasonably complex large network so we

1516
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:32,900
think there are scenarios where a layer

1517
01:30:30,349 --> 01:30:35,630
2 solution could be used you know for

1518
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:37,219
example a small enterprise which is all

1519
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,830
in one building or spread across a

1520
01:30:37,219 --> 01:30:41,389
couple of buildings but it's large

1521
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:44,599
enough that they want an autonomic

1522
01:30:41,389 --> 01:30:46,730
network probably cuz they don't want to

1523
01:30:44,599 --> 01:30:48,140
pay the crew of geeks

1524
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:52,360
to run their network they'd rather the

1525
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:55,820
network ran itself or an enterprise

1526
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:57,799
which prefers to segment its network

1527
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:59,420
into small units for management and

1528
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:03,320
there are a lot of enterprise networks

1529
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:05,090
that do that you know because it's the

1530
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,920
simplest way to think about security is

1531
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:10,430
to have lots of little pieces and keep

1532
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:13,100
each one secure if you decided to do

1533
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:15,650
that you might prefer to build your ACP

1534
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:22,370
locally on each of those pieces of the

1535
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:24,200
network so next please so let's assume

1536
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:29,120
you've made that decision that you want

1537
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:30,980
to build your ACP layer to then the

1538
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,940
draft goes through of course with some

1539
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:38,660
arguments about each of these these

1540
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:45,019
requirements some of them are fairly

1541
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:49,730
obvious it needs to support transmission

1542
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:54,400
of ipv6 packets it doesn't actually on a

1543
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:59,959
single l2 segment need to be running any

1544
01:31:54,400 --> 01:32:02,509
ipv6 routing on a single where to

1545
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:07,550
segment grasp run perfectly happily with

1546
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:09,500
only link local addresses available so

1547
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:14,020
you could imagine a scenario where you

1548
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:14,020
had self-contained autonomic network

1549
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:21,580
running entirely on link local addresses

1550
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:24,050
and of course there'd be some sort of

1551
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:25,910
interface to the network management

1552
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:30,380
center which would be across her

1553
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:32,269
routable part of the network it must

1554
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,250
support l2 multicast that's a

1555
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:35,900
fundamental requirement which we built

1556
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,220
into the design of a grasp which may

1557
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:43,969
have been a mistake but that's what it

1558
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:46,460
is minimum MTU of 1,500 this sort of

1559
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:51,199
fairly obvious there's one little

1560
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:59,019
awkward thing there that we defined the

1561
01:32:51,199 --> 01:33:05,150
the maximum grasp message size as 2048

1562
01:32:59,019 --> 01:33:06,829
which doesn't fit into 1500 that it's

1563
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:08,629
possible we'd also have to add a

1564
01:33:06,829 --> 01:33:12,920
constraint on the deployment of growth

1565
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:16,219
but it also could fit inside 1500 byte

1566
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:18,139
packets which for a lot of things we

1567
01:33:16,219 --> 01:33:24,829
expect people would use grasp for it

1568
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:26,989
isn't a problem you need a technology to

1569
01:33:24,829 --> 01:33:29,960
isolate a set of nodes which were which

1570
01:33:26,989 --> 01:33:31,669
is the ACP VLAN basically so this is

1571
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:35,469
fairly obvious way to do this will be

1572
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:39,320
Leyland technology secure villain and

1573
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:45,860
you need to make sure that access to the

1574
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:50,900
ACP VLAN is authorized in the secure way

1575
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:52,009
so people can't just plug into it as far

1576
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:55,219
as I understand

1577
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:56,749
VLANs that's almost a proprietary

1578
01:33:55,219 --> 01:34:00,440
requirement because there doesn't seem

1579
01:33:56,749 --> 01:34:02,150
to be a very general solution to that

1580
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:04,509
problem but maybe somebody can correct

1581
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:04,509
me

1582
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:43,400
hmm it actually isn't a very difficult

1583
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:45,710
requirement because it's not a

1584
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:49,580
requirements on the network except for

1585
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:51,290
the support of multicast which doesn't

1586
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:55,489
need to because it's level 2 multicast

1587
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:58,400
right I mean you're not saying there are

1588
01:34:55,489 --> 01:35:01,009
any IP you don't tell people they have

1589
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:03,559
to buy an ipv6 router for this they just

1590
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:06,650
have to have a piece of wire or virtual

1591
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:09,650
wire which is capable of carrying ipv6

1592
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:38,719
packets that's not a that's not actually

1593
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:40,940
a requirement it's not to meet yeah this

1594
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,130
is a requirement on the nodes that's

1595
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:44,330
that's correct it's not a what I'm

1596
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,739
saying it's not a requirement on the

1597
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:49,239
network it's a requirement on the nodes

1598
01:35:45,739 --> 01:35:49,239
that they can transmit yeah

1599
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:54,980
[Music]

1600
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:29,730
hope sorry I can't remember yeah okay

1601
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:31,620
let me let me if you can hold on I think

1602
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:33,209
we're nearly there then it turns out

1603
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:40,440
when you continue with the requirements

1604
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:43,500
there's some sherds you'd need the data

1605
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:46,530
plane VLAN and the ACP VLAN to be on the

1606
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:48,930
same physical socket which sounds like a

1607
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:50,550
silly thing to require but I think there

1608
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:54,870
are some implementations where you can

1609
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:59,280
only put one VLAN on a given piece of

1610
01:36:54,870 --> 01:37:01,349
wire no no no no no physical physical

1611
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:03,960
physical physical physical connectors

1612
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:05,520
you know when my readings about VLAN

1613
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:08,100
technology's there seem to be cases

1614
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:12,240
where you can only allocate a given

1615
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:15,350
socket to a single VLAN whereas it

1616
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:17,400
should be able to support more than one

1617
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:19,380
you would like to have line speed

1618
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:21,320
encryption of the VLAN but that's really

1619
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:25,620
a local security decision whether you

1620
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:29,750
pay for one speed encryption and you

1621
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:32,000
need Wadhwa is bridging if if relevant

1622
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,540
[Music]

1623
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,040
show me the neck

1624
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:47,670
I think it's the last one no it's not

1625
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:53,510
the one thing I couldn't figure out how

1626
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:57,600
he could do is to avoid some degree of

1627
01:37:53,510 --> 01:38:01,550
configuration of the loads in order to

1628
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:05,070
reconfigure the VLAN ID and possibly the

1629
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:10,770
password or encryption key for access to

1630
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:14,090
the VLAN you know this isn't a solution

1631
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:18,990
that would self configure itself 100%

1632
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:21,300
where you just ship unpack the boxes and

1633
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:23,550
connect them and magic would happen you

1634
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:26,990
would definitely have to do some some

1635
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:36,540
degree of configuration to to put the

1636
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:38,730
put the VLAN in place and so I'd like to

1637
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:48,540
go back to Shang's point those if you go

1638
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:50,639
back to slides yeah we we said

1639
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:52,950
fairly early stage of the development of

1640
01:38:50,640 --> 01:39:00,950
grasps that we were only going to define

1641
01:38:52,950 --> 01:39:04,380
it for ipv6 the big difference between

1642
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:06,990
ipv6 and ipv4 is going to be the fact

1643
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:09,120
that the concept of a link-local address

1644
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:17,309
although it does exist it was

1645
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:19,470
retrofitted to ipv4 um it's not as well

1646
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:23,220
defined and nicely defined as it is for

1647
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:28,830
ipv6 so I haven't actually thought about

1648
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:34,140
this very deeply um I think you would

1649
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:37,350
run into one problem if you were trying

1650
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:44,490
to operate the grasp relaying mechanisms

1651
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:48,030
where discoveries and floods replicated

1652
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:49,530
on a different interface when they come

1653
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:52,559
in on one interface and they have to go

1654
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:58,380
out on another interface if you don't

1655
01:39:52,560 --> 01:40:01,680
have that in your topology right now if

1656
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:04,290
you do have a single loop apology then I

1657
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,910
think the ipv4 link-local stuff would

1658
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:09,870
work perfectly well and you could be

1659
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:35,660
completely independent of the regular

1660
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:40,410
data plain ipv4 addressing mechanism I

1661
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:44,420
think yes yep yep

1662
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:47,370
and in that case you could you could I

1663
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:51,590
think you could you could translate the

1664
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:51,590
concepts back to ipv4

1665
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:05,550
testing question is just what you use

1666
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:09,240
for the lair through discovery of

1667
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:14,520
neighbors yep which obviously cannot be

1668
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:16,200
tagged and then you probably also don't

1669
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:18,720
want to do something that uses existing

1670
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:20,940
discovery protocols by develop your city

1671
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:23,100
because they may be blocked so you

1672
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:24,690
basically need a layer to allocation do

1673
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:27,900
your discovery which could be later to

1674
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:30,599
grasp negotiate a v10 and wonderful um

1675
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:34,349
so yeah you know it's not that difficult

1676
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:36,800
and these details here are fine as far

1677
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:44,250
as you know having the points of

1678
01:41:36,800 --> 01:42:00,570
consideration of course zero zero draft

1679
01:41:44,250 --> 01:42:12,330
if I'm not mistaken so you know we

1680
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:16,380
should make it I like to say I would

1681
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:20,809
like to say it's a pure layer to you

1682
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:24,750
know solution as I write you but as a

1683
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:30,030
animal working group here as far as I

1684
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:33,600
remember we have the ipv6 in our family

1685
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:36,509
shattered I mean first the state charter

1686
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:57,690
say we should do something I can be

1687
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:59,730
based on ipv6 still no I mean that's you

1688
01:42:57,690 --> 01:43:12,889
know my opinion about charters as if

1689
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:15,478
they if they're wrong changed them AC

1690
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:20,190
retarded ECB on max

1691
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:23,130
so it is an i Tripoli protocol when I

1692
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:25,669
first looked through it they did not

1693
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:28,219
seem to have a key management protocol

1694
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:30,809
that is not true anymore

1695
01:43:28,219 --> 01:43:33,329
but the proposal initially that I had

1696
01:43:30,809 --> 01:43:35,789
was that we would write as we're running

1697
01:43:33,329 --> 01:43:39,630
and the ECP were running like overly

1698
01:43:35,789 --> 01:43:42,989
local v6 addresses okay that we would

1699
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:45,269
propose instead of ESP we would propose

1700
01:43:42,989 --> 01:43:46,348
max act as another option and that we

1701
01:43:45,269 --> 01:43:49,670
would key it that way

1702
01:43:46,349 --> 01:43:52,349
and that it would be effectively

1703
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:55,170
transparent some links might mean access

1704
01:43:52,349 --> 01:44:04,920
and some not as far as I remember hope

1705
01:43:55,170 --> 01:44:09,929
knapsack it is point-to-point okay per

1706
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:12,030
link not for VLAN so that so so you

1707
01:44:09,929 --> 01:44:14,459
actually have to put all of your traffic

1708
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:20,039
including your data plan traffic on that

1709
01:44:14,459 --> 01:44:21,389
link through that channel but they can

1710
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:22,559
be encrypted differently but the point

1711
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:31,860
is that everything that goes at that

1712
01:44:22,559 --> 01:44:33,840
port has to be encrypted so the point is

1713
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:35,940
that that we could get is what I'm

1714
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:38,280
hearing then from you tell me is that we

1715
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:40,919
could have by whether we used the the I

1716
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:43,139
Triple E key management algorithm or IP

1717
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:46,199
to the point is that we would wind up

1718
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:48,900
negotiating a point-to-point set of

1719
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:52,348
tunnels one of which VLANs could be the

1720
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:54,690
ACP the other ones would be for the

1721
01:44:52,349 --> 01:44:57,300
system but that what we would need is

1722
01:44:54,690 --> 01:45:00,178
the additional tag is the VLAN tag okay

1723
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:02,070
and I understand it that it's all

1724
01:45:00,179 --> 01:45:03,900
designed inline cards to run at their

1725
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:07,440
line speed and that they're all very

1726
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:09,179
happy about that but from from from

1727
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:11,669
month my point of view I don't think we

1728
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:15,840
need any more discovery I think that we

1729
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:17,519
can do it all the only question is to

1730
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,530
what extent I don't know very much about

1731
01:45:17,519 --> 01:45:21,769
the I Tripoli's key management protocol

1732
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:25,438
I do know it does take certificates and

1733
01:45:21,769 --> 01:45:27,849
we have certificates okay so the only

1734
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,130
real question is you know

1735
01:45:27,849 --> 01:45:33,550
we might want to put something for

1736
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:36,130
instance define a IP to attribute that

1737
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:39,790
says oh by the way I could have done max

1738
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:42,010
AK at which point you may go well

1739
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:44,199
actually let's start again with max sets

1740
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:46,480
key management system and we'll end into

1741
01:45:44,199 --> 01:45:48,699
the IP - okay that may be the right

1742
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:50,799
answer but given that you have to follow

1743
01:45:48,699 --> 01:45:52,299
the traffic that may not be something

1744
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:55,060
that everyone wants to do in every

1745
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:57,719
situation so maybe maybe there are

1746
01:45:55,060 --> 01:46:01,389
advantages to to not doing it that way

1747
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:04,210
but I think in particular you should say

1748
01:46:01,389 --> 01:46:07,960
is that you have this bridge layer - you

1749
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:10,719
know Canario the bridge mechanisms are

1750
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:13,030
not participating in the ECP they are

1751
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:18,869
invisible things they may even get

1752
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:18,869
provided by another party untrustworthy

1753
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:46,329
in this working group bridges building

1754
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:48,519
just a normal ICP across it and whether

1755
01:46:46,329 --> 01:46:51,400
you do that or not obviously the ability

1756
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:54,010
of existing ACP mechanisms to negotiate

1757
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:56,409
between neighbors something like Mexico

1758
01:46:54,010 --> 01:47:02,800
was something that I mentioned in my

1759
01:46:56,409 --> 01:47:04,869
slides initially it only comes to

1760
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,969
supporting Laird who bridge networks

1761
01:47:04,869 --> 01:47:08,980
with existing ACP I think we're in good

1762
01:47:06,969 --> 01:47:10,929
shape and and big fan of Mexico so

1763
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:13,629
definitely trying to define them

1764
01:47:10,929 --> 01:47:15,579
ACP security as general Association

1765
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:17,800
using Mexico to me would be just a

1766
01:47:15,579 --> 01:47:19,630
matter of finding the cycles to do that

1767
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,659
and you find to find help for that right

1768
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:24,670
so as Michael said the key difference I

1769
01:47:22,659 --> 01:47:26,290
think here would be to relying on a

1770
01:47:24,670 --> 01:47:29,139
pre-established layer - a bridging

1771
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:30,790
domain which by itself is insecure and

1772
01:47:29,139 --> 01:47:33,340
can break right because on the existing

1773
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:36,070
solution of the ACP the big benefit is

1774
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:38,110
you don't rely on the existing bridging

1775
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:39,920
stuff to work the ACP will work even if

1776
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:43,400
you're bridging breaks and this

1777
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:45,140
your solution if the bridging breaks

1778
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,610
da's Charles of race

1779
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:48,080
Sherman so I think those are kind of the

1780
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:50,210
differences I think could be put in

1781
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:52,850
there and then yes I think one of the

1782
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:55,310
things that we might want to look into

1783
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:57,440
is that this whole thing you know also

1784
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:59,090
negotiating a layer to VLAN and then

1785
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:02,210
trying to figure out how to secure that

1786
01:47:59,090 --> 01:48:04,190
layer to layer two so maybe you know

1787
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:06,050
catch up with somebody like norm fin

1788
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:15,769
there are a few later to experts here in

1789
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:19,160
brainstorm this speaking as a working

1790
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:22,880
group member here is context so you have

1791
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:25,519
some things in your document which don't

1792
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:29,030
necessarily align with the operational

1793
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:32,120
reality more practices

01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:38,949
one of the practices is to move it away

1796
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:41,540
from identifiers one and shut down

1797
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:44,928
that's that's just a commonly accepted

1798
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:47,030
practice now the other thing is reading

1799
01:48:44,929 --> 01:48:49,429
the document this time make an

1800
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:50,630
assumption that impression that there is

1801
01:48:49,429 --> 01:48:52,130
an assumption that it looks like

1802
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:54,770
Ethernet cable that means it's

1803
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:57,070
transparent bi-directional and what you

1804
01:48:54,770 --> 01:49:00,230
put on one end you receive on a aware

1805
01:48:57,070 --> 01:49:02,480
that's not necessary true and even if I

1806
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:05,030
talking for the deployments which are

1807
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:07,129
positioning into enterprise site a

1808
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:08,900
common trend and that is increasing to

1809
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:11,690
that both loops Ethernet as a service is

1810
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:14,929
implemented on top of some other packet

1811
01:49:11,690 --> 01:49:16,699
substrates so if you if you see that

1812
01:49:14,929 --> 01:49:19,250
it's a layer two Ethernet connection

1813
01:49:16,699 --> 01:49:21,230
from point A to point B it very well

1814
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:24,860
might be that it is implemented of some

1815
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:26,959
other packet infrastructure and you have

1816
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:30,139
severe restrictions of what tag values

1817
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,580
you can use it does it cannot assume it

1818
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:33,800
cannot be assumed that it will be

1819
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:35,719
bi-directional it cannot be assumed that

1820
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:39,910
you will be able to send multi-point

1821
01:49:35,719 --> 01:49:39,910
multi destination frames in the same way

1822
01:49:40,420 --> 01:51:24,199
so it's years ago it's actually very

1823
01:50:07,580 --> 01:51:27,910
hard to avoid as far as I could tell

1824
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:32,120
there's a lot of variation in the way a

1825
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:45,530
way that proprietary letter stuff does

1826
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:47,599
this if we want to make a recommendation

1827
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:52,489
that would be obvious want to make I I

1828
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:54,440
agree I stage we're at in this document

1829
01:51:52,489 --> 01:51:56,178
it seemed too soon to say that by the

1830
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:59,629
way there is another at least one more

1831
01:51:56,179 --> 01:52:03,130
slide somewhere we're nearly finished

1832
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:20,840
that's the one yeah hold on

1833
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:23,750
being my co-author ipv6 is a must you

1834
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:27,880
maybe it might be more precise to say

1835
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:31,790
what we really need is something that

1836
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:34,909
can prevent autonomous l2 connectivity

1837
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:38,980
and transmission of packets that could

1838
01:52:34,909 --> 01:52:42,379
be secured and separated from no more

1839
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:46,280
dinner plate yeah yeah that that might

1840
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:50,800
be in more preset and for a period for

1841
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:50,800
maybe it's difficult without

1842
01:52:51,909 --> 01:52:59,089
pre-install of some private ipv4

1843
01:52:54,770 --> 01:53:05,060
addresses but with pure o2 solution

1844
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:07,219
Michael just mission mexic we don't have

1845
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:14,179
a clear answer yet but I think maybe

1846
01:53:07,219 --> 01:53:16,280
there are some we are basics this this

1847
01:53:14,179 --> 01:53:19,880
final slide it's probably hardly worth

1848
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:21,500
discussing but one thing we need to do

1849
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:24,139
in the engineering of this is to make

1850
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:26,840
sure that the upper layer which is

1851
01:53:24,139 --> 01:53:29,659
grasped and the lower layer which is the

1852
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:33,530
ACP talk to each other in a reasonably

1853
01:53:29,659 --> 01:53:37,638
standardized way so that you know we we

1854
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:39,769
have ACP code that will work over under

1855
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:42,980
grasp and we have crossed grow their

1856
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:44,929
work over ACP regardless of what choices

1857
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:51,230
are made in the on the two sides of that

1858
01:53:44,929 --> 01:53:54,710
boundary so this suggests to me that you

1859
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:57,320
believe that the entire ACP will be over

1860
01:53:54,710 --> 01:54:01,070
a layer two and that you will not need a

1861
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:04,429
routing protocol that was the thesis

1862
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:07,030
that this would be done in smallish

1863
01:54:04,429 --> 01:54:07,030
segments

1864
01:54:15,469 --> 01:54:21,469
cuz you're gonna have a bunch of

1865
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:23,290
point-to-point links whoa right as said

1866
01:54:21,469 --> 01:54:26,630
you may not be able to say you know

1867
01:54:23,290 --> 01:54:28,699
multicast it things so multicast

1868
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:30,530
multicast is the problem there there may

1869
01:54:28,699 --> 01:54:32,480
be two separate things and I don't think

1870
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:34,519
the issue of what are the addresses is

1871
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:38,209
the issue that you have the issue is

1872
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:40,790
what is your apology and and we actually

1873
01:54:38,210 --> 01:54:42,770
know what the that we know what address

1874
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:45,769
is we've allocated to the what you LA's

1875
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:48,770
we've allocated within the the thing

1876
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:51,199
because they're in the certificates so

1877
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:56,900
it's not really the issue the issue is

1878
01:54:51,199 --> 01:55:39,739
how do you find that's not by the way

1879
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:41,089
that's just using the same ipv6 loopback

1880
01:55:39,739 --> 01:55:42,679
addresses that are used in the data

1881
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:45,100
plane so that basically creates a

1882
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:48,350
dependence against the data plane that's

1883
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:50,390
one of the things I wouldn't like in

1884
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:55,940
general because it makes it very hard to

1885
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:58,130
isolate discovery of a VLAN for an ACP I

1886
01:55:55,940 --> 01:56:00,500
think is very generic from that I'd like

1887
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:02,719
to have then the next thing is you know

1888
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:04,340
what type of ACP are we building across

1889
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:06,190
it is it just the normal a city that

1890
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:08,060
we're doing right now or would it be

1891
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:09,860
something different right so maybe

1892
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:11,960
that's one one piece to start from the

1893
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:17,330
bottom line with one component that we

1894
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:21,489
need I think to think there's a last

1895
01:56:17,330 --> 01:56:21,489
slide that asks a question

1896
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:29,240
right the question we've had comments

1897
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:31,550
and questions and we are close to the

1898
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:33,050
time limit so I think the real question

1899
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:35,960
is whether this is work that's

1900
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:38,450
interesting enough that we should go on

1901
01:56:35,960 --> 01:57:03,260
doing it or should we just forget about

1902
01:56:38,450 --> 01:57:06,260
it in my mind you know the ACP that you

1903
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:11,270
are currently pushing very hard for thee

1904
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:13,700
is G is very complex right and and the

1905
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:14,870
idea here which perhaps wasn't stated

1906
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:16,460
clearly enough at the beginning is to

1907
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:19,760
try and have something simpler for

1908
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:21,500
simpler scenarios if we can't make it

1909
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:32,840
simpler then there's no point making it

1910
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:37,790
at all yeah but that's protocols which

1911
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:40,310
run on IP transport one of the big areas

1912
01:57:37,790 --> 01:57:43,100
of complexity there is actually

1913
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:44,810
implementing what IP transport and high

1914
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:49,280
layer transfer protocols can give you

1915
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:54,080
that so basically facing fragmentation

1916
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:59,750
need reliable transmission and things

1917
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:02,960
like that don't you believe that it

1918
01:57:59,750 --> 01:58:05,810
might be such a case that if you remove

1919
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:08,180
some complexity or may be itself but in

1920
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:10,640
order for that functionality to to work

1921
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:13,700
you will need to add complexity Oh

1922
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:18,700
basically in the event lower transport

1923
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:18,700
layer or for this lightweight easy I

1924
01:58:20,230 --> 01:59:34,879
but yeah I mean it's really should

1925
01:58:27,650 --> 01:59:41,089
continue to explore this not will the

1926
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:43,350
rest periods it will be lot more

1927
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:49,500
exciting in the afternoon

1928
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:49,500
[Laughter]

1929
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:13,350
riki new chairs lunches tomorrow
