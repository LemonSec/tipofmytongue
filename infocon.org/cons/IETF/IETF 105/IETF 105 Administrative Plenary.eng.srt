2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,660

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,289
around for this portion of the plenary

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,390
so I didn't get to go outside during the

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,820
day yesterday but I heard that it that

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,160
it rained did anybody see a rainbow

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:43,370
yesterday no so we have a rainbow over

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,649
Montreal today I thought we could use

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:50,690
one so our agenda for today we're gonna

12
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:54,380
try to be quick so that we can get to

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,449
the open microphone sessions we'll have

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,329
a host presentation from our meeting

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,610
host here in Montreal and then brief

16
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,559
updates from myself

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,530
the IRT F chair the RFC series editor

18
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:10,670
the IV chair the ITF executive director

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:14,509
the ITF LLC board chair and the chair of

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,149
the NomCom we'll have a welcome from the

21
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,950
hosts from four IETF 106 our next

22
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:20,479
meeting and then we'll get to the open

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,319
microphone sessions and we're gonna time

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,630
limit the LLC board section and the ISC

25
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,300
section to ten minutes each so that we

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,568
have lots of time for the IAB open mic

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,310
and I think as people who were reading

28
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:37,880
the mailing list earlier today may have

29
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,190
seen based on requirements from the

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,490
hotel we are have to be out of this room

31
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,009
at 9 p.m. so we're gonna have to cut

32
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,690
ourselves off then unfortunately but

33
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:51,860
we'll try to be quick in this early part

34
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,539
so we have lots of time at the end so

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,270
first of all I'd like to extend a big

36
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,539

[Applause]

39
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,339
we can't put on these meetings without

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,509
the support of the host and as an

41
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,690

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,739
and Montreal is a great city to host the

54
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,530

to going back to Philadelphia we haven't

68
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,350
been there in a long time so thank you

69
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,350
Glenn

70
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:53,479
[Applause]

71
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:01,980
all right so moving on to my report

72
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,570
three topics today the first will spend

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,200
a moment on participant statistics for

74
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,060
this meeting talk a little bit about our

75
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,890
ongoing experiment with open time in the

76
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,290
meeting agenda and we'll talk a little

77
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:19,399
bit about conduct in the ITF so here you

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,800
can see our usual statistics for

79
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:25,010
participation had one thousand seventy

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
nine people on-site at this meeting

81
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,280
eerily similar to the number of people

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,340
we had on-site in Montreal last summer

83
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,130
we had one thousand 78 people on-site so

84
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,549
quite consistent not sure that was a

85
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,110
goal but we achieved it we had a hundred

86
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,890
and forty seven first-time attendees

87
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:50,370
pretty good number and participants from

88
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:52,229
48 countries here this time we started

89
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,479
off the week with the IETF hackathon on

90
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,310
Saturday and Sunday two hundred and

91
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,770
eighty on site on attendees so this is

92
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,240
our second largest hackathon ever not as

93
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,849
not as big as the one in Prague last

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,250
time but but still a fantastic turnout

95
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,350
people working on 42 different projects

96
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,360
it's become essentially a staple of the

97
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,940
ITF meeting week for a good chunk of our

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,260
population we had to hack them on happy

99
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,810
hour on Monday night where people

100
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,599
thought to advertise their projects and

101
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,370
spend a little bit more time talking in

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,680
depth with other participants about what

103
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,510
they had accomplished and the next one

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,030
will be happening the Saturday and

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:34,919
Sunday of the next IETF meeting November

106
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:37,559
16 and 17 in Singapore so the open time

107
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,510
the open agenda time experiment people

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,890
may realize that we're we've been doing

109
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,830
different versions of this experiment

110
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,630
for the last few meetings at the last

111
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,270
meeting we had open agenda time on

112
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:52,500
Wednesday afternoon had a big chunk of

113
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:56,659
open time and based on survey feedback

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,660
from the IETF 104 meetings survey

115
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:21,370
better okay now we're not giving people

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:24,099
seizures so after every meeting we do a

117
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,580
survey based on the survey feedback from

118
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,830
last time it was obvious that most

119
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,318
people were more interested in more

120
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,758
shorter slots of open time spread

121
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,759
throughout the week as opposed to one

122
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,169
long open slot on Wednesday afternoon so

123
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,389
that's what we tried at this meeting

124
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:44,229
we've had open time every morning from

125
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,879
8:30 to 9:45 with unofficial side

126
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,620
meeting rooms that people can sign up

127
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,599
for on a first-come first-served basis

128
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,629
and we had the Wharton group session

129
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,759
starting at 10:00 o'clock in the morning

130
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,990
even with this amount of open time in

131
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,819
the schedule we still had plenty of

132
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,259
slots to accommodate the number of

133
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:03,069
working groups and working group

134
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,330
sessions that wanted to meet in order to

135
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:05,529
figure out what we're gonna do next and

136
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,659
if we're going to repeat this experiment

137
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,060
or change it we need more feedback so

138
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,860
when you get the email on the 105

139
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,659
attendees list about the meeting survey

140
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,490
which will be going out hopefully at the

141
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:17,680
end of this week please fill it out

142
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,719
please give us your feedback what you

143
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,789
thought of this agenda whether you liked

144
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:23,409
the 10 o'clock start how you think we

145
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,870
should be structuring open time in the

146
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,310
future and any other feedback that you

147
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,569
have about how we can make the meeting

148
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,259
experience better for you and more

149
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,819
productive for you you can also send

150
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,139
feedback to the IHG directly if you

151
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:41,169
don't feel like filling out the survey

152
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:45,669
is G at ietf dot org we hosted hot RFC

153
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:47,620
on Sunday evening so this is a two-hour

154
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,000
session which is filled with lightning

155
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,340
talks designed to encourage

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,259
brainstorming help people find

157
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,299
collaborators raise awareness about new

158
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,000
ideas new drafts new initiatives in the

159

ITF promote side meetings and bar buffs

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,580

161
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,359
are available online again this is one

162
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,878
of those events that seems to be the

163
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,250
a fixture of the ITF meeting week and a

164
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:20,840
very big thanks to Aaron for continuing

165
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:21,919
to organize that so capably so I wanted

166
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,739
to spend a couple of minutes talking

167
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,219
about conduct in the IETF there's been

168
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,710
lots of discussion on the IETF mailing

169
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:34,070
the main ITF mailing list about this

170
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,769
recently and lots of discussion over the

171
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:40,490
last few meeting cycles dating back to

172
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:44,420
ITF the ITF 103 plenary that we had at

173
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,910
the end of last year we have guidelines

174
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,050
for conduct in the ITF they're enshrined

175
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,899
in BCP 54 and this is just kind of the

176
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,760
top line from that RFC it says that the

177
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,709
ITF strives through these guidelines for

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,300
conduct to create and maintain an

179
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:02,119
environment in which every person is

180
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,880
treated with dignity dignity decency and

181
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,680
respect I think there's actually a few

182
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,000
notable things about even just this one

183
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,910
sentence in particular this word strives

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,920
because I think the notion of creating a

185
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,949
positive and enriching culture in the

186
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,990
ITF it's not really like a box checking

187
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:22,729
exercise it's more of a journey and it's

188
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,380
probably a journey that we will always

189
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,740
be on it doesn't really have an end

190
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,689
point I think for some people they've

191
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,250
noted some particularly troubling

192
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,890
interactions on our mailing lists lately

193
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,350
and some even more troubling

194
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,910
interactions off off list recently and

195
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,500
so it might be that we're at a

196
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,529
particularly challenging moment in this

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,649
journey for me I think that means it's

198
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:47,329
an opportunity - for all of us to think

199
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,000
about what we can do

200
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:53,239
to course-correct to make improvements

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,290
to learn from our mistakes I know that

202
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,519
there are certainly things that I can do

203
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,410
better and there's mistakes that I've

204
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,750
made I might talk a little bit about

205
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,680
those in a few slides but I suspect that

206
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,560
there's things that we can do

207
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,180
collectively as well

208
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,029
the iesg talked about this a little bit

209
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,160
this morning and we feel as the

210
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:13,310
leadership our responsibilities both for

211
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,250
the toxic atmosphere that can sometimes

212
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,170
arise and for trying to make

213
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,020
improvements on the situation so we're

214
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:25,290
taking this

215
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:27,060
very seriously it's been revelatory even

216
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,430
for me these last few weeks to try to

217
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,010
understand the the full scope of all of

218
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,930
the documents that we have that describe

219
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,170
conduct in the IDF and there are

220
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,660
actually a lot of them and they go back

221
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,550
a long time this is not a new

222
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,829
conversation this is a conversation that

223
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:48,030
the ITF has been having for at least 20

224
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,790
years if not longer and these policies

225
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,110
are not necessarily in harmony once you

226
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,270
go and take a look at them

227
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,360
so if we go back to some of the earlier

228
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:00,449
ones the earliest ones we have working

229
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,120
group guidelines and procedures which in

230
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,790
one section talk about working group

231
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,010
chairs being able to intervene to cut

232
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,599
off disruptive behavior both in working

233
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,670
group sessions and on working group

234
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,480
mailing lists and the original RFC for

235
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,630
that dates to 1999 then we have the IETF

236
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,720
discussion list charter RFC 1305 which

237
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,730
was written in the year 2000 and that

238
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,200
one talks about inappropriate postings

239
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,940
on the ITF mailing lists and

240
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,600
specifically about unprofessional

241
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,710
commentary and that's the one that

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,750
create created this role of

243
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,170
sergeant-at-arms and allows the ITF

244
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,210
chair to designate people to serve as

245
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,000
who can help to moderate conduct on the

246
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,500
ITF mailing list then we have one about

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,210
revoking mailing list privileges in 2004

248
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,580
which is focused on denial of service

249
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,520
attacks that disrupt the consensus

250
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,230
process on the mailing list and in that

251
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,790
case it's the iesg which is responsible

252
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,650
for enforcing that one we have the

253
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,339
guidelines for conduct which I cited at

254
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,410
the beginning

255
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,090
originally published in 2001 that

256
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,209
document was obsoleted by a version that

257
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,680
was written five years ago and this one

258
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,740
is more of the has the more of the

259
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,689
positive valence talks about the

260
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,030
aspirational what we you know what we

261
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,120
aspire to extending respect and courtesy

262
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:23,069
to our colleagues and that one doesn't

263
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,070
really have any enforcement mechanism or

264
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,140
our personnel then a couple of years ago

265
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,320
we did the anti harassment policy and

266
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,760
the anti harassment procedures and that

267
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,709
one is more focused on

268
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,300
unwelcome hostile or intimidating

269
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:39,449
behavior actually goes into some great

270
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,609
detail defining what behavior that

271
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:44,839
constitutes and that's the one that

272
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,060
created the role of Ombuds team to field

273
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,970
confidential complaints about behavior

274
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,319
among individuals and then lastly we

275
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,810
have it also the meeting photography

276
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,760
policy which is the newest one which is

277
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,199
about which has a section which is about

278
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,579
ad-hoc photography in the ITF and how

279
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,920
people can can decline to be

280
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,540
photographed if they want to be so I

281
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,729
think that's kind of a summary of all of

282
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,349
the policies that we have about conduct

283
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:16,079
in the ITF there's been some recent

284
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,000
activity to try to stimulate a more

285
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,489
positive environment and there's also a

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,320
few ideas floating around just this

287
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,180
weekend going past going back a few

288
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,940
weeks that I wanted to let people know

289
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,709
about so the first is discussion between

290
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,839
area directors and working group chairs

291
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,029
about encouraging professional behavior

292
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,430
in the working groups this goes back to

293
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,800
IETF 103 when we had a significant

294
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,479
plenary discussion about this and the

295
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,490
ISD has been engaging with the working

296
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,459
group chairs since then to try to figure

297
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,470
out some guy some guidance essentially

298
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,199
to help worgen group chairs feel

299
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,000
empowered to intervene when they see bad

300
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,579
behavior and their working groups and to

301
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,160
try to encourage people to to be polite

302
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,189
and respectful so that's something that

303
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,300
the area directors are socializing

304
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,310
essentially one-to-one with their

305
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,979
working group chairs we really wanted to

306
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,510
do this as on a human level as a person

307
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,120
to person conversation with with the

308
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,720
chairs and it's also something that we

309
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,980
as area directors ourselves are are

310
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,329
using for introspection and thinking

311
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,569
about how we're applying this principle

312
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,529
when we engage in the IETF

313
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:22,079
we've gotten some assistance from

314
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:23,639
professional resources so there was a

315
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,050
group of us who met earlier this week

316
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,880
with an engineering engineering manager

317
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,040
who's responsible for positive community

318
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,500
building and one of the organizations

319
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,779
that participates in the IETF and he

320
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,910
provided a incredible wealth of insight

321
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,800
about things that we could do he had

322
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,240
read two months worth of our of our

323
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,660
mailing list so he was well educated

324
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,180
about some of what's going on here

325
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,339
and I think we may continue to rely on

326
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,370
his guidance and potentially seek some

327
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,190
other context from him to help us you

328
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,960
know develop what we do here we're also

329
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,360
thinking about training in combination

330
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,800
with that potentially leveraging some

331
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,080
professional assistance to do training

332
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,510
for the working group chairs for the

333
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,700
leadership possibly for others who might

334
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,280
be interested in some training about how

335
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,990
to handle specific situations you know

336
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,689
maybe some roleplay so I'm thinking

337
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,860
about particular scenarios that that can

338
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,380
get tricky in the ITF there's been some

339
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:24,430
activity around rotating the sergeant's

340
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,770
at arm's so a couple of years ago in in

341
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,650
May of 2017 we got two new sergeants of

342
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,730
arms after the previous set had served

343
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,090
about ten years

344
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,910
it's time for a refresh so at that time

345
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:39,190
Matt Miller and Ben Caidic agreed to

346
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,010
become new sergeant at arms for the ITF

347
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,260
discussion list people may know Ben

348
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,700
Caidic as the security ad he was

349
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,860
actually the sergeant at arms first

350
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,810
before he became the security ad so if

351
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,220
you don't want to be a security ad you

352
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,390
might want to think about not becoming a

353
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,570
sergeant at arms because apparently

354
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,880
that's the thing that happens but

355
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,580
basically since Ben joined the iesg last

356
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,870
year he's been asking me to replace him

357
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:08,020
and it has not been the highest priority

358
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,580
on my list for a few reasons there were

359
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,420
other things going on is one of those

360
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,920
reasons but also it never really seemed

361
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,780
like a burning issue because we have two

362
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,199
sergeants at arms so if there ever

363
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,400
seemed like there was a situation where

364
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,290
where it didn't it wouldn't seem correct

365
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,120
for Ben to intervene then we always had

366
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,480
Matt and of course myself

367
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,180
I'm also empowered by RC 3005 to to try

368
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,270
to help with the ITF discussion list so

369
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,489
as many things in the IETF didn't seem

370
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:40,120
like something that could turn into a

371
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,660
burning fire until it ignited which I

372
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,620
think it sort of has recently so I'm in

373
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,930
the process of looking for a new

374
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,520
sergeant at arms that's already started

375
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,089
I've done some outreach on that front

376
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:55,510
already and hope to be able to do that

377
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,040
fairly soon another thing that I think

378
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,650
we could do that's maybe demonstrated by

379
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,480
the

380
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,829
the litany of policies that I went

381
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,400
through earlier is to try to streamline

382
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,699
some of the documentation that we have

383
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,079
how we talk about conduct in the IETF

384
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,240
there's quite a bit of discrepancy

385
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,369
between all the various documents in how

386
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,439
we talk about it and so bringing some

387
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:18,800
harmony to that that set of concepts

388
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,959
might be useful and then finally

389
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,510
something that the sergeant-at-arms have

390
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,120
talked about this week and I think the

391
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,930
working group chairs may have as well is

392
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,939
clarifying some of the escalation

393
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,820
procedures so in the past it's been

394
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,950
somewhat ad hoc as to you know if you

395
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,669
see bad behavior on a mailing list do

396
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,840
email off list first do you how do you

397
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,220
send the signal to the rest of the

398
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,310
community that something's being dealt

399
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,930
with off list at least among the

400
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,060
sergeant's at arm's it's been someone ad

401
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,040
hoc like if we had already sent a

402
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,679
general warning on lists then maybe we

403
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,300
would carry forward on list but it

404
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,830
hasn't been consistent in every case and

405
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,040
I think that's quite problematic and

406
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,620
that's that's on us to fix so that's I

407
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,330
think something that that we can try to

408
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,280
do across the board in terms of being

409
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,350
more clear about what the escalation

410
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,330
procedures are for all these different

411
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,340
bodies that that handle conduct in the

412
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,659
IETF so those are just some things that

413
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,100
have been going on and some other

414
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,590
potential new ideas

415
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,990
the IHG very much wants to hear ideas

416
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,240
from you about what else we can do how

417
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,000
we can how we can be better on this so I

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,900
encourage your feedback either sent to

419
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,850
the IHG email alias to myself come to

420
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,750
the mic during the open mic we really

421
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:35,480
want to hear your ideas there's a bunch

422
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,610
more information covered online in the

423
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,990
ITF chairs report and other reports from

424
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,729
various other bodies so I encourage you

425
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:46,060
to check that out and Colin Perkins is

426
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,060
next

427
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,750
okay Thank You Alyssa my name is Colin

428
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,570
Perkins I'm the IRT F chair I just want

429
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:18,970
to give it a very brief report on the

430
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:21,760
IRT F so the IRT F is a parallel log as

431
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,130
an organization to the IETF which

432
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,600
focuses on the some of the long-term

433
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:31,300
research issues relating to the Internet

434
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,730
importantly the goal of the I RTF is

435
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,760
explicitly not to seek to develop or

436
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,890
influence the standards process rather

437
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,900
we try to promote research which is

438
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,910
relevant to the to the long term

439
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,000
evolution of the Internet and we do this

440
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,410
in the form of various research groups

441
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,850
the applied networking research prize

442
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,980
and the applied networking research

443
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:58,689
workshop we've tried to bring academics

444
00:19:50,980 --> 00:20:00,820
into the atf community we have 11 fully

445
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,030
chartered research groups free proposed

446
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,980
research groups six of these are still

447
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,340
to meet later in the week we have the

448
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,330
crypto forum research group the

449
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,399
computation in the network proposed

450
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,250
research group the network management

451
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
group the network coding group peffer

452
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,480
where networking and the measurement and

453
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,390
analysis of protocols finishing up on

454
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,280
friday if you're interested in any of

455
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,140
these topics please do get do go along

456
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,530
we've had some really good research

457
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,120
groups earlier in the week that the

458
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,970
privacy enhancements group in particular

459
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,699
earlier today had a bunch of stuff which

460
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:40,990
was very relevant to the technical

461
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,960
plenary talks in addition to the

462
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,940
research groups we run an academic

463
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,130
conference called the applied networking

464
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,890
research workshop which we organize in

465
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,990
collaboration with ACM sitcom this took

466
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,150
place earlier this week on the monday we

467
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,150
had about 200 people attending the

468
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,550
workshop really nice set of papers which

469
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,350
are all up online we're hoping to do

470
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,770
this again next year at the summer ITF

471
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,750
in Madrid next summer look out for the

472
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:12,010
call for papers just after Christmas

473
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:14,590
most likely finally we also run the

474
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,140
applied networking research prize this

475
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,168
is a prize awarded for recent research

476
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,609
results in

477
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:22,909
played networking research which are

478
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:25,639
relevant to bringing into the a IETF the

479
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:28,070
IETF community we had two really nice

480
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,469
talks yesterday that's at Rosen chef

481
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:34,070
gave a talk on NTP security with paper

482
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:37,159
on a protocol on implementation of NTP

483
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,989
called Chronos and CJ Chung give it a

484
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,619
really nice talk on the role of

485
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:44,119
registers and DNS SEC deployments we'll

486
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:46,999
have a couple more of these price talks

487
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,699
at the next IETF in Singapore and in

488
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:52,220
addition the nominations for the 2020

489
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,190
applied networking research price will

490
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,710
open in September October time frame so

491
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,289
if you know of any good applied

492
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:03,109
networking research papers please look

493
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:04,519
out for the call for nominations and let

494
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:07,070
us know so we can we can bring those

495
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:16,340
people into the the IETF the IRT f

496
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:19,600
community next year thank you thank you

497
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,600
come and next we have Heather

498
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:38,700
[Applause]

499
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,320
so you know what I'm gonna ask right

500
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,630
I've been working on this RFC format

501
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:50,290
project for a little while is this do

502
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:51,550
new to anybody here okay good um in case

503
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,889
this is a first meeting for you and

504
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,840
you're not familiar with this I have

505
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,730
been working with with the community

506
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,629
with the RFC production center with

507
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,640
really just about anybody I can on

508
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,160
taking us from the plaintext to ask you

509
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:12,450
only rfcs that we've been using for the

510
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:15,850
last 40-plus years to XML as the the

511
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:19,180
unchanging underlying format and having

512
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,870
outputs of text PDF a three as our rifle

513
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,790
target and HTML allowing SVG lineart

514
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,000
in black and white no we're not going to

515
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:31,389
do color because color is thinking hard

516
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,780
and allowing non ASCII characters there

517
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,610
is a FAQ sort of a very high-level FAQ

518
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,080
on the project available on the RFC

519
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,540
editor website and I'm we're now at that

520
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,169
sort of that last little bit of aligning

521
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:50,220
parts but the RFC production Center is

522
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:54,250
is targeting the end of August this year

523
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:57,820
not this this August to try and be ready

524
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:01,540
to be ready to publish v3 documents now

525
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,939
whether the tools will be ready rather

526
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,010
the ndn process will be ready there's

527
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,350
still a couple of open questions about

528
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,980
some details in the vocabulary whether

529
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,530
all of that will finally align is a

530
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,470
definitive maybe but I'm still very much

531
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,510
hoping that we'll see we'll see the

532
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:23,260
capabilities available come end of

533
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,970
August I want everyone to expect that

534
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,390
this is going to introduce several

535
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:30,820
months of debugging as we all learn some

536
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,700
new and interesting features and what to

537
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,040
expect out of the new format and it's

538
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,420
going to increase the workload for

539
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,399
pretty much everybody involved for the

540
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,620
authors who have more things to review

541
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,240
for the editors within the RSC

542
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,729
production center who also have a lot

543
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,670
more things to review

544
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:50,100
there's a couple of key links on these

545
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,780
slides and if you as I told the working

546
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,090
group chairs today if you take nothing

547
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,910
else away from my talk I'd really like

548
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,879
you to be looking at the XML to RFC v3

549
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,280
FAQ it answers a lot of questions that

550
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,070
people come to the desk and ask about

551
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,750
and I think it will help you and your

552
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,280
authors and your doctor shepherds and

553
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,750
really just about everybody understand

554
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,370
what's going on a couple other really

555
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,580
quick things that I'll jump through

556
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,899
since I know we are tight on time last

557
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,030
time I mentioned the service level

558
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,220
agreement that with the increased

559
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,790
workload it was extremely unlikely that

560
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,150
we would be meeting that later this year

561
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:32,010
now the LLC board has approved

562
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,900
temporarily two additional editors and

563
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:37,350
we're still searching for those as it

564
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,990
turns out the type of copy editors that

565
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,419
the RFC production center needs to edit

566
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:45,000
IETF documents are rather specialized

567
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,950
beasts and it's a little challenging to

568
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,010
to find folks that will be a good fit

569
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:53,340
but we're still working on that because

570
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,260
because the gods are unkind cluster 238

571
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,830
is expected to be releasing right about

572
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:02,040
now the last two documents are scheduled

573
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:04,889
for the ISDN iesg tell a chat on August

574
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:11,070
8th and that will drop about 2,000 pages

575
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:14,400
into queue thinks so implementation

576
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:16,470
expected in q3 we are requesting a

577
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,990
formal exception to the service level

578
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:22,620
agreement for q3 and q4 to just

579
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:25,410
recognize that it's pretty obvious as we

580
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,149
are as we the RFC editor are the primary

581
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,270
testers at this point in putting so much

582
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,530
time into this we're not going to get

583
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,879
through the editing of pages and so

584
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,560
let's acknowledge that we can't really

585
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,660
say here's how much time it will take

586
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,620
because the tools are still in process

587
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:45,210
we just don't know so hopefully that the

588
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,429
goal is to just understand that reality

589
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,520
get that documented for future reference

590
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,290
and move on

591
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,560
I have been sending out satisfaction

592
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,360
surveys and the whole purpose of that is

593
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,649
vendor evaluation

594
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,169
as probably no big surprise the we don't

595
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:07,440
get a lot of response about 17% response

596
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,299
rate almost everybody has been very

597
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,890
happy with the RFC editor I think we've

598
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,570
gotten one response that said well it

599
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:18,600
was okay but it would be better if you

600
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:20,790
use github so in terms of the narrative

601
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,159
trends because they're sort of this open

602
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,678
space of if you could do one thing to

603
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,570
improve this you know what what would

604
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,410
you see done really the one thing that

605
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:35,129
we hear consistently is improve off 48

606
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:37,230
now what improve off 48 means pretty

607
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,669
much I think every individual who's ever

608
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,500
put something through the queue has a

609
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,679
different opinion on what that means so

610
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,440
this is a really big project and I

611
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,559
highly recommend that this be sort of

612
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,210
the the priority for where we're my

613
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:54,000
biggest priority ended up being in terms

614
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,590
of projects the format work I think this

615
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,390
is your next big thing that you should

616
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,178
pay attention to to relieve this

617
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:03,419
particular friction from the RFC

618
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,710
publication process and someone did say

619
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:09,660
that more chocolate would be helpful

620
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:12,510
just just noting that one wanted to note

621
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,570
that there is a projects if those of you

622
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:18,120
who are following tools that may know

623
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,770
about the inline errata project code has

624
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,199
been written by Soaring hot consulting

625
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:25,040
that's Jim shod to create files with

626
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,720
erotic Corrections inline verified only

627
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,790
this is very sandbox II and we're doing

628
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,370
everything we can to highlight the fact

629
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:36,330
that no you can't refer to these as the

630
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:38,370
final document but enough people find

631
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,918
this to be just useful implementation

632
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,409
help that we want to make that available

633
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,010
so that's that's something that's

634
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:49,290
happening now I do have a call for

635
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,049
comment open this is the 50th year that

636
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,149
RFC's have been published and so as

637
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,129
there was a 30 years of RFC's and a 40

638
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,790
years of RCS there's 50 year of RFC's

639
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:04,650
out there and it is waiting for your

640
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:07,260
review and your comment elephant in the

641
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,909
room the RFC series editors decided not

642
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,149
to renew the contract at the end of 2019

643
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:14,559
I thought it would be just it was fun to

644
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,998
put together what what have we

645
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,678
accomplished because it wasn't just me

646
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:19,659
it was this room it was the RFC

647
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,809
production centre and we've done we've

648
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:24,669
done some pretty major things every year

649
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:26,109
since I started we've gotten finally

650
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:27,549
gotten a new website I don't know if you

651
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:32,379
all some of you might remember the old

652
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:35,499
website that was a little disappointing

653
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:38,228
for a technical organization to offer a

654
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:40,059
start updating a style guide which we

655
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:42,789
had been working against a draft on for

656
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,619
a very long time getting digital object

657
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:46,919
identifier z' assigned this was very

658
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:50,649
important in particular to the IRT F

659
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,809
going through the RFP process to award

660
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:56,258
the RFC production center and publisher

661
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:58,918
RFPs the getting the format

662
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:01,349
specifications published and sorted out

663
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,789
developing digital archive partnerships

664
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:06,999
digital archiving is actually a pretty

665
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:09,309
specialized field and it wasn't while

666
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:11,829
that is one of the key reasons that the

667
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:14,049
RFC editor exists to maintain the

668
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:16,149
archive of this material ongoing in the

669
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:18,549
future it's not really our area of

670
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,408
specialty so we've partnered with a

671
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,349
commuter Computer History Museum and

672
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:25,809
with the National Library in Sweden to

673
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:27,609
just keep ingesting our documents and

674
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:31,658
make sure we have other ways that they

675
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:33,279
can be stored in perpetuity and the new

676
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:34,839
RFC format rolling out this year I

677
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,659
really wanted to thank you all so very

678
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:41,070
much for making this less happen I

679
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:41,070
greatly appreciate your time

680
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,230
[Applause]

681
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,799
[Applause]

682
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,418
thank you truly thank you now um

683
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,820
some of you may have questions about

684
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:15,669
some of what I put together and rather

685
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,129
than have them lost in what might be

686
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:20,649
some some engaging conversation later

687
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:22,449
we've got a couple minutes if anyone has

688
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:28,809
any any open mic questions they want to

689
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:30,220
ask me now would be a good time Michael

690
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:31,928
Richardson I'm really excited about the

691
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,090
inline errata stuff since I'm dealing

692
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:35,409
with the router right now but I was a

693
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,609
bit dismayed when you told me we cannot

694
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:41,830
compel the references I know I do not

695
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:44,710
want to see those as the key reference

696
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,029
pointer within an RFC no I think that's

697
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,369
a bad idea

698
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:50,320
but I get a URL I can point people at oh

699
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:52,059
there's URLs you can you can talk about

700
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,820
it you can use it but when you start

701
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,830
going in your your RFC and say okay my

702
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:09,158
normative references foo you're not

703
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:11,668
going to point to that got it okay thank

704
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,669
you very much

705
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,949
Ted

706
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:40,059
so as you know one of the things the a

707
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,530
stands for is appointments in this case

708
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,270
we wanted to let the community you know

709
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,840
that Russ Hasley and Barry liebe would

710
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:48,400
be reappointed to the CCG that Richard

711
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,139
Barnes will serve a second term on the I

712
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,480
support thank you for service there and

713
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,809
that Jim Reed has been reappointed to

714
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,000
the ican our zerk the last thing on the

715
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:00,100
appointment slide is that the a B is

716
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,820
also currently seeking feedback on the

717
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,559
ITF delegate to the ICANN 2020 NomCom

718
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,389
the previous person was timed out so

719
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:12,129
these are all new candidates pleased to

720
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:14,770
take a look on the document side RC 85

721
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,090
46 and RCA 558 were issued during this

722
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,440
period we actually talked about them in

723
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,360
the draft stage and the last one so I'm

724
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,070
not gonna go into them as Heather just

725
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,570
pointed out 50 years of our FCS is

726
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,918
currently in community commentary

727
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,780
there's also some other ones the harmful

728
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,510
consequences of the robustness principle

729
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,160
the principles for operation of I Anna

730
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,990
registries that one in particular is

731
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,000
just an update to deal with the eye

732
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,160
asset changes so please don't assume

733
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,440
that there's a major change in operation

734
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,880
there and lastly document on the

735
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,750
long-term viability of protocol

736
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,220
extension mechanisms both the stack

737
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,870
evolution and privacy and security

738
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,220
programs have been operating for a

739
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,489
number of years and they have fulfilled

740
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,620
their basic goals each of them was an

741
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,870
evolution of a previous set of programs

742
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,729
and our current plan is to conclude both

743
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,620
of those in the near future and then

744
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,600
carry out any future work in other

745
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,510
programs or structures just to let you

746
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:12,639
know there were two workshops in the

747
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:15,879
recent timeframe DDR debtor was hosted

748
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,980
by Nokia in Finland in June and a bunch

749
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,210
of the explorations on it all the papers

750
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,060
are online please feel free to take a

751
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,859
look among the ones that we think are

752
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,840
most pressing are really that the

753
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:28,449
architectural changes implied in moving

754
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,340
functionality up the stack mean that

755
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,439
we're likely to see changes in

756
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,389
deployment patterns that result in

757
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,690
consolidation and centralization those

758
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,889
in turn create fragility and other kinds

759
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,770
of concerns you heard some of the

760
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,919
security concerns earlier today the

761
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,759
escape workshop which has got a long

762
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,129
acronym

763
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,169
was hosted at Cisco last week and it was

764
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,609
discussing web packaging and other

765
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:53,949
options in the space of web content

766
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,540
distribution with a particular emphasis

767
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:57,430
on the secondary effects on those

768
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,290
mechanisms and again consolidation is a

769
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,210
concern here and one of the reasons that

770
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,099
this was put together was to make sure

771
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,710
that the technical community actually

772
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:07,599
heard from the publisher community which

773
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:12,430
is often not a group that comes here to

774
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:16,869
the IETF as you know the IAB is also

775
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:18,730
chartered as a committee of the Internet

776
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:20,589
Society is an advisory committee to the

777
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,690
board and we have been consulting with

778
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:25,089
them on a number of things in particular

779
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,460
again on consolidation matter that was

780
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:31,180
raised in the Internet Society in the

781
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,430
global internet report so the last slide

782
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,640
on this builds on what heather was

783
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,440
saying earlier about the RFC setter

784
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,078
series editor search first we regret

785
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,910
that we're having to do a search and we

786
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:44,500
want to make sure that we engage in an

787
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,058
open discussion with you on how we can

788
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,420
move forward there's a lot of time at

789
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:51,790
the end of this for that but as noted in

790
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,880
the conversation with John cleanse in'

791
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,349
and again with brian carpenter later we

792
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,849
don't think that that conversation is

793
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,640
going to end tonight there are other

794
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:02,920
people who can't be in this room with us

795
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,348
either for Geographic reasons time

796
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,690
reasons or because they're parts of

797
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:09,970
communities who are customers rather

798
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,740
than authors of RFC's and it will take

799
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,020
some time to carry out that conversation

800
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,479
there is however a time critical

801
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,950
decision to be made on whether to go

802
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,950
ahead with the recruitment of a new our

803
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:24,129
RSC to facilitate the discussion on what

804
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:25,990
changes might be made and in particular

805
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,400
to be present in the system until

806
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,578
community discussion on the larger

807
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,690
issues may have concluded the other

808
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:36,369
possibility there is to leave the RFP

809
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,170
unissued for a period of time while the

810
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:40,089
community discussion goes forward and

811
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,010
one of the things that we're hoping to

812
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:44,200
do is to have a bit of discussion

813
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,760
tonight to kick off that particular time

814
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,819
critical part of it

815
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,760
olaf cokeman who served as the acting

816
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:54,640
RSC earlier and is one of the two

817
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,920
editors of the currently governing

818
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,808
document 66 35

819
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,000
we'll present a very short review of the

820
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:02,559
current model for those of you who may

821
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,960
not understand how the different moving

822
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,720
parts work together and frankly some of

823
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,309
it is pretty complicated and we hope

824
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,859
then to use the Open Mic time

825
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:16,349
productively to see how we can make this

826
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:16,348
go better in the future thank you

827
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:24,520
[Applause]

828
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,010

838
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,460
course we couldn't hold the meeting

839
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:44,890
without the equipment and I'm not sure

840
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,950
if I'm you all had a chance to make it

841
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:50,140
to the Hoff earlier but it's that

842
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:53,560
equipment that it's donated by the

843
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:56,470
sponsors that really make it make each

844
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,660
meeting seamless because I mean the

845
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,580
equipment is taken from one place or the

846
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,609
other and it just makes a big difference

847
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:07,720
in how the the Internet is coming into

848

attendance is 10 1059 remote

891
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:20,230
participants 651 visa ello eyes that

892
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:24,970
were issued 166 and then for

893
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:30,190
registration revenue that's 779 105

894
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:32,790
which is 97,000 730 above the budget so

895
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:36,430
we are really happy about that and then

896
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:41,350
sponsorship came just under our target

897
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:46,870
but those are our numbers for that and

898
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:49,020
again the registration breakdown thank

899
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,020
you

900
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:57,850
Thank You Portia and next we have Jason

901
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:09,080
thank you very much Alyssa

902
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:11,200
so we've gotten a lot done so we've been

903
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,930
in place now for four months and

904
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,149
bootstrapping an organization is always

905
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:18,350
fun and there's a lot of work activity

906
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,690
at the beginning and we are in that

907
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:24,110
highly intensive phase so I have a bunch

908
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:27,080
of updates to provide first who was on

909
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:30,230
the board you'll see some of us on the

910
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,029
stage Peter later on Peter is remote so

911
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,850
you'll see him on the video screen and

912
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,770
Maya is here as well in addition of

913
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:39,650
course to Alyssa and Shawn from the

914
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,660
community you may not recognize Shawn he

915
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:45,140
doesn't have a beard I have to say I'm

916
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,990
still freaked out by that so it's sort

917
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,850
of a problem that off to work through it

918
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:51,290
we are in terms of the meeting schedule

919
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,299
we're trying to do a couple things here

920
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,430
first we're trying to provide a lot more

921
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,200
advance notice of when we're meeting and

922
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,210
then what we're going to be working on

923
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,589
so we're doing a lot better in terms of

924
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,110
publishing an advance schedule of

925
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:05,390
meetings and of course agendas and we're

926
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,800
working to get better there so that's

927
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,020
one of the improvements that community

928
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,940
asked for we've gotten a lot of work

929
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,850
done so we had a two-day board meeting

930
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,010
in May to kick everything off we did

931
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,690
some assessments to basically look at

932
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,130
our strengths and weaknesses as an

933
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,350
organization and the external

934
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,180
environment and how it may affect the

935
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:25,370
ITF in the long term and how we want to

936
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,450
mitigate those risks to the extent there

937
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:31,609
are any we issued a bunch of RFPs we

938
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,439
began a search for an executive director

939
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,870
and I'll give detailed updates on some

940
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,640
of these later we put in place a whole

941
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:40,190
bunch of insurance coverages that are

942
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,009
required and that we're also recommended

943
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,110
we began a policy consultation process

944
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:48,040
and created a consultation process as

945
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:51,080
well of course we had the unexpected

946
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,970
export regulation thing come up and so

947
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,940
we had to deal with that on an ad-hoc

948
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,680
basis and we've done some contract

949
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,990
extensions and I'll talk later about the

950
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,940
last item so in the next few months what

951
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,578
is the next few months look like for

952
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,280
we've got an executive director a

953
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:10,010
permanent one to put in place we need to

954
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,960
institute and finalize the policies that

955
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:15,049
we have and a bunch of other things that

956
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,430
are here it's a lot and so I'm gonna

957
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:19,640
talk about some of the details in a

958
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:20,270
second this is the budget and where we

959
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,710
stand

960
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:24,319
all of these every time that we meet

961
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:27,049
every month we publish these suffice to

962
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,400
say basically were on budget that's

963
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:30,440
really the key message here you don't

964
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,510
need to know much more for now the

965
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,329
budget process for 2020 is about to

966
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:37,099
begin and I guess I would really say to

967
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:38,690
the interim board that preceded us

968
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:41,299
thanks for putting us in a good position

969
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:43,819
and thanks for I Sauk support and

970
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:45,710
sponsor support you know for basically

971
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:47,270
putting us in a firm footing for this

972
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,039
year where we don't feel like we've just

973
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:52,190
formed and we have to go ask for more

974
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:54,980
money or something like that so 2020

975
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:56,809
budgeting will be important for us in

976
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,750
terms of operating reserve this has been

977
00:45:56,809 --> 00:46:03,109
talked about before we have one that's

978
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:05,329
good as of now it's really invested in

979
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:07,160
in short-term instruments and so one of

980
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:09,920
the to-do items or actions that we have

981
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,348
is to develop an investment policy

982
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,510
strategy to really guide what do we do

983
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:16,640
with that money how much of it has to be

984
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,440
in a short term investment so you can

985
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,980
get at it quickly if you need to in an

986
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:26,210
emergency versus what can be invested in

987
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:28,670
a more long term basis in terms of the

988
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:32,480
endowment this is really new news so

989
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:34,309
thank you too I sock just days ago they

990
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,740
were able to complete the transition of

991
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:39,619
the ietf endowment from the Internet

992
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,450
Society to the ITF and that was a big

993
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:43,339
deal it took a lot of doing on the part

994
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,770
of I Sauk staff and we really appreciate

995
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:47,328
that I will say that these numbers as

996
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,009
you look at them probably don't make

997
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:50,990
much sense in some cases they don't

998
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:53,119
really quite add up because of some of

999
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,000
the oddities here and I will sort of say

1000
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,770
the key here is that the current balance

1001
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,720
is what's important to pay attention to

1002
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,210
we have roughly three million dollars in

1003
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,459
the endowment and if our goal is to be

1004
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,220
able to fund annual operations out of

1005
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,380
the income generated by the endowment we

1006
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,609
have nowhere near enough money so we

1007
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:14,459
need to really in the next few

1008
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:16,140
in the next year develop a strategy for

1009
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:18,269
how are we going to go about raising

1010
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,519
more funds for this endowment so that

1011
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:22,258
that might become a possibility and of

1012
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,828
course as well how should that money be

1013
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:27,390
invested over time similar to the the

1014
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:30,269
fund that we talked about a moment ago

1015
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:33,029
this reserved for the endowment itself

1016
00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:34,379
we need an investment policy and at the

1017
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:36,089
at the current time we've really just

1018
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,839
mirrored how I sock had that money

1019
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:41,940
invested as a placeholder until we can

1020
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:43,469
get to focus on this so we've got a lot

1021
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,660
to do of course we reached out to the

1022
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:48,359
major donors and I think it's important

1023
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,769
to recognize their generosity so far

1024
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,719
that's really important both the

1025
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:54,118
individual donors as well as the

1026
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,029
institutional organizations that backed

1027
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,729
the endowment and we appreciate that and

1028
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:01,559
we'll be working with them as we develop

1029
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:03,689
this sort of future strategy and

1030
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,680
figuring out what new organizations

1031
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:10,940
might be future donors for this the

1032
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,769
Secretariat services RFP we put that out

1033
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,569
obviously the current secretary that's

1034
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:17,430
been doing a fantastic job this meeting

1035
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:20,249
is another example of how smoothly

1036
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:21,749
everything just runs it's great it just

1037
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:24,390
sort of happens and works which is

1038
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:26,968
wonderful but we didn't happen to notice

1039
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:29,670
that the current contract ended first

1040
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:32,009
rather soon and also a matter of a few

1041
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,099
weeks before the next IETF meaning we

1042
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:36,569
thought that was sort of problematic and

1043
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:38,670
unnecessarily risky so we extended it to

1044
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:40,650
the end of the year and that gave us a

1045
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,390
little bit more time to issue the RFP

1046
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,999
and the other thing that we're trying to

1047
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,288
do is to try to simplify over time the

1048
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:48,959
way that some of the contracts are

1049
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:50,819
structured over time just as you know

1050
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:53,430
things happen a lot of things got

1051
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:55,650
bundled up into contracts and it can

1052
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,719
make things complicated to understand

1053
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,359
and so we've tried to break those up

1054
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,400
it's not any reflection that things are

1055
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,989
going badly in any sense it's just we're

1056
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,920
trying to simplify things and make them

1057
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:10,670
easier to manage and administer this is

1058
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,229
a big one so the search for a permanent

1059
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:15,749
executive director the key here is

1060
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:18,448
really astounding a hundred and

1061
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:20,549
thirty-four applications we were blown

1062
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:23,090
away by this we were very worried that

1063
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:25,190
we would have too few applicants

1064
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:28,820
and so from my standpoint I am

1065
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,980
incredibly humbled that we had 134 very

1066
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,260
qualified applicants for this role and

1067
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,230
of that as we went through we had a very

1068
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,490
difficult time doing a first cut of

1069
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:39,530
those candidates to sort of pick the

1070
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:41,540
ones that should be interviewed in the

1071
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:43,970
first round and I think it's a great

1072
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,880
reflection on the strength of this

1073
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,410
community and what the ietf means to the

1074
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,240
internet and to the world

1075
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,240
that so many highly qualified people

1076
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,669
said they're interested in this position

1077
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,229
and I think that's just a great thing it

1078
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,510
just means that in the short term for us

1079
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,120
we've got a lot of work to do to sort of

1080
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:04,280
sort through all of those candidates but

1081
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:07,040
it's amazing to me and I think we're

1082
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,750
again as I said really humbled by the

1083
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,860
level of interest in that and it's it's

1084
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:15,530
really great policies consultation so we

1085
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,390
began that in the early part of June and

1086
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,860
this was the first time that we did it

1087
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,569
so the first thing we did upfront and

1088
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,060
said what should our process look like

1089
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:25,160
for consultation this came out really in

1090
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,900
the ISO to working group the

1091
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,120
expectations that the community had

1092
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,550
about how they wanted to be involved and

1093
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,870
consulted with and so we created a

1094
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,340
project on github that's where the

1095
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,529
documents went people could submit

1096
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:39,080
issues there if they wanted to we also

1097
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:41,450
created a general consultation email

1098
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,549
list and comments could go there we did

1099
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,200
a live webinar which was then recorded

1100
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,330
and available for people to watch later

1101
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,910
on and we began then a month-long

1102
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,410
consultation period and where we stand

1103
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,180
now we've been a bit busy preparing for

1104
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,040
this meeting so we've collected a bunch

1105
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,020
of those things and over the coming

1106
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,180
weeks we'll be reviewing them and then

1107
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,910
deciding which of the policies need to

1108
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,520
be revised and whether those revisions

1109
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,350
get to a level of significance where we

1110
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,290
need to go out again for consultation

1111
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:12,259
and I don't think we know that yet and

1112
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:14,120
then as a last item not only do we then

1113
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,790
have to implement the policies but we

1114
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,620
have to put first meaningful training or

1115
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:20,840
information sharing about what those

1116
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,819
mean and how to comply with them but

1117
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,250
then sort of a checkup checkup

1118
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,780
compliance policy on the back end so

1119
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:29,090
that we're actually following those

1120
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,620
things which is important so I think

1121
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,630
those are all the updates here are all

1122
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:35,759
the many many ways to follow us how

1123
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:38,609
contact us and the stuff you can find us

1124
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:40,200
all online so no need to hash this out

1125
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:42,328
but those are the updates and we'll be

1126
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:49,200
up on stage later on to take any

1127
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:53,960
questions so thank you very much thank

1128
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,960
you Jason next we have Victor

1129
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,650
alright this will be a quick update on

1130
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,950
the NomCom committee that we're forming

1131
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:15,049
for this upcoming selection year first

1132
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,359
of all I like coming to Montreal in the

1133
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:19,940
summer it's a much nicer time of year

1134
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,980
and it's a nice place to gather for the

1135
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,790
first time with the new committee sorry

1136

1149
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,640
so people can recognize them for their

1150
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:54,350
hard work as they're going to be in many

1151
00:52:52,640 --> 00:53:02,560
many meetings

1152
00:52:54,350 --> 00:53:05,480
[Applause]

1153
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:08,570
they've decided to slave a little extra

1154
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,150
for the next year so I'm excited as we

1155
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:14,420
get going we've convinced them to

1156
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:16,520
volunteer and they have and we get to

1157
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,589
take a lot of feedback and so that will

1158
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,509
be something a lot of time reading

1159
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:22,339
through all the community feedback we

1160
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:24,920
enjoy having a lot of feedback I'll

1161
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:27,259
remind the community many times that we

1162
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,780
will love to have feedback it's the way

1163
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,940
we're able to understand what the

1164
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:34,310
community needs and wants and for us to

1165
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:38,630
be able to do the right thing for the

1166
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:40,790

1167

00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,660
details you can that helps us kind of

1185
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:34,009
Whittle through and understand what is

1186
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:38,328
it that you're thinking what is that you

1187
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:39,680
want this is a quick list it's on the

1188
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:41,510
web page a little hard to read here

1189
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,310
fonts a little small but we have a

1190
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,720
proposed schedule we'll get that

1191
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,040
hardened out over the next couple of the

1192
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,118
weeks and get that make sure we have it

1193
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,410
firmed up a lot of work as we get into

1194
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,450
the next couple of months we'll get the

1195
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,640
questionnaires done we'll do the call

1196
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,470
for our nominees and it will prepare for

1197
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,150
interviews or the majority of interviews

1198
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:04,578
in Singapore so it'll be a big week for

1199
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:07,010
the NomCom just so folks understand the

1200
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:10,099
first year which was last year we we

1201
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:13,010
filled three a 1 a 2 and a 3 year role

1202
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:14,690
for both the I ITF trust and the

1203
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,960
see and that was to be able to seed it

1204
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:20,660
so that we can have a single nominee

1205
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,280
moving forward each successive year so

1206
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,200
this year we'll fill the one role as I

1207
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,720
mentioned earlier but last year we had

1208
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,009
done the three the a one-time basis to

1209
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,410
kind of seed it for though we'll have an

1210
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:35,320
offsetting

1211
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:38,569
cast of board members so as a reminder

1212
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,800
feedback feedback is amazing I put it

1213
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,810
three times there you can see how

1214
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,910
important it is the other thing I would

1215
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,770
like to remind everyone is please please

1216
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:48,259
please if you know someone was qualified

1217
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:50,300
and you think that they would be a great

1218
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,490
candidate for one of the roles please

1219
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,930

1220
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:56,120
nominate yourself as well if you feel

1221
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:59,149
you're qualified but please look around

1222
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:03,620
talk to your fellow IETF firs it's great

1223
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:05,570
to have a wide cast of nominees it's a

1224
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:08,150
great experience to go through it even

1225
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:12,650

so for ITF 106 Nokia will be pleased to

1235
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:54,420
welcome you in Singapore so Nokia is not

1236
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:56,580
immediately related to Singapore but we

1237
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,290
do have a location out there which is

1238
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:02,160
serving the Asian markets so we are kind

1239
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,880
of locals Singapore in November so we

1240
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,970
have already been there

1241
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,710
we know how it is it's an enjoyable

1242
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:10,500
place we know that there is a diverse

1243
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:12,390
culture plenty of good food and we may

1244
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,070
not notice when we are freezing in our

1245
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,020
meeting rooms but it's also tropical

1246
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:18,420
weather out there so you will find out

1247
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,750
that there are tropical forests and you

1248
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:24,360
have beaches so you can get ready for

1249
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:25,370

[Music]

1276
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:35,990
Thanks

1277
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:38,419
all right Leslie deagle um Jason you

1278
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,368
mentioned in your remarks that among the

1279
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,829
things that the very very busy new LLC

1280
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:46,789
board is doing is looking at planning

1281
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:48,740
how to simplify the contracts I don't

1282
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:50,809
like to hear that expressed in terms of

1283
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,970
what is the strategic level objective

1284
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:55,009
that the LLC board has and how is your

1285
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:58,578
new executive director going to

1286
00:59:55,009 --> 01:00:01,400
implement it so like why are we easy

1287
00:59:58,579 --> 01:00:02,930
simplifying or why is the LLC board

1288
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,160
worried about what the contracts looked

1289
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,660
like it seems to me that that's

1290
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,160
dangerously close to getting into the

1291
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,598
kind of nitpicking stuff as opposed to

1292
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,420
the high level strategic stuff that the

1293
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:12,829
LLC board was designed to do but I may

1294
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,049
have missed the point and I'd like to

1295
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:17,119
hear how you have a strategic objective

1296
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:20,509
that you're going to get the new

1297
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:22,400
executive director to implement you know

1298
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:24,950
from a contract standpoint it's it's

1299
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,589
sort of you know the more complicated

1300
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:29,480
that you make a contract the harder it

1301
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:31,549
is to understand the harder it is to

1302
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,099
make sure that everyone agrees and is

1303
01:00:31,549 --> 01:00:37,160
aligned on what the responsibilities are

1304
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:38,569
and so on so I think that's the idea and

1305
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,670
breaking them apart is making them a

1306
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:43,160
little bit simpler more comprehensible

1307
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:45,470
okay so you're telling me if I'm hearing

1308
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:48,170
it correctly is that the LLC board would

1309
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:50,078
like to ensure that there is ease and

1310
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,980
clarity for all the understand the

1311
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,990
contracts and this is a high level

1312
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,170
priority in the establishment of this

1313
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:59,868
organization it's a high level objective

1314
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:02,180
it's part of the normal you know legal

1315
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:04,910
aspect and of the administration of this

1316
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:15,078
stuff yeah right well I'll probably see

1317
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:17,089
you in the next time Mike thanks can

1318
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:19,700
compete both sorry yeah

1319
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:22,490
so as people may have seen on the ietf

1320
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:25,009
list I've put out a draft called draft

1321
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:29,118
Lear we've got to stop meeting like this

1322
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:30,770
now the purpose of that trap is really

1323
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:34,850
simply to

1324
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:37,490
engage the LLC to start and UD perhaps

1325
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:39,470
to start thinking about new modalities

1326
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:41,359
of how we should be meeting with an eye

1327
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:43,720
towards it's not only effectiveness but

1328
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:47,890
also how we preserve the environment

1329
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:50,359
cost and a litany of other things the

1330
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:52,250
purpose of the draft is not to specify

1331
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,900
answers in fact I don't even know if we

1332
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:57,290
have I have the right questions in the

1333
01:01:53,900 --> 01:02:00,320
draft but rather to have somebody who

1334
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:04,640
can look at this in a long-term way as

1335
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:08,270
you put up a list of meeting dates we

1336
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:10,220
tend to get backed up in terms of you

1337
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:13,250
know thinking three four or five years

1338
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,868
in advance so any change we might want

1339
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:17,240
to even consider even an experimental

1340
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:18,920
level can take a while so the purpose of

1341
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,600
me standing here is to say first of all

1342
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,360
could people who cut the community

1343
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,130
please perhaps provide some comment on

1344
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,110
that draft and then perhaps could you

1345
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:30,580
take that forward as you see fit in

1346
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:32,840
consulting consultations with the iesg

1347
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,990
yep thanks I'll say certainly we

1348
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,369
definitely noticed the draft I thought

1349
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:39,439
it was interesting to read and we're

1350
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:41,869
watching all the community discussions

1351
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,730
so you know as community consensus

1352
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:46,520
develops you know that will help provide

1353
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:48,560
direction timing-wise to the extent that

1354
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,390
we wanted to follow some of your

1355
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,940
recommendations for example around a

1356
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:54,710
consultant to help do some assessment or

1357
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,840
something given that we're beginning the

1358
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:58,760
budget process soon you know the timing

1359
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,350
may be convenient between now on the end

1360
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,150
of year something like that wanted to be

1361
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:04,368
budgeted but we'll certainly keep an eye

1362
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:06,609
on what the community discussion is and

1363
01:03:04,369 --> 01:03:11,359
assess you know how to move forward

1364
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:15,460
Thanks and you want to add something you

1365
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:18,859
know we have a meeting location policy

1366
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:21,170
which calls for a specific rotation on

1367
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:23,180
specific time scale so there is some

1368
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,490
intersection between your proposal and

1369
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:27,049
that and that would be system since the

1370
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:29,149
policies documented in what is now going

1371
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:31,490
to be a consensus RFC that would be a

1372
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:33,810
matter for community consensus to be

1373
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:36,299
determined

1374
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,279
I totally understand but we don't the

1375
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,470
point is actually just to figure out

1376
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,810
where we might want to go the the draft

1377
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:44,790
basically calls for the for the LLC and

1378
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,590
the ISU to maybe bring some ideas back

1379
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:48,060
to the community and then to take it

1380
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,800
forward from there so sort of step by

1381
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:52,650
step and if we need to make changes in

1382
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:57,420
documents later we do that later okay

1383
01:03:52,650 --> 01:04:00,150
Bob hi Bob Hindon so nice to report

1384
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,580
earlier I'm glad we're on budget so I

1385
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,620
was looking at the budget and particular

1386
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,350
I was comparing it against the previous

1387
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:09,600
year's budget and so what I noticed is

1388
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:12,210
that the previous year the total

1389
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,790
expenses were a little over seven

1390
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:18,260
million dollars seven million twenty

1391
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:20,759
nine five five five nine nine but the

1392
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:23,310
expenses for this year you know

1393
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,400
basically the first LLC budget was

1394
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:29,790
almost eight point seven million dollars

1395
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:34,470
so pretty much one point six million

1396
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:36,960
dollars more to have the LLC and it

1397
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:39,779
seems like quite a lot to me so I was I

1398
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,970
to questions relating to this I'd like

1399
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,550
you to tell us why it's going up so much

1400
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:46,259
and I'd also like to know why you didn't

1401
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:48,600
talk about this ever

1402
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:51,330
earlier because it's a you know a pretty

1403
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,690
significant change that's the difference

1404
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:57,990
is close to the cost of to you know meet

1405
01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:00,360
a meeting and a half of ITF meetings

1406
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:03,569
it's you know yeah this is a lot of

1407
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,220
money sure sure so I'm going to defer to

1408
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:07,080
our treasurer in a second I would say

1409
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,299
that the budget was developed by the

1410
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:12,210
interim board you know so it was

1411
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:14,640
established you know late last year and

1412
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,620
I think has been discussed you know

1413
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,680
since that time but Shawn do you want to

1414
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:20,970
speak to I think some of the cost

1415
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,230
differences come down with trying to

1416
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,939
figure out who was doing what to whom

1417
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:26,070
with respect to I saw him paying for

1418
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,170
things and it's basically trying to just

1419
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:31,320
lay out what the real costs were and

1420
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:33,800
that's that started before and we're

1421
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,630
gonna continue to do that going forward

1422
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,300
well that's a pretty in general answer I

1423
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:41,000
would like to sort of get a lot more

1424
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,280
specifics from that to under

1425
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,710
and what's I mean this is a significant

1426
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:49,610
increase in the overhead costs of the

1427
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:52,430
IDF so I think that you know I'm not

1428
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:55,130
expecting you to do it this second but I

1429
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:58,580
think some more more responses of why

1430
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:01,220
why these extra expenses are being kurd

1431
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:03,319
and what we're getting for it and you

1432
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:07,069
know why it's justified thank you I'll

1433
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:08,870
take a note Thanks so we can follow up

1434
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:10,940
in more detail but just a few things I

1435
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:14,569
think as you know Bob the ITF budget has

1436
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:16,460
increased every year as long as I can

1437
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,930
remember not by this much but it's not

1438
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,940
as if the entire increase is

1439
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:21,910
attributable solely to the transition to

1440
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:24,610
the LLC because it increases every year

1441
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:27,680
we did talk about this when we were

1442
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,390
forming the LLC and you know in the

1443
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,470
working group process and on in the

1444
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,790
interim board I think I'm the only

1445
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:35,600
person here who was on the interim board

1446
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:37,250
so so there was a bunch of discussion

1447
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,759
about this at the time when we created

1448
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:42,830
the budget a year ago and then and

1449
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,040
obviously a bunch of it is accountable

1450
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:47,360
to salaries that we that we budgeted for

1451
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,830
this year but aren't actually paying out

1452
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,350
because we haven't hired the people we

1453
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:52,759
didn't know the timing of the hiring but

1454
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:55,069
we had to budget as if it was a whole

1455
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,140
years worth of expenditure even though

1456
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:59,150
the people haven't been hired and then

1457
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:01,580
lastly just to note our revenue also

1458
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:03,410
increased significantly because we got a

1459
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:05,870
much larger contribution from I sock

1460
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:09,049
this year than we have in any prior year

1461
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:11,779
so it's not as if we're you know in

1462
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:14,630
danger of being underwater as a result

1463
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:16,180
of this but good questions we'll take it

1464
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:18,290
as an action item and follow back up

1465
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:21,770
additional questions we've got a couple

1466
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:23,900
minutes left Mike Bishop I wanted to

1467
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:28,190
follow up on your comment that the

1468
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:30,560
endowment needs to grow further the

1469
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:32,240
endowment webpage has not been accepting

1470
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,150
donations since around the end of last

1471
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,859
year and now the endowment web page as

1472
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,480
of sometime very recently gives you a

1473
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:41,960
certain error and then a 404 if you

1474
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,520
proceed past that yep I kind of think if

1475
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,790
we want more money we might want to

1476
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:49,710
start accepting it yeah no that's an

1477
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:51,720
excellent point we made a decision to

1478
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:52,680
and during the transition period for a

1479
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,600
short period of time

1480
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,819
take that down because it would be

1481
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,339
unclear what bank account

1482
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:01,170
it could be accepted into and it was

1483
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:03,060
difficult from an accounting and sort of

1484
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:06,240
paperwork standpoint to have a definite

1485
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:08,759
cut date for moving it over I think we

1486
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,109
also felt that we wanted to have a

1487
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,330
chance and there'll be community

1488
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:14,280
consultation of course with this sort of

1489
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:18,210
articulate what the long-term goals are

1490
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:20,130
and to you know explain this and put up

1491
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,660
a new page and so on so you know that's

1492
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:24,660
gonna go out eventually to community

1493
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:26,460
comment and you know we're in an interim

1494
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,080
period but I agree you can't accept more

1495
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,260
money if you don't have a page to accept

1496
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,210
it I think though at the same time a lot

1497
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,250
of the the places that we're going to go

1498
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:38,160
aren't places that might donate on a

1499
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:39,540
webpage so you know it depends what our

1500
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:44,550
target audience is and that's part of

1501
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:47,340
that assessment that will do it

1502
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:50,010
certainly you know hiring and smarf peas

1503
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:53,750
are probably in the queue beforehand

1504
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:57,000
it's next few months I think is our goal

1505
01:08:53,750 --> 01:09:04,560
and last comments and then we have to

1506
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:08,069
close up parallel with them in what way

1507
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,380
are two contracts that they find to

1508
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:14,160
functions and they interface between

1509
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:18,870
them simpler than one contracts that

1510
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:25,410
defines two functions I mean I was a bit

1511
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:27,540
confused by this striving towards making

1512
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:29,670
more contracts because my experience is

1513
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,500
that more contracts creates more

1514
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:34,950
interfaces which creates more confusion

1515
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,350
with grapes more trouble and the last

1516
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:40,290
thing you want a trouble and it's

1517
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:42,390
micromanagement by the board Cate

1518
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:43,950
comment yeah I know I don't think it's

1519
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:46,140
micromanagement at all I think it's just

1520
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:48,809
doing our job to reduce risk and make

1521
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:53,070
things more clear and simple and in

1522
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:54,930
particular I think that it might be one

1523
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:56,849
perspective to say that you know two

1524
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:58,740
contracts is more complicated than one

1525
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:00,240
but at the same time when you come in

1526
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:02,790
and you look at an agreement and you try

1527
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,660
to figure out well this service is

1528
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:09,420
particulars peaches does apply to that

1529
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:11,760
it's very complicated when over time you

1530
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:14,250
keep adding to an existing contract and

1531
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,680
at some point the underlying contract

1532
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:19,260
isn't fit for the purpose of some of the

1533
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,580
add-on services and so we're trying to

1534
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,420
bring clarity here it's not about

1535
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:27,180
micromanagement and you know we're

1536
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:29,510
trying to again make it more clear and

1537
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:36,420
easy to understand over the long term so

1538
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:39,060
I would be very happy to see you make

1539
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:41,280
hire someone who knows how to run

1540
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:46,230
contracts and interfaces between them

1541
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:50,540
and give them the power to decide so yes

1542
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:53,099
do figure out what the functions are but

1543
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:55,950
when it comes to legal stuff leave it

1544
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,390
through professionals please yeah I hear

1545
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,309
ya we'd have to only have a legal

1546
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:01,980
counsel and that's a core part of our

1547
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:04,080
agreement thank you all right thanks

1548
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,700
very much for your time yeah I think

1549
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,430
we're we're closed in terms of time

1550
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:12,219

1572
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:07,800
following up your something from your

1573
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:10,199
report Alyssa you I want to say thanks

1574
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:13,530
to the isg for recognizing the issue

1575
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:15,749
with regards to tone on mailing lists

1576
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:17,280
and so on and so forth and and also

1577
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:19,648
taking on some responsibility for

1578
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:25,169
addressing that but I think I'd also

1579
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:26,609
like to say we are you and you are us it

1580
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:29,989
was interesting to hear that you've had

1581
01:13:26,609 --> 01:13:33,479
some input from professional

1582
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:34,949
communications management people I'd be

1583
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:36,989
curious to know what it was that they

1584
01:13:34,949 --> 01:13:37,888
shared with you and you know could you

1585
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:39,480
share it with us

1586
01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:42,030
and

1587
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:44,339
in large part because while I recognize

1588
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,690
this is the is G this is the current is

1589
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,210
G in March there will be a slightly

1590
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:51,388
different eyes she so it's sort of like

1591
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:54,239
educating all of us educates not only

1592
01:13:51,389 --> 01:13:56,460
this is G but all future ones to thanks

1593
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:59,699
totally yeah we were super lucky that

1594
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,619
this man my koi was able to drive over

1595
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:04,290
from his house and meet with a few of us

1596
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:06,599
but definitely plan to distill

1597
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:08,489
everything that we have learned and will

1598
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,800
continue to learn so everyone can

1599
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:15,989
benefit from it Martin yeah man Thompson

1600
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,630
um to further Leslie's point I think

1601
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:20,968
that I personally like to make a

1602
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:22,440
commitment here and I encourage others

1603
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:24,989
to do the same

1604
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,699
I felt constrained for in the recent

1605
01:14:24,989 --> 01:14:31,400
discussions I didn't feel like I could

1606
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:33,419
say anything and I realized recently

1607
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,659
slightly in the conversation with Mike

1608
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:38,400
that we had earlier this week that

1609
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:43,559
standing by and letting this bad

1610
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:48,299
behavior occur is me being part of the

1611
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:51,480
problem so in addition to me being

1612
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,400
respectful of others and the diversity

1613
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,699
of opinions that we have here and the

1614
01:14:53,400 --> 01:15:02,759
great set of people that form this

1615
01:14:56,699 --> 01:15:06,210
community I plan to be less tolerant of

1616
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,710
bad behavior and others and I'd

1617
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,710
encourage others to do so as well

1618
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:19,660
[Applause]

1619
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:22,880
Thank You Martin dan Danville damaged

1620
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:26,660
about the some feedback from ASEAN Nam

1621
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:30,230
Kham member recruiting candidates for ad

1622
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:32,480
positions is really hard as you probably

1623
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:35,360
know but I really want the whole

1624
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:37,429
community to hear that because lately it

1625
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,290
was a very interesting comment that I

1626
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:41,510
heard when trying to get some people to

1627
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:43,640
nominate for a be and asking them if

1628
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:46,730
they will be interested oh it's a career

1629
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:52,760
death sentence I still want to do

1630
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:55,250
development work and we have to think

1631
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,960
about that how we can solve that the

1632
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:59,720
other part also what the ADIZ are saying

1633
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:02,510
well there's one thing that is in the

1634
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,820
job description in the other part what

1635
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:08,390
is the actual work that we have to do

1636
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:13,639
there is a very specific way how to lead

1637
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:15,950
a volunteer organization and we have to

1638
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:20,360
think about that learn how to do that

1639
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:24,019
and then based on that grow and groom

1640
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:25,700
you know the potential leaders but it is

1641
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,960
I don't think this is enough to be

1642
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:29,870
discussed within the NomCom

1643
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:33,140
or within the bias read this has to be a

1644
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:36,410
wider problem of the whole community

1645
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:38,690
because at one point the people who are

1646
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:47,960
rotating through their leadership

1647
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:49,969
positions will retire and then what I

1648
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,280
think I mean I think we agree with you I

1649
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:55,190
think hopefully no one up here feels

1650
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,540
like it's a death sentence but to the

1651
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:58,730
extent that people feel that way that's

1652
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:01,940
it that's a major issue it's it it's

1653
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:04,370
been an ongoing discussion in the IHG

1654
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:06,799
and and we would welcome the discussion

1655
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:08,090
with the community about it as well okay

1656
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,320
I'm gonna cut the mic line because we're

1657
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,870
supposed to stick to ten minutes and

1658
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:15,940
Kirsty you're next thank you

1659
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:17,050
Kirsty P NCSC so I just wanted to

1660
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,790
some of the comments that have been said

1661
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:21,310
about conduct it's been really good to

1662
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:23,949
see that being taken seriously at this

1663
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:26,260
IETF on meaningless as well I had a

1664
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:29,110
suggestion you did mention before and

1665
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:31,630
ways to prevent or you know tackle bad

1666
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:34,960
behavior and your idea here so I just

1667
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:38,650
wanted to pitch my idea which was to

1668
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:41,770
create an everyday sexism style but

1669
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:43,360
every day at IETF so for those who

1670
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:45,250
aren't aware of the everyday sexism

1671
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,530
project I recommend looking up on

1672
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:49,060
Twitter it's just where people can

1673
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:50,889
submit their experiences where they

1674
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:54,100
relate to sexism and harassment that

1675
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:57,010
they experience so I'm proposing just as

1676
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:58,750
an idea and every day I ETF not limited

1677
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:01,949
to the sexism and harassment you might

1678
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:04,540
experience but poor conduct and various

1679
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:07,509
difficult behaviors you might encounter

1680
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:09,190
and so I would just put that forward as

1681
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:12,820
an idea following the everyday sexism

1682
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:19,210
format that was it thank you thank you

1683
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:22,000
very much I Daniel can go more so I am

1684
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:24,910
very happy to hear that this community

1685
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,489
is starting to take our internal conduct

1686
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:29,739
more seriously we do a lot of work in

1687
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:31,809
the public and we are an extremely

1688
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:35,080
unrepresentative sample of the people

1689
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:37,300
who depend on our work and there are a

1690
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,210
lot of people who might be interested in

1691
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:42,100
being here who are turned off by all

1692
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:45,310
kinds of stuff that happens here

1693
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:47,410
probably just a technical jargon but the

1694
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:49,030
the aggressiveness that we sometimes

1695
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:51,849
treat each other even when we know each

1696
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:54,429
other well is really off-putting

1697
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:57,250
especially to some newcomers so I think

1698
01:18:54,430 --> 01:19:00,190
we would do well to take that seriously

1699
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:02,500
and think about the way that the conduct

1700
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:04,449
not only has an effect on those of us

1701
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:06,310
who are here and I'm sure we've all been

1702
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:07,480
burned by some of this conduct but I

1703
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:08,980
hope that we're thinking about the

1704
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,049
conduct in respect to the people who

1705
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:18,500
aren't here and whether we want more

1706
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:20,810
people to join us thank you Jenna Inger

1707
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,130
Martin and EKG have basically said

1708
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:23,420
everything you want to say but I'm gonna

1709
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:28,100
say it again because it's worth

1710
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:31,070
repeating I've been with this community

1711
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:33,050
for 19 years and I don't really pay

1712
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:36,259
attention or listen to the ietf mailing

1713
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:38,000
list I'm not saying this because I'm

1714
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:40,790
proud of it I'm saying this because I

1715
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,910
can't keep up with the what I see on the

1716
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:49,670
mailing list oftentimes separately I

1717
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:52,219
wanna applaud but I won't

1718
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,810
i I do want to say that this is what I

1719
01:19:52,219 --> 01:19:56,840
saw on the slides was very encouraging

1720
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:59,300
this is to me the leadership taking some

1721
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,070
some action on sort of figuring out how

1722
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:04,130
to deal with contact but what I saw the

1723
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:06,739
slides was more of a safeguard against

1724
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:09,260
unprofessional behavior actually making

1725
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:12,500
this place positive and encouraging for

1726
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:15,080
others to contribute in is something

1727
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:18,800
that the community each one of us has to

1728
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:21,170
do and to that extent the minimum that I

1729
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:24,469
can do is to make sure that if I see

1730
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:26,900
somebody being abrasive or continuously

1731
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:28,610
abrasive I will call it out I'll at

1732
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:37,759
least talk to them and I'll try to make

1733
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:41,480
sure that it's considered thank you Mark

1734
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:43,070
Nottingham I have a suggestion I don't

1735
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,830
know if it's a good one but I think it's

1736
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:48,530
worth thinking about and John referred

1737
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:49,219
earlier to the IETF main list it's a

1738
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:52,880
free-for-all

1739
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:55,010
I appreciate the focus on behavior that

1740
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,170
we're seeing this is really good but I

1741
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:58,810
can't help but wonder if it's really

1742
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:00,980
representative of community more

1743
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:02,570
anecdotally I hear of a lot of people

1744
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:05,389
who don't subscribe to it because they

1745
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:08,059
find it too gladiatorial toxic whatever

1746
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:09,620
word you want to use and as a result I

1747
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:12,590
wonder if we're getting good technical

1748
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:14,570
input there especially regarding IETF

1749
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:16,310
last calls that's one of the purposes of

1750
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:19,040
the list it's supposed to be the

1751
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:21,469
community's review of the technical work

1752
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,910
that's happening here so to me it seems

1753
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:25,940
like we should have a list that's

1754
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:28,160
dedicated to that purpose and more

1755
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,629
heavily moderated than the IETF main

1756
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,820
list

1757
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:33,490
so that the participants who can't put

1758
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:35,710
up with that level of whatever it is can

1759
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:37,599
still go and have a voice in last call

1760
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:39,040
discussions I know there are some

1761
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,300
downsides to that but I think it's

1762
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:50,200
something we should take seriously and

1763
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:52,540
consider I'll take the applause and lack

1764
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:55,510
of booze to support for what Mark said I

1765
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:57,580
support it also I think the discussions

1766
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,530
that happen on the IETF list are

1767
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:02,140
important discussions and while they may

1768
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:04,030
veer off into the weeds and particular

1769
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:07,180
discussions might be annoying on the

1770
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:10,030
whole we need it but I agree completely

1771
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:12,070
that we should make the I the last call

1772
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:14,980
comments and the threads that come out

1773
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:17,230
of that have their own home so I would

1774
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:20,830
like to support that I'd like the is G

1775
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:23,080
to do that seek some more feedback on

1776
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:24,760
that suggestion thank you and that

1777
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:27,160
brings us to the end of our 10 minutes

1778
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,460
so thank you is she and next we have the

1779
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,460
ivy

1780
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:37,290
[Applause]

1781
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:38,790
so the IV could go ahead and come up so

1782
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:41,850
that we don't have another shift after

1783
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:44,180
Olaf speaks that would be good thank you

1784
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:44,180
very much

1785
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:02,640
Cindy can I ask you a favor

1786
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:04,410
there's a monitor behind me that is

1787
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,450
producing some noise that's causing my

1788
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:07,950
hearing aids to go crazy if you can see

1789
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:09,389
if they can turn that down or off that

1790
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,099
would be very useful

1791

1799
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:52,080
Nottingham Bryan Dremel Colin Perkins

1800
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:53,849
had their flanagan and now I would like

1801
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:57,330
to introduce Olaf Copeland who will go

1802
01:23:53,850 --> 01:24:02,910
through a short review of the 66 35

1803
01:23:57,330 --> 01:24:06,000
structures and processes hello um so

1804
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:08,790
yeah my name is Olaf cold man I work for

1805
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,250
the Internet Society but I don't speak

1806
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:15,480
on their behalf and specifically look

1807
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:19,650
now I'm here as the forming a former

1808
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:23,129
acting RFC series editor and also as a

1809
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:26,429
co-editor of the current model DRC a

1810
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:30,630
data model version 2 there's something

1811
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:34,110
to unpack in here the fact that there is

1812
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:36,960
an acting RFC series editor or there has

1813
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:39,750
been an acting our C Series editor and

1814
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:44,220
that the RFC editor model is on version

1815
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:49,190
2 means that this is part of a longer

1816
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:52,560
conversation here's a first disclaimer I

1817
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:55,110
am NOT going to tell you the whole

1818
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:59,520
history and I'm not going to perform

1819
01:24:55,110 --> 01:25:02,599
exegesis on all these error sees the

1820
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,800
intent is to give you an idea of

1821
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,440
specifically the people who are new in

1822
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,950
this room and new to this conversation

1823
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:11,379
what we are talking about

1824
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:17,440
when we have the discussion at the mic

1825
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:19,630
lines in a few minutes from now so part

1826
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,519
of a longer conversation a conversation

1827
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:24,640
that started 50 years ago and it has

1828
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,370
gone through several iterations in

1829
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:30,580
trying to institutionalize it in a way

1830
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:36,099
that is suitable for the community the

1831
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:42,040
broader community this model are

1832
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:45,250
documented in RFC 66 35 has now been in

1833
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:51,460
operation for about seven years I

1834
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:55,390
believe the first ideas around this

1835
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:58,030
model are documented in RFC 4844 and it

1836
01:25:55,390 --> 01:26:01,750
basically describes what it is that an

1837
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:03,610
RFC editor is expected to do so what I'm

1838
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:07,800
telling you today is a bit of a

1839
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:10,799
combination between RFC 84 44 and RFC

1840
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,800
6655

1841
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:17,500
so when we talk about the RFC editor we

1842
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:19,960
talk about a function a function that

1843
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:23,860
used to be performed by one person but

1844
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:26,860
that has evolved and what the RC editor

1845
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:30,070
essentially does it takes raw input text

1846
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:32,500
in the form of internet drafts and it

1847
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:36,130
spits out RFC's that is the most

1848
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:39,430
simplistic way of thinking about the RFC

1849
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:42,940
era but of course there is structure to

1850
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:46,180
this first where does the income the

1851
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:50,710
input come from the input comes from you

1852
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:56,740
in the form of ITF documents as approved

1853
01:26:50,710 --> 01:27:00,700
by the IHT our RTF documents as approved

1854
01:26:56,740 --> 01:27:03,670
by the RRS IRS G the IAB documents as

1855
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:05,590
approved by the IAB and the independent

1856
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:10,810
documents as approved by the intimate

1857
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:12,910
independent submission editor the

1858
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:15,220
independent submission editor is a part

1859
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:17,380
of the RFC model that we are discussing

1860
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:20,350
but I'm going to shift that apart this

1861
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:22,219
is all input this is not part of the

1862
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:27,600
errors yet

1863
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:32,130
the RC editor simply or simply they sort

1864
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:34,739
of designed this like this and I realize

1865
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:37,590
I'm talking about boxes and about and

1866
01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:42,290
and and these boxes of course there are

1867
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:44,960
people behind this so apologies by

1868
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:50,160
putting it here like this

1869
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:52,890
first your internet drafts get into the

1870
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:57,239
system and there are copy edited by the

1871
01:27:52,890 --> 01:28:01,320
RFC production center the RC production

1872
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:03,839
center producing RC and gives that RFC

1873
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:08,370
to another entity which is the RFC

1874
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:11,670
publisher and they publish the RFC and

1875
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:13,950
archive it those two functions are

1876
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:16,950
currently operated by one contractor

1877
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:19,320
which is AMS and you all know sandy and

1878
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:21,870
Alice they are the people who for

1879
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:26,250
instance work in the RFC production

1880
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:30,260
center then there is the RC series

1881
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:34,350
editor the RFC series editor is the

1882
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:36,890
person that is has a number of functions

1883
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:40,260
with respect to the sort of long-term

1884
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:43,980
strategy and and the management of of

1885
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:46,020
the entity the responsibilities of the

1886
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:47,280
RFC series editor are strategic

1887
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:50,370
leadership and management of the

1888
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,429
publication and production functions so

1889
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:55,140
that is managerial oversight but also

1890
01:28:52,430 --> 01:29:00,060
strategic leadership thinking about how

1891
01:28:55,140 --> 01:29:02,850
this functions evolved representation of

1892
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:04,469
the RC series towards the ITF and others

1893
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:07,040
including the development of our

1894
01:29:04,469 --> 01:29:09,390
simulated policy in the wider context

1895
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,880
this is what have there has been doing

1896
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:15,239
and the report that you just saw was an

1897
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:17,640
aspect of that development of RC

1898
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:21,179
production and publication so how do we

1899
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:24,090
evolve how we produce our FCS and how do

1900
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:25,950
we publish them the errata for instance

1901
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:28,219
is an example of that and the

1902
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:30,980
development of the RFC series itself

1903
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:37,040
discussions about streams

1904
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:39,290
new types of content coming in many of

1905
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:42,680
these functions are ultimately overseen

1906
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:45,760
on behalf of the wider community by the

1907
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:48,890
IAB the IAB has a charge of

1908
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:51,140
responsibility in oversight of the RFC

1909
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:54,290
series and the way that that is

1910
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:58,640
implemented is that the RFC has created

1911
01:29:54,290 --> 01:30:00,950
a DB the the IAB has delegated a lot of

1912
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:05,180
the responsibility to the RFC series

1913
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:08,030
Oversight Committee this is sort of how

1914
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:12,620
the oversight and responsibilities are

1915
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:14,780
working so at a bottom you have the two

1916
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:16,730
should publish the production the

1917
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:21,429
publication function the contracts

1918
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:24,769
maintained the contractor is AMS and

1919
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:27,920
contracts in this diagram are all with

1920
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:30,350
the LLC that was of course the IOC when

1921
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,180
this RC was written so that's the orange

1922
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:35,600
lines or the lines that come from the

1923
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:38,030
right I'm not quite sure if orange and

1924
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:40,700
green is seen by everybody I just

1925
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:43,009
realize those are the lines coming down

1926
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:46,360
from the right those are contractual

1927
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:49,360
relationships those are budget oversight

1928
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,360
matters

1929
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:57,200
RFC 4844 speaks about administration on

1930
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:58,580
oversight by the RUC and policy

1931
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:03,260
oversight by the IAB

1932
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:07,010
and so the strategy and substance is

1933
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:09,290
overseen by the IAB but that is all in

1934
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:11,210
conversation of courses developed in

1935
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:14,480
conversation with the community at large

1936
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:16,760
and there is a book in this slide the

1937
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,160
community-at-large arrows go one way of

1938
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:22,610
course they should go two ways there is

1939
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:25,240
interaction that is supposed to be a

1940
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:25,240
conversation

1941
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:34,910
the are sock is a program or committee

1942
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:38,460
of the IAB the idea at the time was that

1943
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:41,429
the IB is a rotating body and

1944
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:44,190
in order to give longer-term and

1945
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:46,800
strategic guidance it is important to

1946
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:50,400
get people in there that have a lifespan

1947
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:54,090
that is longer than than the IAB itself

1948
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:58,429
and one has the ability to put people

1949
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:58,429
with specialized background on that

1950
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:08,489
excuse me yeah I'm surprised not to see

1951
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:10,320
the RFC series advisory group that was

1952
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:13,980
in my speaking notes and I was about to

1953
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:17,400
say the astute observer would say there

1954
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:20,459
is no our C Series advisory group that's

1955
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:23,099
simply because the the the model doesn't

1956
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:26,460
prescribe that group it is an advisory

1957
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:29,489
group that is acting on behalf of the

1958
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:32,969
RFC series editor to be asked off what

1959
01:32:29,489 --> 01:32:36,239
is the right wording here so if you hear

1960
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:38,310
about the R Seck the RFC series advisory

1961
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:41,459
group that would be a box that is

1962
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:46,380
hanging of the RFC series editor but

1963
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:48,989
really informs that function that is the

1964
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:51,480
oversight that I want to give I hope

1965
01:32:48,989 --> 01:32:52,919
that informs the discussion for the

1966
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:55,830
people who have never heard of these

1967
01:32:52,920 --> 01:33:00,239
these functions I'm not going to take

1968
01:32:55,830 --> 01:33:04,530
clarifying questions I'm going to get

1969
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:09,980
from say thank you very much Olaf for

1970
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:13,320
putting together this slide deck and

1971
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:15,839
giving this background as I said in my

1972
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:19,290
email earlier the IAB is primarily here

1973
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:21,390
to listen so please if you have advice

1974
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:21,989
for us at this point please get to the

1975
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:28,170
mic lines

1976
01:33:21,989 --> 01:33:31,110
Lucy Lucy I thank all off for this there

1977
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:33,300
are some places in the model and that I

1978
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:35,699
might argue with him a bit I actually

1979
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:38,550
think the RFC editor is a role not just

1980
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:43,199
a function I actually think the series

1981
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:46,950
in itself is a box along with the IAB

1982
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:52,500
and the isg I think it predates

1983
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:57,740
the idea so for me stewardship of the

1984
01:33:52,500 --> 01:34:00,090
the RFC series and protection of the

1985
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:03,630
independence and the integrity of the

1986
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:05,040
RFC editor as a role are extremely

1987
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:09,030
important so I have a couple of

1988
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:11,580
questions for you Ted speaking for the

1989
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:14,670
IAB what do you think the role of the

1990
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:18,360
series's what do you think the role of

1991
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:21,270
the RFC editor is and what is the

1992
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:24,630
responsibility of the IAB as stewards of

1993
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:28,260
that asset so I think one of the things

1994
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:30,840
that changed in the RFC editor model

1995
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:33,270
version 2 is that some of the things

1996
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:36,510
which had historically been associated

1997
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:38,430
with the single role were moved into

1998
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:40,200
multiple roles and one of the productive

1999
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:42,450
functions of the RFC editor has

2000
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:45,540
historically been to provide a mechanism

2001
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:47,490
to allow people who are not part of the

2002
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:50,400
ITF standards process or one of the

2003
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:51,900
other kind of common ways of producing

2004
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:55,500
documents of interest to the internet

2005
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:59,719
technical community to to publish and I

2006
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:02,640
think we took that aspect of the RFC

2007
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:05,010
editor historic function and it became

2008
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:07,800
the independent series editor which has

2009
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:09,990
its own editorial board and became one

2010
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,370
of the input streams so I think to some

2011
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:14,070
degree I certainly agree with you the

2012
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:18,390
RFC editor is itself a role but it's

2013
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:20,759
also a role that has been shared among

2014
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:22,950
multiple other roles in this current

2015
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:24,990
model now you asked me what I thought

2016
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:27,840
the role of the RSC editor is and and

2017
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:30,389
they the way I look at it from a

2018
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:32,340
metaphor perspective is sort of like a

2019
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:34,200
town planner if you think about what we

2020
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:39,480
do we're the construction workers we

2021
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:42,420
build the houses what the RFC production

2022
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:44,669
center does is they come through and

2023
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:47,430
make sure that everything in the houses

2024
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:50,520
is up to code and if necessary they help

2025
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:53,820
us bring it up to code if it isn't the

2026
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:57,060
role the RSC plays is more like a town

2027
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:59,759
planner she doesn't get into the details

2028
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:00,480
of whether any particular document is up

2029
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,710
to code

2030
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,809
helps make sure that the codes are

2031
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:07,110
modern and she helps make sure that the

2032
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:09,060
outputs from the city are well under

2033
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:11,610
well connected to the rest of the world

2034
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:14,820
that the roads coming in and out of the

2035
01:36:11,610 --> 01:36:18,120
city in this case the publication venues

2036
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:20,639
in which the RFC editor sorry the RFC

2037
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:24,420
publications are understood that all of

2038
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:28,350
those work well so from our perspective

2039
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:30,960
it's a very very important role and it's

2040
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:34,410
at a level that most of us don't operate

2041
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,820
on the day to day basis we're mostly the

2042
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:39,680
construction workers were writing a

2043
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:41,730
draft or mostly building the houses and

2044
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:46,710
interacting on a day to day basis for

2045
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:50,009
the code inspectors so as stewards of

2046
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:52,500
that function and you know as Brian

2047
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:53,940
carpenter is put this the kind of

2048
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:57,060
stewardship that's involved in that has

2049
01:36:53,940 --> 01:37:00,629
gone through multiple steps the main

2050
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:02,970
thing to that we have to do as stores is

2051
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:05,670
to make sure it keeps going we're not

2052
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:08,370
experts in town planning we're not

2053
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:11,280
experts in publication our job is to

2054
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:13,050
make sure that with the community and

2055
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,690
with the our sock that the function

2056
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:19,650
keeps going so that the individually

2057
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:22,650
built houses each draft remains part of

2058
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:26,420
a functioning whole the city or the

2059
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:26,420
series does that make sense

2060
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:36,139
it does make sense it also explains to

2061
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:41,790
me a little bit why you may have a more

2062
01:37:36,139 --> 01:37:45,050
limited view of the editorial capability

2063
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:47,310
that provides that integrity

2064
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:49,110
independence whatever that is needed

2065
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:51,630
speaking for the big I internet

2066
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:54,570
community not just the inside the box

2067
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:57,179
you know okay and I appreciate that I

2068
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:58,650
will say that it's never a good idea to

2069
01:37:57,179 --> 01:38:00,540
let the people who are building the

2070
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:02,580
houses to write the code there's always

2071
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:05,550
a risk there you do want independence

2072
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:08,219
and I recognize that so I think that the

2073
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:10,380
order was actually John was next and

2074
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:12,960
then up to the front microphone John

2075
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:27,050
nope the police way we ended up with the

2076
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:33,420
same question so John was excuse my

2077
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:35,250
deteriorating voice Ted I want to start

2078
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:38,219
with a brief observation about all's

2079
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,699
presentation which is that when the are

2080
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:41,489
socks

2081
01:38:38,699 --> 01:38:47,928
started and I was very much part of it

2082
01:38:41,489 --> 01:38:47,928
at the beginning it saw its role as

2083
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:55,679
assisting and aiding the RSC to perform

2084
01:38:52,889 --> 01:38:58,889
well and make and make certain of

2085
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:01,590
overall function works and at some stage

2086
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:04,469
that seems to have shifted into what's

2087
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:10,710
now seeing it as a oversight in the

2088
01:39:04,469 --> 01:39:12,659
management sense role and I don't know

2089
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:18,719
what started that shift or how we got

2090
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:21,409
there but I noticed that the the IAB has

2091
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:24,360
over the last several years completely

2092
01:39:21,409 --> 01:39:26,849
related the are sock and I'd like to

2093
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:30,389
better understand why that was done and

2094
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:32,219
how the mandate and your expectations of

2095
01:39:30,389 --> 01:39:35,159
the our sock in the RIC changed in the

2096
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:39,570
process thank you

2097
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:42,598
so the RFC 66 35 doesn't actually tell

2098
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:44,670
the IAB on what schedule

2099
01:39:42,599 --> 01:39:47,610
to repopulated or how to do it and so

2100
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:49,619
the IAB has done it on a periodic basis

2101
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:53,159
essentially in the past four or five

2102
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:55,348
years every two years and looked for new

2103
01:39:53,159 --> 01:39:58,829
volunteers or looked to refresh the

2104
01:39:55,349 --> 01:40:00,630
program the last time through we did a

2105
01:39:58,829 --> 01:40:03,540
standard program refresh which means

2106
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:05,429
that we called call for volunteers for

2107
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:07,710
the whole program got many volunteers

2108
01:40:05,429 --> 01:40:09,989
who'd already been on the arishok for

2109
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:13,619
some time and some new ones and then

2110
01:40:09,989 --> 01:40:17,489
asked for community commentary and then

2111
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:20,309
went through the the process of

2112
01:40:17,489 --> 01:40:23,459
selecting some and populating the new

2113
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:24,989
our Sauk as you notice that we've we've

2114
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,610
definitely heard from the community that

2115
01:40:24,989 --> 01:40:28,799
that might have been the wrong thing to

2116
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:30,929
do and we've proposed to the community

2117
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,659
that we switch that if there are not

2118
01:40:30,929 --> 01:40:36,480
more major changes to a rotating

2119
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:38,699
membership for three year fixed terms

2120
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,419
with renewal that makes sure that we

2121
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:46,650
never refresh all of the our suck again

2122
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:48,960
at any one time and I think that that is

2123
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:51,449
sort of a structural change that will

2124
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:54,090
help make sure that the lessons we learn

2125
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:56,129
from this aren't as easy to lose because

2126
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:59,460
I do think you're right one of the

2127
01:40:56,130 --> 01:41:02,400
things that happened here was the

2128
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:04,590
standard meaning of oversight more and

2129
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:08,579
more came into play in the understanding

2130
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:11,070
of what the the our Sauk was meant to be

2131
01:41:08,579 --> 01:41:13,710
doing and I think in particular it

2132
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:16,019
occurs when you're around these moments

2133
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:19,469
of contract and contract renewal and

2134
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:21,030
it's because in those cases it causes

2135
01:41:19,469 --> 01:41:24,030
people who have standard business

2136
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:26,009
arrangements to say hey I understand

2137
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:28,590
what oversight means when I'm making a

2138
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:32,969
contract or I understand what oversight

2139
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:36,360
means when I'm hiring a person that we

2140
01:41:32,969 --> 01:41:38,190
lost some of the the nuance that what

2141
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:40,409
oversight was meant to mean was

2142
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:43,829
something different here and I think

2143
01:41:40,409 --> 01:41:46,290
that what we're looking to figure out I

2144
01:41:43,829 --> 01:41:47,820
mean obviously this whole process has

2145
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:49,469
been a forceful reminder that the

2146
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:52,250
community has a different expectation

2147
01:41:49,469 --> 01:41:54,570
here how we make sure that this becomes

2148
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:55,669
reflected in the documents in a way that

2149
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:58,799
it's part of the structure

2150
01:41:55,669 --> 01:42:02,189
because it's it's pretty obvious we had

2151
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:05,789
people with five three two years of

2152
01:42:02,189 --> 01:42:07,979
experience on on the air sock but the

2153
01:42:05,789 --> 01:42:10,438
lure didn't get carried forward in the

2154
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:12,869
program enough I think it has to be in

2155
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:14,489
the documents in selves and I think

2156
01:42:12,869 --> 01:42:16,530
we've referred to that as kind of one of

2157
01:42:14,489 --> 01:42:18,898
the structural things that happened here

2158
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:21,179
where the way the document was written

2159
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:25,590
and what it talked about as oversight

2160
01:42:21,179 --> 01:42:27,959
had very basic hiring and firing kind of

2161
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:29,909
oversight in it and other things that

2162
01:42:27,959 --> 01:42:32,879
describe the role in different ways and

2163
01:42:29,909 --> 01:42:35,398
the tension between them has now been

2164
01:42:32,879 --> 01:42:39,539
manifested in this tension and we need

2165
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:42,419
to fix them in in addition to that and I

2166
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:44,879
will make this very brief hot there was

2167
01:42:42,419 --> 01:42:47,939
a shift from expecting there to be

2168
01:42:44,879 --> 01:42:51,329
serious publication strategy experts

2169
01:42:47,939 --> 01:42:54,749
ease on the are sock that got lost

2170
01:42:51,329 --> 01:42:56,639
somewhere in the process and that also

2171
01:42:54,749 --> 01:42:59,269
may be a matter of not having written

2172
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:01,649
things down enough it may be a matter of

2173
01:42:59,269 --> 01:43:04,649
not enough institutional memory on the

2174
01:43:01,649 --> 01:43:06,959
IAB but to the extent to which one wants

2175
01:43:04,649 --> 01:43:09,329
that historical quote oversight and

2176
01:43:06,959 --> 01:43:12,570
quote role that has to be expertise

2177
01:43:09,329 --> 01:43:14,249
there which is above and beyond very

2178
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:16,349
sincere members of the community want to

2179
01:43:14,249 --> 01:43:18,329
help with this thanks for the feedback

2180
01:43:16,349 --> 01:43:21,719
I appreciate Kathleen I think you're

2181
01:43:18,329 --> 01:43:24,629
next okay so my questions for a Ted and

2182
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:27,780
Alyssa and I'm gonna ask this multi-part

2183
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:30,360
question retrospectively but it's more

2184
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:33,119
with an eye towards how do we bake this

2185
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:35,280
into the process going forward and make

2186
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:36,598
sure that it's considered too because I

2187
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:39,719
think it will make a difference

2188
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:43,139
so was risk management considered in the

2189
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:45,510
decision process and by that I mean or

2190
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:49,709
the potential outcomes enumerated with

2191
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:52,070
the possible outcomes and I'm sorry

2192
01:43:49,709 --> 01:43:56,070
possible outcomes and potential business

2193
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:58,438
impact and remediation options as to

2194
01:43:56,070 --> 01:44:01,018
inform a business decision and I ask

2195
01:43:58,439 --> 01:44:02,309
this as I've been C so multiple times

2196
01:44:01,019 --> 01:44:06,059
right so I've had to go through this

2197
01:44:02,309 --> 01:44:08,520
type of process at every time some some

2198
01:44:06,059 --> 01:44:13,050
sort of large security decision was

2199
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:15,270
made and another part of that was the

2200
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:19,110
LLC consulted since they own the

2201
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:21,390
contract or the trust which Amon so I

2202
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:24,210
know we weren't but we own the published

2203
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:25,890
RFC's so so let me go backwards and that

2204
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:28,980
the way the process is currently

2205
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:31,830
structured the LLC part of the process

2206
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:35,099
had not started when this information

2207
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:37,320
came into the LLC and the IAB that the

2208
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:39,900
RC was not renewing our contract and so

2209
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:42,450
they were not for it before the

2210
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:44,790
recommendation letter went out like okay

2211
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:48,660
so I think having risk management

2212
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:50,970
started at that early phase could have

2213
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:55,019
helped but I am asking that to Ted and

2214
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:59,850
Alissa not to the our sock because I

2215
01:44:55,020 --> 01:45:02,550
view this as really a level above that

2216
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:05,810
in terms of where we're where are we

2217
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:08,640
placing risk management functions and

2218
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:10,140
having the process that goes up through

2219
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:12,600
the business to people who are

2220
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:18,000
responsible right to make those business

2221
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:19,770
decisions thank you for the comment I

2222
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,990
think I might need to follow up with you

2223
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:23,850
a little bit more offline about exactly

2224
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:25,260
how your modeling risk management

2225
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:28,230
because I think what you mean by it

2226
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:29,580
might not be quite what I understand it

2227
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:31,320
but given the mic lines if you don't

2228
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:33,090
mind I'd like to take the further detail

2229
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:34,410
and that's fine I've done quite a bit of

2230
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:36,900
work in this space so it's really just

2231
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:38,309
making sure it goes up to people in the

2232
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,839
business it looks like Melissa wants to

2233
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:44,570
respond as well so I'd appreciate that

2234
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,570
okay thank you sue you're next thank you

2235
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:51,420
I mean happy to have more follow-up on

2236
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:54,060
this but the one thing I would say at

2237
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:55,650
least my understanding of RFC 66 35 is

2238
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:58,020
like a very strong presumption of

2239
01:45:55,650 --> 01:46:00,269
delegation to the our sack for all of

2240
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:02,940
these matters and I think that was by

2241
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:05,490
design like why would you have two

2242
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:07,259
committees overseeing you know having

2243
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:09,120
any oversight role over a single

2244
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:11,550
individual if they weren't supposed to

2245
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:13,170
have functionally different roles so I

2246
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:15,810
think that's part of what gets to your

2247
01:46:13,170 --> 01:46:17,670
question is that there was a there's a

2248
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:19,650
strong level of independence and

2249
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:20,910
delegation between the IV and our psyche

2250
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:23,250
at least as I've under

2251
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:25,650
stood it okay the lawyer and the RFC

2252
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:28,140
thank you and I think it goes to some of

2253
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:30,299
the roll definition and assumptions and

2254
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:34,350
they seem to be a little bit different

2255
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:35,490
through the room so no you're next thank

2256
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:37,860
you very much

2257
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:40,740
this question is for Lissa as you go

2258
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:43,469
forward you've asked us to think about

2259
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:47,190
going forward I I'd like to see what

2260
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:49,350
your arc isn't going forward Alyssa we

2261
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:52,110
had a and I knew in a unique position

2262
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:54,540
since you sit both on the IC and IB and

2263
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:59,670
I'm sure Ted I'd love to hear this from

2264
01:46:54,540 --> 01:47:02,880
you but we had an RF C++ buff to work on

2265
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:06,780
our main output which is RFC's what was

2266
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:08,850
your conclusion from that bath and how

2267
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:11,849
did you come to it just if you'd share

2268
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:17,220
the reasoning it would help maybe tell

2269
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:18,930
us what you're thinking about sure I

2270
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:21,150
mean I think it was it was a bit more of

2271
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:24,330
an IB initiative than anything else but

2272
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:27,870
I think I think it was very clear

2273
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:30,090
feedback from the boss that the topics

2274
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:32,610
that were raised were squarely in the

2275
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:35,010
province of the RFC series editor and

2276
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:38,790
she agreed to take them on and work on

2277
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:40,710
them and I think that was I mean in the

2278
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:42,150
realm of you know clarity of result from

2279
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:44,220
above it's one of the clearest results

2280
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:46,379
I've seen so that was good outcome I

2281
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:48,060
think you know the bluff itself was

2282
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:50,460
extremely divisive and that's why I've

2283
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:53,820
you know talked about it as having been

2284
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:54,690
a mistake because I think it created you

2285
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:57,120
know a lot of strife that was

2286
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:59,639
unnecessary but in terms of like further

2287
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:03,059
follow up it's it's entirely in in the

2288
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:05,130
RFC series editors court so as we're

2289
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:07,800
transitioning that did you feel the

2290
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:12,180
directions that Heather outlined were

2291
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:14,490
the appropriate directions she outlined

2292
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:17,640
several things she thought next or even

2293
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:20,219
this time shout wind off 48 does that

2294
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:23,430
seem to be the same sort of thing you

2295
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:26,070
foresee for the future I don't think the

2296
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:28,620
off 48 topic was really related to the

2297
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:31,799
Boff no it wasn't I was just giving it

2298
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:33,599
as an example that you might elucidate

2299
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,910
what things you felt

2300
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:41,730
and the buff would be good going forward

2301
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:43,230
what positive things yeah so so I don't

2302
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:46,349
think the odd 48 topic was related to

2303
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:50,700
the Boff but I will say that as far back

2304
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:53,040
as your and a half ago Heather and I

2305
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:56,099
were talking about the the RPC

2306
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:58,920
performance evaluation and this was the

2307
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:01,680
main topic that that came up that it

2308
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:05,760
would be great to get going on revisions

2309
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:09,270
Tara all 48 and you know I knew that it

2310
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:11,730
was sort of as the next project after

2311
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:13,470
the the format transition so from my

2312
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:16,230
personal individual perspective I think

2313
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:19,080
that's that seems like a fantastic next

2314
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:20,730
project but it's not really I mean my

2315
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,110
opinion isn't really the one that

2316
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:24,030
matters it kind of depends on the

2317
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:25,830
community and you know what the

2318
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:28,110
population of people who are working in

2319
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:30,330
the IETF stream want so I'll be

2320
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:32,400
interested to see if it does objective

2321
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:34,350
interest to other people those sound a

2322
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:38,040
bit tactical I was hoping for a

2323
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:40,800
strategic comic but thank you I'm sure

2324
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:43,740
maybe you give us some strategic forward

2325
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:47,840
how we make the stream more effective

2326
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:50,280
more than just the processing through

2327
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,890
yeah the strategy for the RFC series is

2328
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:58,259
not my responsibility so okay so I think

2329
01:49:52,890 --> 01:50:00,600
Tony is next no I'm not sure is next

2330
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:04,980
maybe it's me all right hey if you want

2331
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:08,580
something or somebody else know it's you

2332
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:12,030
I'll go so earlier today Sarah sent out

2333
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:13,680
an email to the ITF list with an apology

2334
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:15,030
from the or sake and I just want to say

2335
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:17,670
to you that I think that was a standard

2336
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:20,969
thing to do and thank you for it I think

2337
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:23,280
it sets a very good example there was a

2338
01:50:20,970 --> 01:50:25,110
couple of things in that email that

2339
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:29,429
caught my eye and one of them was talk

2340
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:32,580
about how the current situation came to

2341
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:35,660
be as a result of wanting to test out an

2342
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:38,490
RFC process because there was some

2343
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:40,740
uncertainty around sort of the earlier

2344
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:43,130
application of it and as somebody who's

2345
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:44,820
so does this for a living

2346
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:46,949
managing

2347
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:49,230
of peace as a large part of my day job

2348
01:50:46,949 --> 01:50:52,980
you know there is no such thing as to

2349
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:55,079
test the north RFP process you will run

2350
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:59,780
it or you don't

2351
01:50:55,079 --> 01:51:02,429
and in the kind of contracts that the

2352
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:05,219
various parts of the organization

2353
01:51:02,429 --> 01:51:09,000
manages all none of them as far as I can

2354
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:11,280
see or for no square meter of something

2355
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,530
a standard service it's all

2356
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:16,230
special-purpose it's all you know one

2357
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:18,269
offs in various forms and shapes and you

2358
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:20,459
have to be very much more careful when

2359
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:23,250
you managed and by those kinds of

2360
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:26,040
services so what I'm here to ask is are

2361
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:29,460
there anything is there anything else on

2362
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:31,440
the table so you know that we should be

2363
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:34,380
worried about you know are we gonna be

2364
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:37,440
here in Singapore or in Vancouver

2365
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:39,270
looking at other breakage because there

2366
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,848
are other people in the community who

2367
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:45,770
are affected by contracts the NOC

2368
01:51:41,849 --> 01:51:48,780
peopletools team not all of them are

2369
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:50,670
reimbursed directly or contracted but a

2370
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:54,119
lot of them are affected by contracts

2371
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:55,860
that the current ITF leadership is

2372
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:58,139
negotiating in various sort of

2373
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:00,150
concentrations I also will make sure

2374
01:51:58,139 --> 01:52:04,219
that we learn from this not only in the

2375
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:07,949
RFC future RFC process or the future

2376
01:52:04,219 --> 01:52:12,540
hiring of this particular function but

2377
01:52:07,949 --> 01:52:15,239
in other parts of the organization so we

2378
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:16,949
don't break anything else thank you for

2379
01:52:15,239 --> 01:52:20,159
your comment and I think the good news

2380
01:52:16,949 --> 01:52:21,780
is that none of the other contracts are

2381
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:26,659
held in quite this way where there's

2382
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:30,900
this recommendation appointment and then

2383
01:52:26,659 --> 01:52:32,610
referral to the to the LLC I think there

2384
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:35,519
are mostly a good bit simpler than this

2385
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:37,559
but I'm sure that the LSE board members

2386
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,020
here who who are listening are listening

2387
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:42,570
to the point you've made and we'll try

2388
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:44,340
and avoid making this right because

2389
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:46,799
there were a couple of Sarah actually

2390
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:50,460
had a couple of points in her email one

2391
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:52,710
of them was you know we we're looking at

2392
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:55,210
a an RFC where we don't understand

2393
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:58,570
what's going on we need to test it and

2394
01:52:55,210 --> 01:53:00,730
P and that's a Freudian slip

2395
01:52:58,570 --> 01:53:03,130
we're looking at an RFC we don't know

2396
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:05,049
why we then go as to expect that last

2397
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:07,840
time we're gonna test it I think that's

2398
01:53:05,050 --> 01:53:09,460
your number one mistake right

2399
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:12,910
the number two mistake of course is not

2400
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:14,440
communicating properly right and I'm not

2401
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:16,450
actually directing this as Sarah of

2402
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:20,049
course I'm directing it at the entire I

2403
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:21,969
start internship so what my ITF LLC had

2404
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:23,380
on lesson I learned was to call your

2405
01:53:21,969 --> 01:53:25,630
contractors and thank them and make sure

2406
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:28,210
this yeah that's that's part of it I

2407
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:29,980
mean I might so I did do that and my

2408
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:34,270
final point I've done the same thing

2409
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:36,730
with vendors that I manage I you know

2410
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:38,469
know to extend their contract when I had

2411
01:53:36,730 --> 01:53:41,468
the option I've never done that when I

2412
01:53:38,469 --> 01:53:46,270
was in was happy with the vendor never

2413
01:53:41,469 --> 01:53:48,070
ever we hear you and we I think you've

2414
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:50,860
seen from Sarah and from the arishok

2415
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:54,639
that that wasn't the intent and we

2416
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:58,530
apologize sorry I going to the back Mike

2417
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:02,350
is that Ron yeah that's wrong sorry sir

2418
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:05,009
okay then then Mike and then Ron sorry

2419
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:07,780
[Music]

2420
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:10,450
Mike you need to get a little bit closer

2421
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:12,400
I've been trying okay that close I've

2422
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:13,840
been trying to get a Mike st. John's

2423
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:15,759
I've been trying to get an idea the

2424
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,580
timeline here and we've been working our

2425
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:20,980
way back through all this stuff could

2426
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:24,130
the IAB members of the are sock

2427
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:27,190
identifying themselves please okay cool

2428
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:31,870
so I went back and to look at the IRA

2429
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:34,360
see our sock maintenance and there were

2430
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:38,349
only two discussions on this particular

2431
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:41,110
topic one of them was that because the I

2432
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:44,080
sock HR person back in 2005 had said you

2433
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:45,730
may not evaluate the contractor you

2434
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:48,030
would come up with a you must develop

2435
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:51,700
you're going to evaluate the contract

2436
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:54,519
but someplace in the middle of this you

2437
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:57,309
basically went off and and and decided

2438
01:54:54,520 --> 01:55:01,210
that the evaluation the contract was

2439
01:54:57,310 --> 01:55:03,700
also to do a rebid so who in this

2440
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:06,790
process was the prime mover for the

2441
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:09,070
rebid and what discussions were done

2442
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:12,250
besides it looks like the last me

2443
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:15,670
maybe two meetings prior and that topic

2444
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:17,199
was just the evaluation criteria nurse I

2445
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:19,360
can tell just because it was listed as

2446
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:21,339
executive session so let me let me

2447
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,750
caution you about something related to

2448
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:24,130
the executive session in addition of

2449
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:26,980
course to the executive session there

2450
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:28,449
it's an executive equivalent mailing

2451
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:29,739
list so you're probably not seeing the

2452
01:55:28,449 --> 01:55:31,719
full record because some of it may have

2453
01:55:29,739 --> 01:55:34,598
been since it is a personnel or a

2454
01:55:31,719 --> 01:55:37,150
contract matter on on this so please

2455
01:55:34,599 --> 01:55:38,710
understand that because we have to treat

2456
01:55:37,150 --> 01:55:41,469
these as confidential even when the

2457
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:43,389
intent is to be laudatory toward the

2458
01:55:41,469 --> 01:55:46,480
person some of this is not in the public

2459
01:55:43,389 --> 01:55:48,340
record and can't be put there now going

2460
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:54,940
back to the timeline question Christian

2461
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:56,590
you want to take that that was

2462
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:59,290
determines what you said it was

2463
01:55:56,590 --> 01:56:01,900
discussed in the last three months about

2464
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:04,179
no more and it was discussed at one

2465
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:07,170
meeting and you came up with the

2466
01:56:04,179 --> 01:56:11,260
decision to do the rebid in one meeting

2467
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:13,869
we had discussion before and we were

2468
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:18,400
really concerned that the earth is only

2469
01:56:13,869 --> 01:56:20,469
produced one bead that was a year and a

2470
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,980
half prior when did that discussion

2471
01:56:20,469 --> 01:56:24,989
happen

2472
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:24,989
no those discussions happening in Maine

2473
01:56:26,099 --> 01:56:30,429
okay so could I ask you to clarify why

2474
01:56:28,869 --> 01:56:32,889
you think that timeline is particularly

2475
01:56:30,429 --> 01:56:35,619
the primary issue here I'm trying to

2476
01:56:32,889 --> 01:56:39,099
figure out how much thought went into

2477
01:56:35,619 --> 01:56:42,549
this process of deciding to do this and

2478
01:56:39,099 --> 01:56:47,829
I'm I'm trying to make sure it we we

2479
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:51,730
don't end up with a oh let's just do the

2480
01:56:47,829 --> 01:56:53,290
RFP without you know just somebody

2481
01:56:51,730 --> 01:56:56,290
randomly deciding to do this so I need

2482
01:56:53,290 --> 01:57:02,619
to understand was there any discussion

2483
01:56:56,290 --> 01:57:04,150
of this and the impact of the rebid and

2484
01:57:02,619 --> 01:57:06,940
I'm not seeing that and they're in the

2485
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:08,888
record so and I think what you normally

2486
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:10,360
see in this case is the output and I

2487
01:57:08,889 --> 01:57:13,119
think I've talked to you about this on

2488
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:14,829
mailing list I'll repeat it here because

2489
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:17,110
this is something where it relates to a

2490
01:57:14,829 --> 01:57:18,780
contract or in in similar cases with

2491
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:21,210
personnel matters

2492
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:23,490
you normally judge these bye-bye output

2493
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:25,620
not by rehearsing the discussion in

2494
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:28,530
public and in this case the output was a

2495
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:30,360
recommendation for renewal now this was

2496
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:34,380
a consensus recommendation from the

2497
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:37,200
entire bargain in addition to that

2498
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:39,570
recommendation for renewal they brought

2499
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:41,550
back up an issue that had occurred in

2500
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:45,200
including in discussions from Heather

2501
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:47,820
that the last time that they had sought

2502
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:55,190
candidates they'd received only one and

2503
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:58,019
at the same time decided to make a a

2504
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:59,339
concerted effort over the following two

2505
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:01,320
years to figure out what had happened

2506
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:03,840
and see if they could issue another RFP

2507
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:06,570
now we've we've noted in the previous

2508
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:09,330
things here that was certainly a mistake

2509
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:10,769
in communication in communicating those

2510
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:13,920
at the same time because completely

2511
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:16,500
misunderstood as something that was

2512
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:18,900
reflective of Heather's performance

2513
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:21,260
despite it having caveats about that in

2514
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:23,309
it that's that's a mistake and it was I

2515
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:25,950
think sarah has been very clear about

2516
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:29,700
that it was also something where I think

2517
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:31,620
in response to leave we we certainly

2518
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:35,880
agreed that that's not how this should

2519
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:37,890
have gone that instead we understand

2520
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:41,040
that what we should have done here and

2521
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:43,700
this is a broad we is make sure that

2522
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:46,590
everybody was on board with that process

2523
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:47,970
including Heather before making the

2524
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:51,030
decision to do the reason perhaps

2525
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:53,010
including the community including the

2526
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:55,019
community as well but at that point in

2527
01:58:53,010 --> 01:58:55,920
the process the only part that had

2528
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:58,650
happened was the our stock

2529
01:58:55,920 --> 01:59:01,080
recommendation and then the RSC's

2530
01:58:58,650 --> 01:59:02,730
resignation so some bits of this that

2531
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:04,350
might have corrected this and it would

2532
01:59:02,730 --> 01:59:06,120
be kind of fanciful to assume that we

2533
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:08,190
actually got this right

2534
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:11,280
didn't happen and that's where it went

2535
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:13,650
wrong and did the IAB at that time reach

2536
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:17,240
out to Heather to request to reconsider

2537
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:20,940
well this was still private so the

2538
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:22,800
information came to the IAB I mean

2539
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:25,110
pretty much at exactly the same time

2540
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:28,070
that she told the LLC board

2541
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:30,829
Sarah did reach out to her right away I

2542
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:32,839
sent her an email personally but

2543
01:59:30,829 --> 01:59:35,119
list saying thank you for your service

2544
01:59:32,839 --> 01:59:37,339
and intended to reach out to her after I

2545
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:39,320
got back from the dead or workshop to

2546
01:59:37,339 --> 01:59:40,909
discuss further but because it was a you

2547
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:42,739
know literally in Helsinki on a plane

2548
01:59:40,909 --> 01:59:45,049
getting on a plane I couldn't get more

2549
01:59:42,739 --> 01:59:46,909
than that but you know it is definitely

2550
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:48,829
the case that we have heard that this

2551
01:59:46,909 --> 01:59:50,478
did not go right and we will see what we

2552
01:59:48,829 --> 01:59:52,849
can do to make sure that it is

2553
01:59:50,479 --> 02:00:00,169
structurally prevented from failing in

2554
01:59:52,849 --> 02:00:02,419
this way again run three comments first

2555
02:00:00,169 --> 02:00:04,639
thanks to Olaf for his slides they make

2556
02:00:02,419 --> 02:00:06,800
a very complicated process look really

2557
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:10,639
easy and it looks like a process that

2558
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:12,649
should run the second is I don't think

2559
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:16,429
we're quite ready to put out an RFP yet

2560
02:00:12,649 --> 02:00:19,309
and the reason why this process looks

2561
02:00:16,429 --> 02:00:24,019
like it should run well it didn't it

2562
02:00:19,309 --> 02:00:25,879
failed in a spectacular way the people

2563
02:00:24,019 --> 02:00:28,309
standing around the microphone are

2564
02:00:25,879 --> 02:00:32,358
trying to debug the process now what

2565
02:00:28,309 --> 02:00:34,519
happened what went wrong probably the

2566
02:00:32,359 --> 02:00:37,849
people who can debug the process best

2567
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:40,189
are the ones who executed it they should

2568
02:00:37,849 --> 02:00:42,829
probably do a post-mortem figure out

2569
02:00:40,189 --> 02:00:45,320
what went wrong who made the mistakes be

2570
02:00:42,829 --> 02:00:49,009
honest about it we learn from our

2571
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:53,329
mistakes the next thing is and we undo

2572
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:57,289
the damage is it possible if not can we

2573
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:59,629
at least admit to the mistakes and not

2574
02:00:57,289 --> 02:01:02,389
repeat them once we understand where the

2575
02:00:59,629 --> 02:01:03,379
process went wrong we can make sure we

2576
02:01:02,389 --> 02:01:05,780
don't do it again

2577
02:01:03,379 --> 02:01:09,649
but we shouldn't leap into the process

2578
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:13,608
again until we understand why the router

2579
02:01:09,649 --> 02:01:17,030
crashed thank you for the feedback

2580
02:01:13,609 --> 02:01:18,919
hi I'm gonna apologize for this I kind

2581
02:01:17,030 --> 02:01:20,329
of wasn't tracking who was at which

2582
02:01:18,919 --> 02:01:22,699
microphone at what time so I'm just

2583
02:01:20,329 --> 02:01:24,049
gonna call them serially Patrick you're

2584
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:26,719
next and then it will be Bob

2585
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:28,939
thanks Ted I'm going to try and be

2586
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:29,749
responsive to the question of where do

2587
02:01:28,939 --> 02:01:31,099
we go from here

2588
02:01:29,749 --> 02:01:35,590
all right and provide some input into

2589
02:01:31,099 --> 02:01:37,880
that I think the core issue of

2590
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:43,159
of what we have to deal with right now

2591
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:45,760
is a result of asking the RSC to

2592
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:48,348
simultaneously deal with these issues of

2593
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:50,179
strategy and administration and it's not

2594
02:01:48,349 --> 02:01:53,420
surprising when you think about what the

2595
02:01:50,179 --> 02:01:55,309
core work product of the IETF is and how

2596
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:59,900
leadership is responsible for greasing

2597
02:01:55,309 --> 02:02:02,329
the wheels to make that happen that the

2598
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:04,460
RSC is the Nexus of a lot of discussions

2599
02:02:02,329 --> 02:02:06,889
about not only the strategic evolution

2600
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:08,900
of the series but also you know the SLA

2601
02:02:06,889 --> 02:02:11,090
s that may be behind the format that

2602
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:14,089
everyone wants yesterday yada-yada-yada

2603
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:16,039
n FEI star was not responsive to that I

2604
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:17,750
would be if they mike saying hey what

2605
02:02:16,039 --> 02:02:21,230
about the SLA is right because that's

2606
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:24,170
what I need is output from my work when

2607
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:27,980
I when I come here so that creates this

2608
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:29,809
inherent tension and we should deal with

2609
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:31,129
that rather than putting a new person

2610
02:02:29,809 --> 02:02:34,420
immediately in a place where the same

2611
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:36,530
tension exists and I think the strategic

2612
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:38,869
are I'm sorry I think the more

2613
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:41,268
operational parts of RSA have you know

2614
02:02:38,869 --> 02:02:42,829
in many ways been moved out to the

2615
02:02:41,269 --> 02:02:45,139
production centre and the publisher has

2616
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:46,579
up here in the slides forgive my

2617
02:02:45,139 --> 02:02:51,949
hesitations talking here the feedback

2618
02:02:46,579 --> 02:02:53,630
here is amazing at this microphone does

2619
02:02:51,949 --> 02:02:55,820
the operational course that have largely

2620
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:58,130
been moved out and I think you know the

2621
02:02:55,820 --> 02:03:00,469
RFC's will continue to flow should this

2622
02:02:58,130 --> 02:03:03,170
position be vacant for you know a period

2623
02:03:00,469 --> 02:03:05,989
a short period of time while we deal

2624
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:08,869
with the harder strategic questions and

2625
02:03:05,989 --> 02:03:10,669
then once you if you manage to separate

2626
02:03:08,869 --> 02:03:14,570
those roles you can ask the question and

2627
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:16,400
I've heard wildly divergent opinions on

2628
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:18,139
how you structure someone that is only

2629
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,449
dealing with strategic questions there

2630
02:03:18,139 --> 02:03:21,800
right have we now created a leadership

2631
02:03:20,449 --> 02:03:24,650
position that looks a lot like the other

2632
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:27,619
leadership positions we have and so this

2633
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:28,879
shouldn't be you know a hired or a

2634
02:03:27,619 --> 02:03:30,679
contracted position there should be an

2635
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,909
appointed position you know and then you

2636
02:03:30,679 --> 02:03:33,860
would have more of a peer kind of

2637
02:03:31,909 --> 02:03:35,900
relationship and as soon as you create

2638
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:37,369
that other model you necessarily bring

2639
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:39,199
management into that and is that

2640
02:03:37,369 --> 02:03:40,219
attention that's not survivable can you

2641
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:42,678
carve off enough of that

2642
02:03:40,219 --> 02:03:45,019
so that's leadership more consistent

2643
02:03:42,679 --> 02:03:46,309
with the model we already do I'm not

2644
02:03:45,019 --> 02:03:47,389
asking you to solve that tonight but I'm

2645
02:03:46,309 --> 02:03:48,840
saying like those are the questions I

2646
02:03:47,389 --> 02:03:51,119
would like to see solved

2647
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:54,599
before we jump in with a new you know

2648
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:57,839
long-term relationship thank you for the

2649
02:03:54,599 --> 02:04:00,210
feedback Bob so

2650
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:03,860
regrettably I was standing at the mic

2651
02:04:00,210 --> 02:04:06,659
the last time we were here in this hotel

2652
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:10,079
talking about what happened at the at

2653
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:13,379
the RFC plus Bob and it's only gotten

2654
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:16,679
worse I mean this is this mean you're

2655
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:20,520
the management of this oversight and

2656
02:04:16,679 --> 02:04:23,130
this has been a giant failure I you know

2657
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:25,110
Oh of all his presentation was quite

2658
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:27,420
good and you know he said something very

2659
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:29,759
important he said the are sock was

2660
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:32,880
supposed to be the people with the long

2661
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:35,579
term history in this so things didn't

2662
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:37,710
change very quickly I mean that's that

2663
02:04:35,579 --> 02:04:41,159
was the intent and setting this up and

2664
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:42,599
when you when the IAB decided to cycle a

2665
02:04:41,159 --> 02:04:45,348
whole bunch of people in the are sock

2666
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:49,500
you lost all of that and that's I think

2667
02:04:45,349 --> 02:04:52,949
what led to the events that caused us to

2668
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:56,159
lose a really good person who you know

2669
02:04:52,949 --> 02:04:58,558
to lose Heather you it was a series of

2670
02:04:56,159 --> 02:05:02,190
errors that you know come back to a

2671
02:04:58,559 --> 02:05:04,409
bunch of things the IB did so where I'm

2672
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:06,690
going with this is I have no confidence

2673
02:05:04,409 --> 02:05:10,980
that the current our sock and the

2674
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:14,848
current IB are going to bring us run the

2675
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:16,919
process to get us the next RFC editor in

2676
02:05:14,849 --> 02:05:18,989
the way we want I think there's gonna

2677
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:21,630
have to be some significant changes in

2678
02:05:18,989 --> 02:05:23,250
this to get the right set of people

2679
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:26,969
involved in this so we get a good

2680
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:29,099
outcome thanks for your comments a

2681
02:05:26,969 --> 02:05:31,880
couple of clarifying comments for me and

2682
02:05:29,099 --> 02:05:34,650
then just to move on to the next person

2683
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:36,300
the way the IB program structures are

2684
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:38,460
worked not just for our sock which is

2685
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:41,550
one of the oldest and best described but

2686
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:44,130
all of them isn't to try and keep the

2687
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:47,579
history in the people in the program but

2688
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:49,639
to keep the history in the structure of

2689
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:52,619
the program the idea is that by creating

2690
02:05:49,639 --> 02:05:56,989
the structured program that lasts longer

2691
02:05:52,619 --> 02:05:59,880
than any IAB two-year term that the

2692
02:05:56,989 --> 02:06:01,809
there are always enough people in it who

2693
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:05,050
have been in it long enough

2694
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:07,900
that the the structures of the program

2695
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:10,300
keep things going in this case the IB

2696
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:13,000
did to a refresh that called for new

2697
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:14,380
people but it actually kept three people

2698
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,940
with a total of eleven years of

2699
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:22,350
experience in the our sock so I think

2700
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:26,769
it's important to note that they weren't

2701
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:28,240
either going and using this in a way

2702
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:29,770
where we were not going and using this

2703
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:34,090
in a way that's different from the other

2704
02:06:29,770 --> 02:06:37,390
IAB structures or that the the people

2705
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:38,710
who stayed in the our sock hadn't been

2706
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:40,840
there some significant period of time

2707
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:43,180
what I do think is a very important

2708
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:44,710
strategic question and I certainly agree

2709
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:46,360
with you that we should deal with is

2710
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:48,940
whether this is still the right

2711
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:52,059
structure it may very well be that

2712
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:54,730
having an R sock that is directly

2713
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:58,000
appointed by the NomCom or from some

2714
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:59,650
other mechanism that's tied to the the

2715
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,950
stream managers or some other thing may

2716
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:04,660
be a better solution now I think the

2717
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:07,870
most important thing that we can do from

2718
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:12,809
this point though is to figure out how

2719
02:07:07,870 --> 02:07:17,050
we get to that strategy and if it is not

2720
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:19,630
run the the RFP process and hire

2721
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:21,310
somebody to help us then we have to

2722
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:23,260
understand it will take some time for

2723
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:28,770
the community to come to consensus on

2724
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:28,770
what the new strategy ought to be Eric

2725
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:37,150
I'm just gonna do the oh yeah sorry I

2726
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:38,890
have a few notes so um I was interested

2727
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:41,410
to hear the discussion of what people's

2728
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:43,240
conceptions of sixty sixty five arms

2729
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:45,760
intention for the are sock war I went

2730
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:47,019
back and reviewed the material as I

2731
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,860
assume that the documents actually

2732
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:50,860
document what they're supposed to

2733
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:52,509
document so I mean this seems like a

2734
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:54,759
pretty classic oversight function to me

2735
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:56,320
has like due diligence and your view

2736
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:58,450
candidate selection all those things

2737
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:59,830
it's like if someone gave me like the

2738
02:07:58,450 --> 02:08:01,870
definition of oversight that's what I'd

2739
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:03,250
expect and it's and so it's what I

2740
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:04,900
expect the IAB to do for the RFC

2741
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:06,250
function and it's what I expect that

2742
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:07,750
given they've chosen to delegate that to

2743
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:09,850
our soccer are the community's chose to

2744
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:11,050
delegate that to our sake and with IB

2745
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:13,630
every seeing them that's what I suspect

2746
02:08:11,050 --> 02:08:14,810
our sock to do so and I certainly think

2747
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:16,460
the IB she responsible

2748
02:08:14,810 --> 02:08:18,500
community for their ultimate decisions

2749
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:19,910
but I certainly would not be happy if

2750
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:21,560
what that you know the output of this

2751
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:23,630
was that the our stock in the IB

2752
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,440
every time they made a decision had to

2753
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:25,670
like about of the community or

2754
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:26,929
validation of every individual decision

2755
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:28,490
that seems non-functional on the

2756
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:30,290
structure we have in this community is

2757
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:32,120
we trust the leadership to do things and

2758
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:33,500
we don't when they don't do them we have

2759
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:35,330
start first removing them in various

2760
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:38,780
ways we don't assume that they're double

2761
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:40,460
check everything with the community so

2762
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:41,960
do you speak a little bit slower oh I'm

2763
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:48,140
sorry yes I thought we were running out

2764
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:50,270
of time we we are running tight on time

2765
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:53,750
but we are also trying to listen I'm

2766
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:58,820
sorry sure should I start from the

2767
02:08:53,750 --> 02:09:01,700
beginning okay second thing I want to

2768
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:03,650
say is I want to district thank you for

2769
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:04,849
you to say that earlier about the sort

2770
02:09:03,650 --> 02:09:07,099
of the structures that we use for

2771
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:09,290
continuity it's really not a viable

2772
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:10,790
system to assume that continuity has to

2773
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:11,840
reside in like a few individuals who

2774
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:15,620
then carry on forever

2775
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:17,090
um Elliott doesn't work and I'm me this

2776
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:18,019
was taken the ITF over and over again we

2777
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:19,700
like think that like weights of it

2778
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:21,710
exactly right person in and like and

2779
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:24,050
like the way one builds like a viable

2780
02:09:21,710 --> 02:09:26,540
long-term system is by having structures

2781
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:28,640
not by having the great man or great

2782
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:29,960
woman theory of history this is been my

2783
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:32,180
experience and the companies I've worked

2784
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:35,960
in that doesn't really survive of all

2785
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:38,180
those people leave finally um I think it

2786
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:40,430
is clear from this interaction that the

2787
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:42,890
structure and the sort of grand strategy

2788
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:44,570
of what the RFC system then those boxes

2789
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:47,330
on the screen perhaps and maybe some

2790
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:49,549
rethink um I was heartened to hear

2791
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:50,840
Patrick um say that you know that if we

2792
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:52,610
don't solve this problem right away the

2793
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:54,560
aura seas will continue to flow and I

2794
02:09:52,610 --> 02:09:59,000
grew that I mean that's what we're here

2795
02:09:54,560 --> 02:10:01,820
so long the RO seas must flow so yeah I

2796
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,070
thought you'd like that so so I think

2797
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:09,110
certainly that gives us some time it's

2798
02:10:04,070 --> 02:10:10,730
not like an emergency the so I think you

2799
02:10:09,110 --> 02:10:11,389
know we have a broad scale we have sort

2800
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:13,070
of two options

2801
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:15,080
um one I think the one that Ron just

2802
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:16,700
indicated which is take a pause and

2803
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:18,170
don't appoint anybody new for a little

2804
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:19,849
while and sort of try to sort out and

2805
02:10:18,170 --> 02:10:22,640
community with the RFC whether it's our

2806
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:25,190
Shore to be and the second is on you

2807
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:26,630
know to appoint somebody for a shorter

2808
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:28,139
term perhaps you can help us sort out

2809
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:30,660
what that ought to be

2810
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:31,860
when the RC processes indicated 6055 to

2811
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:33,150
pick that person but with the

2812
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:34,710
expectation that we're gonna sort things

2813
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:35,969
out rather than that like that they're

2814
02:10:34,710 --> 02:10:37,830
fitting into some long-term final

2815
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:40,920
structure I think either those would be

2816
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:42,750
viable um but I think clearly whatever

2817
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:43,800
it is like we do you know ask the

2818
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:46,410
question is this the right strategy and

2819
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:47,610
truckster going forward thank you thank

2820
02:10:46,410 --> 02:10:51,480
you I understand Heather would like to

2821
02:10:47,610 --> 02:10:55,440
say something so with regards to RFC's

2822
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:58,530
flowing absolutely a priority there

2823
02:10:55,440 --> 02:11:00,299
we'll so yes I have a very tactical role

2824
02:10:58,530 --> 02:11:03,360
and the RSC else is a very strategic

2825
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:06,360
role the tactical role is an immediate

2826
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:07,580
need that you need to consider we we've

2827
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:10,049
been talking about the format change

2828
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:11,790
there's going to be day-to-day questions

2829
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:14,970
about how do we handle different things

2830
02:11:11,790 --> 02:11:18,180
that will need to be answered ongoing

2831
02:11:14,970 --> 02:11:23,610
and fairly quickly we've already added a

2832
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:25,470
new state in the database so that we can

2833
02:11:23,610 --> 02:11:27,690
track you know as we track at at time we

2834
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:30,270
tracked RFC editor time we tracked off

2835
02:11:27,690 --> 02:11:32,639
48 time and now we're gonna track tools

2836
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:34,140
time where something is stuck in a state

2837
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:38,400
where the tools aren't quite right that

2838
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:39,960
they need to change regardless of the

2839
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:41,849
long term direction that the

2840
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:43,050
organization takes and I do suspect you

2841
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:45,390
need to spend some quality time with

2842
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:47,070
that someone needs to be able to help

2843
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:50,400
the RSC production center with those

2844
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:52,500
day-to-day what about this field so

2845
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,969
please keep that in mind so can I ask

2846
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:55,890
you this question in a slightly more

2847
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:58,730
direct fashion then is it your advice to

2848
02:11:55,890 --> 02:12:03,000
the community that we do not pause the

2849
02:11:58,730 --> 02:12:05,400
RFP but we do seek to hire it even if

2850
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:11,760
it's only temporarily successor or is he

2851
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:14,309
at this time no I think having trying to

2852
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:18,210
find per telling the tools team perhaps

2853
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:19,650
to to take this part and run it I think

2854
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:22,350
trying to find an interim person is

2855
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:23,940
going to be wildly difficult for anyone

2856
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:26,700
you bring in for them to be able to do

2857
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:30,660
that job we run an XML vocabulary that's

2858
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:33,240
like nothing else in the world so I

2859
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:35,849
don't see you'll be able to find an

2860
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:37,050
expertise to do this role I think you'll

2861
02:12:35,850 --> 02:12:41,130
need to get it from within the community

2862
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:41,719
and then spend some time with the bigger

2863
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:42,949
picture

2864
02:12:41,719 --> 02:12:44,960
what do you actually want to hire for

2865
02:12:42,949 --> 02:12:45,619
going forward I see thank you for the

2866
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:47,900
clarification

2867
02:12:45,619 --> 02:12:49,728
I think Richard you were next hi this is

2868
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:51,710
Richard Barnes I'm sorry I'd like to

2869
02:12:49,729 --> 02:12:53,659
sound a bit of a note of positivity and

2870
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:55,909
thank the IAB in the are sock for the

2871
02:12:53,659 --> 02:12:57,619
oversight they've been doing to me

2872
02:12:55,909 --> 02:12:59,629
oversight is about back you know when

2873
02:12:57,619 --> 02:13:01,130
you're in oversight of a role it's about

2874
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:02,630
backstopping that role and paying

2875
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:04,460
attention to when there might be

2876
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:06,530
question marks or things signs that

2877
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:08,510
things might need attention and I think

2878
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:10,630
that's what I've seen out of the IAB on

2879
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:13,760
our side because is fulfilling that role

2880
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:15,320
but thinking back the last few times

2881
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:18,889
I've been at this plenary mic including

2882
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:21,889
perhaps like right on this spot have

2883
02:13:18,889 --> 02:13:23,630
been expressing concerns about you know

2884
02:13:21,889 --> 02:13:25,639
ways the RFC series needs to evolve

2885
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:28,610
whether that's in terms of SLA viola

2886
02:13:25,639 --> 02:13:30,139
violations or speed of processing or in

2887
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:32,210
terms of reaching out to stakeholder

2888
02:13:30,139 --> 02:13:33,679
communities the consumers of rfcs so

2889
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:34,940
like I think there there have been

2890
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:36,920
question marks that come through and I

2891
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:38,210
think it's it's the duty of the

2892
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:41,150
oversight bodies to be looking into

2893
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:42,829
those and taking a look and so I like to

2894
02:13:41,150 --> 02:13:44,869
thank the artists on the IAB for doing

2895
02:13:42,829 --> 02:13:46,249
that and invite them to continue

2896
02:13:44,869 --> 02:13:49,848
fulfilling the role that they've been

2897
02:13:46,249 --> 02:13:52,909
charted within the relevant rfcs and so

2898
02:13:49,849 --> 02:13:54,530
in that regard I kind of disagree with

2899
02:13:52,909 --> 02:13:55,820
this idea there's been a deep structural

2900
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:58,159
failure I think if we've had a

2901
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:59,539
disagreements and there's been

2902
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:01,549
unfortunate consequences of that

2903
02:13:59,539 --> 02:14:02,840
disagreements and we'll need to come

2904
02:14:01,550 --> 02:14:04,639
together as a community and think about

2905
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:06,409
how to move forward and in comes a

2906
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:07,579
better consensus on how we should

2907
02:14:06,409 --> 02:14:09,440
operate in the future and avoid these

2908
02:14:07,579 --> 02:14:10,518
sorts of disagreements in the future but

2909
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:12,799
I don't think there's a kind of deep

2910
02:14:10,519 --> 02:14:15,949
structural failing that some other

2911
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:17,840
speakers have mentioned and so in that

2912
02:14:15,949 --> 02:14:19,549
framing I'm a bit more optimistic than

2913
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:21,550
other folks about our ability to carry

2914
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:23,449
on here and kind of stay the course I

2915
02:14:21,550 --> 02:14:24,920
think I broadly agree with the two

2916
02:14:23,449 --> 02:14:27,558
alternatives that I raised we could have

2917
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:28,929
kind of a brief appoggiatura and take

2918
02:14:27,559 --> 02:14:30,889
some time breathing room and have a

2919
02:14:28,929 --> 02:14:33,739
vacancy while we use a community to

2920
02:14:30,889 --> 02:14:35,449
discuss this but I also think that I'm

2921
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:37,339
slightly more persuaded by the case that

2922
02:14:35,449 --> 02:14:38,749
we should go ahead and try and find an

2923
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:40,010
instruments as Heather points out

2924
02:14:38,749 --> 02:14:40,789
there's some operational issues that

2925
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:43,099
need attending to

2926
02:14:40,789 --> 02:14:44,570
I think it would also be useful to have

2927
02:14:43,099 --> 02:14:48,079
someone in that role to kind of guide

2928
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:50,030
the community concession and be kind of

2929
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:51,380
a focus point for for this conversation

2930
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:56,030
as we discuss the

2931
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:57,710
going forward so yeah I think I again

2932
02:14:56,030 --> 02:15:00,259
I'd like to thank the IAB in the arishok

2933
02:14:57,710 --> 02:15:02,390
and I think you know either these two

2934
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:03,950
options is acceptable but I have a

2935
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:05,380
slight preference for going ahead and

2936
02:15:03,950 --> 02:15:08,240
putting a candidate in the spot okay

2937
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:11,210
thanks for expressing preference Aaron

2938
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:13,130
Aaron fault so I completely disagree

2939
02:15:11,210 --> 02:15:16,400
with rich I think there's been a failure

2940
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:18,350
here you need to be a little bit closer

2941
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:20,809
to my Karen okay he takes my second to

2942
02:15:18,350 --> 02:15:23,530
turn the volume up so I think there's

2943
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:26,840
been a failure here I disagree with rich

2944
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:30,019
first let me apologize to you publicly

2945
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:32,620
Ted if you felt that I was harassing you

2946
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:35,330
on the ITF list I got some feedback that

2947
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:37,309
maybe I wasn't clear with what I was

2948
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:40,510
trying to get to and I was trying really

2949
02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:43,610
hard to not put words in your mouth but

2950
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:45,170
I did I was asking you know did the ID

2951
02:15:43,610 --> 02:15:46,099
think anything went wrong was there

2952
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:47,510
anything that could have done

2953
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:49,430
differently and I think that there were

2954
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:51,710
things that the IB did wrong and could

2955
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:54,050
have done differently but first the

2956
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:57,560
response was there was nothing wrong the

2957
02:15:54,050 --> 02:16:00,200
I agree I be was regretful then you said

2958
02:15:57,560 --> 02:16:02,180
that you thought the mistake was that

2959
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:05,330
you hadn't realized that heather was

2960
02:16:02,180 --> 02:16:07,040
unhappy this evening in this discussion

2961
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:08,780
you said well maybe the IB made a

2962
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:12,950
mistake because they made the change to

2963
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:17,990
the our sock Constitution or membership

2964
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:23,230
I think those were in fact mistakes and

2965
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:26,540
I was but I you know I don't think your

2966
02:16:23,230 --> 02:16:29,000
or the Ivy is arguing and bad faith

2967
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:32,270
about the sense of the stewardship role

2968
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,940
for the RFC series I've been on the IAB

2969
02:16:32,270 --> 02:16:37,010
and an ex-officio capacity in the past

2970
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:39,860
and I've always had that sense that the

2971
02:16:37,010 --> 02:16:43,180
IB felt like the RFC series was part of

2972
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:43,180
the things that it was responsible for

2973
02:16:43,719 --> 02:16:51,580
however I don't really sense I don't see

2974
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:54,530
that the ideas really acted like it was

2975
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:56,480
responsible for the RC series right an

2976
02:16:54,530 --> 02:16:59,631
interruption in the RC series or a major

2977
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:00,770
disruption the RC series you're

2978
02:16:59,630 --> 02:17:02,180
responsible for that right you're

2979
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:03,890
responsible for the RC series and now

2980
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:05,139
it's being disrupted it's being

2981
02:17:03,889 --> 02:17:08,529
disrupted because the

2982
02:17:05,139 --> 02:17:11,050
she has told us that she had the

2983
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:14,740
impression that her customer wasn't

2984
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:15,939
happy with her she sent that and I maybe

2985
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:18,309
you can confirm this but I believe that

2986
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:22,030
she sent that to you before it went to

2987
02:17:18,309 --> 02:17:25,389
the larger community so why didn't you

2988
02:17:22,030 --> 02:17:29,140
find out why why didn't if you think

2989
02:17:25,389 --> 02:17:31,960
that she misunderstood how the community

2990
02:17:29,139 --> 02:17:34,540
felt about her performance why didn't

2991
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:36,040
you try to rectify that maybe you know

2992
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:37,090
if you weren't happy with it if you

2993
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:38,620
thought there were no issues

2994
02:17:37,091 --> 02:17:41,650
why didn't you convince her of that

2995
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:43,960
before her resignation went public if I

2996
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:45,760
had a valued contractor one that was

2997
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:48,460
critical to the operation of my company

2998
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:52,180
and they said they were leaving I would

2999
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:54,070
try to turn them around and so I see

3000
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:59,470
that as a real failure of stewardship on

3001
02:17:54,070 --> 02:18:02,020
the Ivies part so - let me I have two

3002
02:17:59,469 --> 02:18:06,429
suggestions - positive - suggestions to

3003
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:07,780
move forward I think that the our Sauk

3004
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:10,240
members that were removed from the our

3005
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:12,700
Sauk should be added back in they bring

3006
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:16,091
expertise history for searching for an

3007
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:19,360
RSC they've done this before and I think

3008
02:18:16,091 --> 02:18:21,131
that the our sag and the iscb bring a

3009
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:23,591
lot of continuity and expertise in the

3010
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:25,421
RFC editors specifically going back to

3011
02:18:23,591 --> 02:18:26,621
when Bob Braden was ours together and I

3012
02:18:25,421 --> 02:18:28,240
think you should take advantage of them

3013
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:30,279
even if they aren't on your picture

3014
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:35,389
thank you

3015
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:38,970
[Applause]

3016
02:18:35,389 --> 02:18:40,800
hi this is honest I was in the IAB bun

3017
02:18:38,969 --> 02:18:44,789
version two of this model was created

3018
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:47,699
and all of % did it fairly nicely

3019
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:49,830
although still incomplete but it showed

3020
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:51,360
the complexity of all of this and when

3021
02:18:49,830 --> 02:18:53,100
it was written I had the impression it

3022
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:55,530
was already complicated for what we are

3023
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:58,290
doing in the IDF we are publishing

3024
02:18:55,530 --> 02:19:02,490
technical specifications and this to me

3025
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:05,880
looks like wily as as a as a sort of a

3026
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:07,980
publisher and I would encourage the idea

3027
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:10,379
to look into simplifying that model

3028
02:19:07,980 --> 02:19:12,750
because I think part of the problem is

3029
02:19:10,379 --> 02:19:15,089
that so many parties involved for

3030
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:15,360
something that is not just not big

3031
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:19,309
enough

3032
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:24,030
we just over engineered this process

3033
02:19:19,309 --> 02:19:25,800
Suresh so first of all I'd like to put

3034
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:27,720
positive stuff first like yeah Thank You

3035
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:29,309
Heather for your service and thank Sarah

3036
02:19:27,719 --> 02:19:31,129
for the apology I think it really

3037
02:19:29,309 --> 02:19:33,539
changed the tone of the conversation and

3038
02:19:31,129 --> 02:19:36,389
one thing I want to say is like if we

3039
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:39,030
want to change what 635 does we need to

3040
02:19:36,389 --> 02:19:41,099
change it I think it's like pretty tight

3041
02:19:39,030 --> 02:19:42,450
to talk about right now I like to say

3042
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:44,340
like okay we're gonna revisit this I

3043
02:19:42,450 --> 02:19:47,040
think it's gonna be a like difficult

3044
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:48,300
call to make specifically like relates

3045
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,950
to what Aaron said act for the

3046
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:53,100
disruption of the RSC series pretty much

3047
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:55,230
so I think we should at least for this

3048
02:19:53,101 --> 02:19:57,090
like cycle continue with the are sock

3049
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:59,880
like doing the selection and the IAB

3050
02:19:57,090 --> 02:20:02,250
like approving it pretty much said in 66

3051
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:04,410
35 and one thing I want to say is like

3052
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:05,521
with our C++ BA I think one of the

3053
02:20:04,410 --> 02:20:07,681
learnings is like you know we need to

3054
02:20:05,521 --> 02:20:09,210
come in connect to the community that we

3055
02:20:07,681 --> 02:20:11,610
have that's like consuming this stuff

3056
02:20:09,210 --> 02:20:14,130
and and a lot of the communities here

3057
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:16,980
okay like the IETF is here the IRT FS

3058
02:20:14,130 --> 02:20:18,539
year like IAB is here obviously but

3059
02:20:16,980 --> 02:20:21,840
there's also like other people outside

3060
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:23,070
like who are not here and I think some

3061
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,990
of the stuff that came up was like you

3062
02:20:23,070 --> 02:20:27,029
know we're not listening to them I think

3063
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:28,860
we should make an effort to reach out to

3064
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:31,740
the other people who are implementing

3065
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:33,150
our stuff and using our stuff to also

3066
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:34,410
find out the needs I think like some of

3067
02:20:33,150 --> 02:20:35,730
the stuff that Heather mentioned right

3068
02:20:34,410 --> 02:20:37,830
like you know the in liner that kind of

3069
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:40,189
thing like those are like really

3070
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:42,690
something that we need and I think

3071
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:45,240
taking all these things into account I

3072
02:20:42,690 --> 02:20:49,300
think it's like a really good idea

3073
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:51,010
Jeffrey you're next Jeffrey askin on the

3074
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:54,789
topic of leaving the series editor

3075
02:20:51,010 --> 02:20:58,150
position empty for a period we're we're

3076
02:20:54,790 --> 02:20:59,920
getting the new RFC format soon it

3077
02:20:58,150 --> 02:21:02,260
sounds like it's still going to be being

3078
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:05,980
debugged when we lose Heather at the end

3079
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:08,920
of the year and leaving leaving nobody

3080
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:10,240
in charge while that that new format is

3081
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:12,101
still being debugged it makes me nervous

3082
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:14,789
now Heather and the and the other

3083
02:21:12,101 --> 02:21:19,590
editors know best how to deal with that

3084
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:19,590
but I wanted to raise that as as I worry

3085
02:21:20,010 --> 02:21:25,330
thank you : you're next so when I first

3086
02:21:24,070 --> 02:21:27,550
heard about this and started digging

3087
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:28,870
into it my first reaction is well wow

3088
02:21:27,550 --> 02:21:30,340
something must have gone wrong here I

3089
02:21:28,870 --> 02:21:32,650
want to figure out what it was and I

3090
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:34,900
went back trying to read all of ITF at

3091
02:21:32,650 --> 02:21:36,369
ITF lists and that made me realize that

3092
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:37,960
we actually had a much larger problem

3093
02:21:36,370 --> 02:21:41,260
than this reading that list and there

3094
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:43,210
was a reason I didn't read it but after

3095
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:44,851
I worked on for a while I think that

3096
02:21:43,210 --> 02:21:47,710
we've heard this from multiple people

3097
02:21:44,851 --> 02:21:51,070
what we do going forward is is by far

3098
02:21:47,710 --> 02:21:53,320
more important here and I I worry

3099
02:21:51,070 --> 02:21:55,300
sometimes we have a very frustrating

3100
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:57,910
experience and then we make reactionary

3101
02:21:55,300 --> 02:22:00,400
adjustments to it you know I caution us

3102
02:21:57,910 --> 02:22:03,039
to proceed in a rational way that thinks

3103
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:04,930
about this stuff and sets up something

3104
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:06,430
that was in a reaction to a mistake or

3105
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:09,580
something that happened but instead is a

3106
02:22:06,430 --> 02:22:12,130
better way of doing this I heard

3107
02:22:09,580 --> 02:22:13,960
suggestions like the three-year rotating

3108
02:22:12,130 --> 02:22:15,130
term to keep continuity and those types

3109
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:17,470
of things and that type sounds like a

3110
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:19,150
very logical type of thing I also think

3111
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:21,820
that we should think that it's very

3112
02:22:19,150 --> 02:22:23,770
normal for any one of our groups that is

3113
02:22:21,820 --> 02:22:25,869
is responsible for contracts that are

3114
02:22:23,771 --> 02:22:27,340
one of our most expensive budget items

3115
02:22:25,870 --> 02:22:30,370
in this organization of producing the

3116
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:31,870
rfcs that that we would eat loop we

3117
02:22:30,370 --> 02:22:33,521
thought that the contractor didn't was

3118
02:22:31,870 --> 02:22:34,840
doing a wonderful job but we still would

3119
02:22:33,521 --> 02:22:35,890
ask about other prices for it

3120
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:37,800
periodically that had been normal

3121
02:22:35,890 --> 02:22:40,150
oversight I would expect from any

3122
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:41,949
business group spending large chunk of

3123
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:43,150
money as you decay tional each X you

3124
02:22:41,950 --> 02:22:44,410
know check that it was you're getting

3125
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:46,660
the right thing the best things you

3126
02:22:44,410 --> 02:22:47,351
could so I think that that's that's

3127
02:22:46,660 --> 02:22:50,560
pretty normal

3128
02:22:47,351 --> 02:22:53,439
I had a very hard time seeing a very

3129
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:55,300
a specific problem with the proce with

3130
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:57,970
the the structure it seems like our

3131
02:22:55,300 --> 02:23:00,159
structure is in many ways similar to any

3132
02:22:57,970 --> 02:23:01,688
other structure we didn't bend but I do

3133
02:23:00,159 --> 02:23:03,189
think we have to give more guidance on

3134
02:23:01,689 --> 02:23:04,449
what we want out of it and sort of think

3135
02:23:03,189 --> 02:23:05,979
of step back as a community think about

3136
02:23:04,449 --> 02:23:07,630
what are the things we can do to improve

3137
02:23:05,979 --> 02:23:09,899
that and then and then make those happen

3138
02:23:07,630 --> 02:23:12,640
over time Thanks

3139
02:23:09,899 --> 02:23:15,099
okay Henrik you're next

3140
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:16,420
I think the my clients have not drained

3141
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:18,399
I'm not going to try and cut anybody off

3142
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:20,500
but at some point we may need to move

3143
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:22,710
everybody to the front of the room so

3144
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:26,140
that they can start resetting the back

3145
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:27,819
so if folks who are in the back if you

3146
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:29,380
could consider moving front to allow

3147
02:23:27,819 --> 02:23:32,948
them to do that that'd be good Henrik

3148
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:36,028
you you can start the thing by by coming

3149
02:23:32,949 --> 02:23:36,029
to the front Thanks

3150
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:45,729
it's very Hendrik of Corvettes so yes I

3151
02:23:43,119 --> 02:23:50,259
think something went wrong I think we

3152
02:23:45,729 --> 02:23:54,640
need to look again at the setup of the

3153
02:23:50,259 --> 02:24:01,509
hora sock and the process but I have one

3154
02:23:54,640 --> 02:24:03,970
particular question for Ted I may be

3155
02:24:01,509 --> 02:24:10,299
wrong but I seem to recall that on the

3156
02:24:03,970 --> 02:24:13,618
or C++ of the two two new IEP members on

3157
02:24:10,299 --> 02:24:19,239
the our sock were quite vocal in

3158
02:24:13,619 --> 02:24:21,999
proposing quite dramatic changes did you

3159
02:24:19,239 --> 02:24:25,868
consider that putting them on the hora

3160
02:24:21,999 --> 02:24:29,560
sock might be a contributing action to

3161
02:24:25,869 --> 02:24:31,629
to conflict within the or sock and

3162
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:36,579
something that would spill over and make

3163
02:24:31,629 --> 02:24:38,289
Heather unhappy so I I think that we we

3164
02:24:36,579 --> 02:24:40,628
sent a message a year ago

3165
02:24:38,289 --> 02:24:42,520
pretty much exactly about the output of

3166
02:24:40,629 --> 02:24:44,470
the RF C++ boffin acknowledged that

3167
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:47,619
there were not just one but I think I

3168
02:24:44,470 --> 02:24:50,198
count seven mistakes in it among them

3169
02:24:47,619 --> 02:24:52,509
some of the early consultation issues

3170
02:24:50,199 --> 02:24:55,749
and it's clear that there was an eighth

3171
02:24:52,509 --> 02:24:57,520
mistake and that was at the at the end

3172
02:24:55,749 --> 02:25:00,909
of that we were very clear that the

3173
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:01,930
community wanted Heather to take the

3174
02:25:00,909 --> 02:25:05,378
lead in the further evolution

3175
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:07,979
discussions that not us and you know we

3176
02:25:05,379 --> 02:25:10,149
thought that that was done apparently it

3177
02:25:07,979 --> 02:25:12,310
it continued to be a source of

3178
02:25:10,149 --> 02:25:14,979
frustration for her enough that when a

3179
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:16,899
later of frustration is this last straw

3180
02:25:14,979 --> 02:25:18,698
on the camel's back it was one of the

3181
02:25:16,899 --> 02:25:21,278
things she cited in her message to the

3182
02:25:18,699 --> 02:25:22,839
community as one of the issues that that

3183
02:25:21,279 --> 02:25:26,079
had caused her to decide it was better

3184
02:25:22,839 --> 02:25:28,209
for her to go away that we were no

3185
02:25:26,079 --> 02:25:30,458
longer aligned we didn't think that it

3186
02:25:28,209 --> 02:25:33,699
was any more a question of alignment we

3187
02:25:30,459 --> 02:25:36,520
thought we had aligned with the

3188
02:25:33,699 --> 02:25:38,859
community on that and it's clearly a

3189
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:40,779
mistake that that was not sufficiently

3190
02:25:38,859 --> 02:25:43,089
communicated to either her or the

3191
02:25:40,779 --> 02:25:45,759
community that that that was no longer

3192
02:25:43,089 --> 02:25:48,669
something we were either advocating for

3193
02:25:45,759 --> 02:25:50,660
or expecting that answer your question

3194
02:25:48,669 --> 02:25:54,051
not really

3195
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:57,740
my question is about the potential for a

3196
02:25:54,051 --> 02:25:59,900
built-in conflict or built-in tension in

3197
02:25:57,740 --> 02:26:03,251
the horse oak as a result of putting two

3198
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:07,160
people who had been vocal in advocating

3199
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:10,490
quite big changes on their they were

3200
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:11,690
they were put potentially not so so

3201
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:13,369
neither of the people who were put on

3202
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:14,690
the air sock were proponents for the

3203
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:17,931
buff and one of them wasn't even on the

3204
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:22,400
IAB at the time no I quite clearly

3205
02:26:17,931 --> 02:26:25,541
recall mark being very vocal in the or

3206
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:27,891
C++ am I wrong am I mistaken

3207
02:26:25,541 --> 02:26:29,869
I'd love to talk to you more about that

3208
02:26:27,891 --> 02:26:36,320
because it's not my recollection okay my

3209
02:26:29,870 --> 02:26:37,910
recollection is is that I we should talk

3210
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:41,541
because that's really not my

3211
02:26:37,910 --> 02:26:46,820
recollection so there are some different

3212
02:26:41,541 --> 02:26:49,600
perceptions there I'll talk more okay

3213
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:52,341
thanks Leslie Daigle so I have a

3214
02:26:49,601 --> 02:26:54,051
question for you either you Ted or are

3215
02:26:52,341 --> 02:26:58,461
you representing the ivy or whatever and

3216
02:26:54,051 --> 02:27:00,471
I want to give my answer and then answer

3217
02:26:58,461 --> 02:27:04,820
your question about filling the slot so

3218
02:27:00,471 --> 02:27:08,359
the question is on a continuum from the

3219
02:27:04,820 --> 02:27:11,119
RFC plus bofto now I think we can agree

3220
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:13,820
we've encountered some uncomfortable

3221
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:16,671
situations with the RFC editor and the

3222
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:22,011
RFC series what do you think's good

3223
02:27:16,671 --> 02:27:23,331
looks like but I'm sorry I don't really

3224
02:27:22,011 --> 02:27:25,461
understand how I can answer that

3225
02:27:23,331 --> 02:27:27,200
retrospectively I'm not asking you to

3226
02:27:25,461 --> 02:27:29,359
answer it retrospectively I'm offering

3227
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:32,480
they that past year and the discomfort

3228
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:36,190
as the problem has to be solved so given

3229
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:36,189
that what do you think good looks like

3230
02:27:36,791 --> 02:27:41,570
so I don't think we can get back to the

3231
02:27:39,561 --> 02:27:43,541
status quo ante given what's happened so

3232
02:27:41,570 --> 02:27:46,730
far so I think what good looks like

3233
02:27:43,541 --> 02:27:48,680
starts by having the community come to

3234
02:27:46,730 --> 02:27:52,100
an agreement about whether they wants to

3235
02:27:48,681 --> 02:27:54,501
bring in a Nora C to help the future

3236
02:27:52,101 --> 02:27:56,751
discussion now or as close to now as we

3237
02:27:54,501 --> 02:27:59,331
can make it and with the acknowledgement

3238
02:27:56,751 --> 02:28:01,101
that John had brought up earlier of

3239
02:27:59,331 --> 02:28:03,440
needing to stretch beyond the

3240
02:28:01,101 --> 02:28:04,431
increasingly small number of people

3241
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:07,370
that's in this

3242
02:28:04,431 --> 02:28:10,670
and after that to finish the community

3243
02:28:07,370 --> 02:28:14,030
discussion of what changes need to

3244
02:28:10,670 --> 02:28:15,650
happen here and I think given some of

3245
02:28:14,030 --> 02:28:18,290
the issues that Bob Hindon raised those

3246
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:20,570
changes might in fact mean that it's no

3247
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:23,360
longer the IEP which appoints the our

3248
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:26,529
sock at all that its role changes quite

3249
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:29,210
significantly as a result of this I

3250
02:28:26,530 --> 02:28:30,530
actually think that the right thing to

3251
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:33,439
happen is to make sure that the

3252
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:36,261
community believes and has the

3253
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:39,261
structures in place to make sure that

3254
02:28:36,261 --> 02:28:41,990
the function goes forward in the future

3255
02:28:39,261 --> 02:28:44,750
whether the IAB remains involved in that

3256
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:46,730
or not is not nearly as important as

3257
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:49,940
making sure that the community has

3258
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:52,430
confidence in those structures okay

3259
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:54,490
thank you because I think that was

3260
02:28:52,431 --> 02:28:58,431
definitely responsive to my question and

3261
02:28:54,490 --> 02:29:01,641
my answer to the question aligns with

3262
02:28:58,431 --> 02:29:05,210
much of it if not all my answer is that

3263
02:29:01,641 --> 02:29:07,279
a year from now I would like the IETF

3264
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:10,400
and the internet technical community as

3265
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:14,570
a whole which are impacted by this

3266
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:17,631
situation to have confidence that we are

3267
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:20,931
all on the same page about what the RSC

3268
02:29:17,631 --> 02:29:24,170
is what the RSC series is and that the

3269
02:29:20,931 --> 02:29:26,360
people who are making the decisions not

3270
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:29,511
only agree with what that is but are

3271
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:31,610
also empowered to make it happen I think

3272
02:29:29,511 --> 02:29:35,450
that from my perspective the RFC plus

3273
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:38,540
boss in some ways broke my confidence

3274
02:29:35,450 --> 02:29:41,900
that I am the IAB actually have the same

3275
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:44,450
view of what the RSC series is and that

3276
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:45,859
confidence is not yet restored I'm not

3277
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:50,210
sure that it's going to be addressed by

3278
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:53,450
structural issues but by way of getting

3279
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:58,400
to confidence as the target again I want

3280
02:29:53,450 --> 02:30:01,851
to reiterate that the fact that the that

3281
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:05,150
we have lost the contractor for this

3282
02:30:01,851 --> 02:30:07,641
role at a time not of our choosing is

3283
02:30:05,150 --> 02:30:09,529
actually a problem not just for the IETF

3284
02:30:07,641 --> 02:30:12,619
but for the broader internet technical

3285
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:14,870
community that this series is meant to

3286
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:15,860
serve and I'd really like to feel more

3287
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:18,351
confident that the eye

3288
02:30:15,860 --> 02:30:20,601
he remembers that as we go forward and

3289
02:30:18,351 --> 02:30:22,130
then finally to your question of whether

3290
02:30:20,601 --> 02:30:24,130
or not to repopulated attempt to

3291
02:30:22,130 --> 02:30:26,480
repopulate the rse position at this time

3292
02:30:24,130 --> 02:30:28,699
the only thing I would say is if you

3293
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:31,311
elect not to do that please put a hard

3294
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:33,681
time limit before you will because if we

3295
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:36,529
just say when we have consensus it might

3296
02:30:33,681 --> 02:30:38,870
be a while that's a very important point

3297
02:30:36,530 --> 02:30:42,771
thank you Richard

3298
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:45,610
yeah an observation with no value

3299
02:30:42,771 --> 02:30:48,650
assessed to it in terms of judgment

3300
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:51,681
you're the only one who's spoken thank

3301
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:53,391
you so rich that was largely to make

3302
02:30:51,681 --> 02:30:55,160
sure that we were not all trying to

3303
02:30:53,391 --> 02:30:57,141
speak and therefore taking more time

3304
02:30:55,160 --> 02:31:06,830
with us talking than listening that's

3305
02:30:57,141 --> 02:31:11,539
why Brian Dixon godaddy a longtime

3306
02:31:06,830 --> 02:31:14,690
listener first-time caller so looking at

3307
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:16,641
this with kind of shock on my face I'm

3308
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:18,650
apologized but I definitely want to

3309
02:31:16,641 --> 02:31:23,270
extend my thanks as just an ordinary

3310
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:25,971
participant the way I would look at the

3311
02:31:23,271 --> 02:31:28,820
RFC series editor position would be

3312
02:31:25,971 --> 02:31:33,949
potentially more akin to like a C Series

3313
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:37,250
suite type role and the our Sauk role I

3314
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:39,710
would say better would align with like a

3315
02:31:37,250 --> 02:31:43,641
board of directors and board of

3316
02:31:39,710 --> 02:31:46,971
directors for a corporation has the best

3317
02:31:43,641 --> 02:31:48,920
value when it has a lot of stability and

3318
02:31:46,971 --> 02:31:52,869
I don't know I don't know what the rules

3319
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:56,240
are how the constituency of the our sock

3320
02:31:52,870 --> 02:31:59,420
is maintained where they're drawn from

3321
02:31:56,240 --> 02:32:03,160
etc etc but I think having a better

3322
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:06,620
dialogue with the RFC series editor on

3323
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:11,000
the constituency and those long-term

3324
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:15,980
direction and having much less change

3325
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:20,330
occur and having it be not duration

3326
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:23,000
durin but more responsibility or vision

3327
02:32:20,330 --> 02:32:25,341
driven like it would be in any kind of

3328
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:27,950
bigger board type of thing there's no

3329
02:32:25,341 --> 02:32:28,891
reason not to that I could see and I

3330
02:32:27,950 --> 02:32:31,681
would say that

3331
02:32:28,891 --> 02:32:35,160
along with that as much as the RFC

3332
02:32:31,681 --> 02:32:37,290
series editor is a paid role I do not

3333
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:41,391
think it should be viewed the same as a

3334
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:45,511
contractor it should be viewed as a limp

3335
02:32:41,391 --> 02:32:48,811
semi limited role with the expectation

3336
02:32:45,511 --> 02:32:50,851
of as long as it's being done well the

3337
02:32:48,811 --> 02:32:53,971
it's up to the decision of the our sock

3338
02:32:50,851 --> 02:32:58,200
to replace or not but it shouldn't be

3339
02:32:53,971 --> 02:33:00,770
driven by a particular scheduling or

3340
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:03,900
duration of contracts I think

3341
02:33:00,771 --> 02:33:06,570
restructuring it along those lines may

3342
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:09,029
have better results in terms of the

3343
02:33:06,570 --> 02:33:12,061
people you attract and possibly even who

3344
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:13,530
you can retain that's so do you mean an

3345
02:33:12,061 --> 02:33:15,570
employee relationship is that what you

3346
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:17,910
am yes I mean look at it exactly the

3347
02:33:15,570 --> 02:33:21,420
same as an employee relationship for a

3348
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:24,570
CEO CEO reports to the board at the will

3349
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:26,400
of the board but is expected to retain

3350
02:33:24,570 --> 02:33:29,610
that role unless there's some mutual

3351
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:33,380
disagreement or reason to leave or you

3352
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:33,380
know contractual just this disagreement

3353
02:33:34,011 --> 02:33:36,931
you'd like to get a quick response but

3354
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:39,000
please make it quick

3355
02:33:36,931 --> 02:33:40,650
sure very quickly I I think that we've

3356
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,011
had some discussion on the I asset to

3357
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:42,721
list

3358
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:44,160
and during the discussion I expressed

3359
02:33:42,721 --> 02:33:46,471
opposition to the idea of the Earth's

3360
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:48,200
aura see as an employee various reasons

3361
02:33:46,471 --> 02:33:50,100
that are on that list so I think there's

3362
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:54,351
the rest of your comments I tell you

3363
02:33:50,101 --> 02:33:54,351
agreement but that part don't for me

3364
02:33:55,910 --> 02:34:00,150
Tigra n--

3365
02:33:57,110 --> 02:34:03,511
meta comments lost concern I think I see

3366
02:34:00,150 --> 02:34:04,980
a there's kind of watching some of this

3367
02:34:03,511 --> 02:34:06,601
dialogue and watching some of the

3368
02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:09,180
conversations in the ITF list and

3369
02:34:06,601 --> 02:34:10,710
looking at it as a observer I see some

3370
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:13,200
of it I think echo alluded to this in

3371
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:15,391
one of his comments of the community

3372
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:18,841
trying to do an incident review by

3373
02:34:15,391 --> 02:34:20,520
plenary or micromanaging people we put

3374
02:34:18,841 --> 02:34:22,351
it in a leadership role by plenary or

3375
02:34:20,521 --> 02:34:25,500
trying to do design by plenary and it's

3376
02:34:22,351 --> 02:34:27,360
unclear how constructive that is I think

3377
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:28,980
at some point there we have a set of

3378
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:33,630
people that we put in a leadership role

3379
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:35,430
and they've and having been in those

3380
02:34:33,630 --> 02:34:37,080
types of roles before trying to have the

3381
02:34:35,431 --> 02:34:38,971
whole community mic room kind of

3382
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:41,430
second-guessing decisions that were made

3383
02:34:38,971 --> 02:34:43,140
that were presumably made in good faith

3384
02:34:41,430 --> 02:34:45,630
not really a healthy way to run the

3385
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:48,210
community and at some point we have to

3386
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:51,420
assume that the people we in the IAB and

3387
02:34:48,210 --> 02:34:54,300
the Artsakh are acting in a good faith

3388
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:56,550
leadership role and are listening to the

3389
02:34:54,300 --> 02:34:58,800
inputs and and comments that we're

3390
02:34:56,550 --> 02:35:01,019
giving to them but trying to go and have

3391
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:02,970
the entire community micromanaging and

3392
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:05,640
trying to second-guess every single

3393
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:08,220
decision they are has a risk of creating

3394
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:10,229
an unhealthy environment in an

3395
02:35:08,220 --> 02:35:11,698
environment where NomCom was asking

3396
02:35:10,229 --> 02:35:14,460
earlier like hey we have trouble getting

3397
02:35:11,699 --> 02:35:17,340
people into leadership roles the we

3398
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:18,630
should be asking ourselves if people who

3399
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:20,220
are in those leadership roles are

3400
02:35:18,630 --> 02:35:22,050
feeling like every if they make a

3401
02:35:20,220 --> 02:35:25,229
mistake and then say sorry we made a

3402
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:26,789
mistake and start trying to say in good

3403
02:35:25,229 --> 02:35:29,188
faith look at what they did to make that

3404
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:30,239
kind of made that mistake and try to

3405
02:35:29,189 --> 02:35:33,029
figure out how do they improve that

3406
02:35:30,239 --> 02:35:34,470
going forward if people feel like even

3407
02:35:33,029 --> 02:35:35,670
that they do that the entire community

3408
02:35:34,470 --> 02:35:37,560
is gonna be constantly second-guessing

3409
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:38,760
them it's gonna be hard to get people

3410
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:41,880
are gonna be interested in going into

3411
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:43,229
leadership roles going forwards so just

3412
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:44,789
to quickly respond to that well I

3413
02:35:43,229 --> 02:35:47,160
certainly hope that everybody believes

3414
02:35:44,790 --> 02:35:48,810
we're acting in good faith being in

3415
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:50,399
front of the plenary and answering

3416
02:35:48,810 --> 02:35:52,500
questions the community and listening

3417
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:54,510
community is one of the primary

3418
02:35:52,500 --> 02:35:57,859
accountability mechanisms that has been

3419
02:35:54,510 --> 02:36:00,930
built into the ITF and I think that

3420
02:35:57,859 --> 02:36:02,609
probably the worst possible result of

3421
02:36:00,930 --> 02:36:06,149
all of this would be losing it so I

3422
02:36:02,609 --> 02:36:08,790
think as much as this is a difficult way

3423
02:36:06,149 --> 02:36:12,319
of getting things done we we need to

3424
02:36:08,790 --> 02:36:12,319
listen and we need to listen in public

3425
02:36:14,899 --> 02:36:21,300
hi I'm Adrian Farrell I'm the

3426
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:24,239
independent submissions editor some

3427
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:26,670
quick thanks thanks for you staying up

3428
02:36:24,239 --> 02:36:28,560
there facilitating this and risking your

3429
02:36:26,670 --> 02:36:31,920
blood sugar levels

3430
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:33,420
thanks to Ola for what turns out to be

3431
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:38,340
really helpful

3432
02:36:33,420 --> 02:36:42,029
slide set along the way Olaf mentioned

3433
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:44,489
the four streams that feed the RSC

3434
02:36:42,029 --> 02:36:46,800
series and I think Ted you introduced a

3435
02:36:44,489 --> 02:36:49,140
term that hadn't come up from our life

3436
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:52,500
which was the stream managers so that's

3437
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:54,330
the people responsible in some inverted

3438
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:57,270
commas for the streams

3439
02:36:54,330 --> 02:36:59,010
I wondered along the way lots of

3440
02:36:57,270 --> 02:37:01,890
decisions have been made by people on

3441
02:36:59,010 --> 02:37:05,399
the platform at the moment and and

3442
02:37:01,890 --> 02:37:08,069
elsewhere and in the future lots of

3443
02:37:05,399 --> 02:37:11,399
decisions event and need to be made as

3444
02:37:08,069 --> 02:37:14,810
well what efforts were made and will be

3445
02:37:11,399 --> 02:37:18,569
made to consult the stream managers

3446
02:37:14,810 --> 02:37:20,039
about those decisions so I think that

3447
02:37:18,569 --> 02:37:22,949
this is one of the structural changes we

3448
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:26,130
may have to make that the way that the

3449
02:37:22,950 --> 02:37:28,020
system is currently set up the our Sauk

3450
02:37:26,130 --> 02:37:30,240
and the stream managers don't actually

3451
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:32,430
have a good interface other than just

3452
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:34,560
talking to each other and that it may be

3453
02:37:32,430 --> 02:37:37,380
necessary to institute a much more

3454
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:40,529
structural relationship if if that's

3455
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:42,660
what we want to see yes I think maybe if

3456
02:37:40,530 --> 02:37:46,790
that's what we need because just talking

3457
02:37:42,660 --> 02:37:46,789
to each other should work just fine okay

3458
02:37:48,030 --> 02:37:52,770
Bret Jordan some of the comments tonight

3459
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:55,649
have referred to Heather in the abstract

3460
02:37:52,770 --> 02:37:57,540
and she's a person and I think we need

3461
02:37:55,649 --> 02:38:02,250
to realize that we are losing Heather

3462
02:37:57,540 --> 02:38:05,280
and I think that we should it's like

3463
02:38:02,250 --> 02:38:07,740
thank her for her sacrifice and her

3464
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:09,660
service and more care and feeding of

3465
02:38:07,740 --> 02:38:10,609
your employees would be really good on

3466
02:38:09,660 --> 02:38:13,140
your part

3467
02:38:10,609 --> 02:38:15,320
well if we'd like to do another standing

3468
02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:18,378
ovation on certainly willings

3469
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:18,378
[Applause]

3470
02:38:29,189 --> 02:38:43,960
you all have had the capability of being

3471
02:38:32,170 --> 02:38:46,779
very kind is that negotiated oh yeah

3472
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:48,089
that was um but the point he's made is

3473
02:38:46,779 --> 02:38:51,550
something that I would also like to

3474
02:38:48,090 --> 02:38:53,529
touch on in heathers note and in the

3475
02:38:51,550 --> 02:38:57,220
discussion here it's clear that there

3476
02:38:53,529 --> 02:39:00,490
was not enough open communication and

3477
02:38:57,220 --> 02:39:03,069
checking in on her and on the concerns

3478
02:39:00,490 --> 02:39:05,350
that had been raised and I would like to

3479
02:39:03,069 --> 02:39:09,149
know what your plans are for checking in

3480
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:12,040
on all of the other incredibly critical

3481
02:39:09,149 --> 02:39:16,470
contractors and volunteers and making

3482
02:39:12,040 --> 02:39:16,470
sure that they are not in similar states

3483
02:39:17,850 --> 02:39:25,270
so that that's a really good question we

3484
02:39:21,609 --> 02:39:29,170
do have some methods of working with AAA

3485
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:31,120
most folks in less than formal

3486
02:39:29,170 --> 02:39:32,620
structures and I think those are avenues

3487
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:34,390
where we could might potentially learn

3488
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:36,100
of that but it's probably something that

3489
02:39:34,390 --> 02:39:38,439
we need to work with the LLC board on

3490
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:40,060
since the IEP actually doesn't have

3491
02:39:38,439 --> 02:39:41,500
formal relationships with many of those

3492
02:39:40,060 --> 02:39:43,390
other contractors but thanks for raising

3493
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:46,750
the issue not just on tractors

3494
02:39:43,390 --> 02:39:48,490
volunteers and also their people we

3495
02:39:46,750 --> 02:39:50,649
talked to each other a built a team I

3496
02:39:48,490 --> 02:39:53,050
mean it's the formal and the informal

3497
02:39:50,649 --> 02:39:56,590
and that's what I'm hearing was missing

3498
02:39:53,050 --> 02:39:57,519
thank you very much okay Richard I know

3499
02:39:56,590 --> 02:39:58,689
you've been up at the thing before

3500
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:00,910
please make it as short because we've

3501
02:39:58,689 --> 02:40:02,140
got a short amount of time left I'm

3502
02:40:00,910 --> 02:40:03,490
seeing Alexis showing up looking

3503
02:40:02,140 --> 02:40:06,490
threatening I'm happy to yield to John

3504
02:40:03,490 --> 02:40:08,080
because I think he was up before me I've

3505
02:40:06,490 --> 02:40:10,060
also been here before this will be very

3506
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:11,620
brief but I've heard something a couple

3507
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:15,189
of times tonight a couple of times as a

3508
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:16,960
list which needs clarification if I

3509
02:40:15,189 --> 02:40:21,430
decided to go down to the local hardware

3510
02:40:16,960 --> 02:40:25,509
store and buy a kilogram of Tenpenny

3511
02:40:21,430 --> 02:40:27,399
Canadian standard nails because they are

3512
02:40:25,510 --> 02:40:29,800
Canadian standard there is a Canadian

3513
02:40:27,399 --> 02:40:32,349
standard for ten many nails at a

3514
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:34,300
Canadian standard four kilogram I know

3515
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:36,580
what I'm getting and if I decide to go

3516
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:38,619
to next hardware store and do price

3517
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:40,660
comparisons I can do that in a reliable

3518
02:40:38,620 --> 02:40:43,860
way you

3519
02:40:40,660 --> 02:40:48,160
we start talking about bidding these

3520
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:51,220
contracts on a competitive price basis

3521
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:53,800
we are in deep deep trouble because we

3522
02:40:51,220 --> 02:40:56,380
are insulting the people whom we would

3523
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:58,660
most want to do the jobs and we are

3524
02:40:56,380 --> 02:41:02,109
going to get ourselves exactly what we

3525
02:40:58,660 --> 02:41:04,690
deserve so let's be very very careful

3526
02:41:02,110 --> 02:41:06,940
about a vocabulary which starts talking

3527
02:41:04,690 --> 02:41:10,720
about recompete anis things periodically

3528
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:12,970
to get a better price thank you I think

3529
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:14,561
that the point was made on the list that

3530
02:41:12,970 --> 02:41:16,570
in the past these have never been

3531
02:41:14,561 --> 02:41:18,789
actually evaluated on the price and I

3532
02:41:16,570 --> 02:41:20,250
think it's unlikely that we would ever

3533
02:41:18,790 --> 02:41:22,480
go to that point Richard you're next

3534
02:41:20,250 --> 02:41:23,380
yeah I just like to briefly revisit a

3535
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:24,850
point that some points that were made

3536
02:41:23,380 --> 02:41:27,100
earlier about the composition of the RS

3537
02:41:24,851 --> 02:41:28,540
I can say perhaps unsurprisingly I have

3538
02:41:27,101 --> 02:41:30,370
a little bit more positive view than it

3539
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:32,650
was an instant Express here I think the

3540
02:41:30,370 --> 02:41:34,840
current our stock has a good blend of

3541
02:41:32,650 --> 02:41:36,311
experience and new thinking folks

3542
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:38,380
representing different aspects of the

3543
02:41:36,311 --> 02:41:39,641
community so I'm actually quite pleased

3544
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:41,230
with the current artists on I feel like

3545
02:41:39,641 --> 02:41:41,830
they've been as I said earlier doing a

3546
02:41:41,230 --> 02:41:44,439
pretty good job

3547
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:46,510
oversight I'm also deeply uncomfortable

3548
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:48,460
with another notion that was raised here

3549
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:50,230
of consulting the broader Internet

3550
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:52,359
community as Christiane pointed out on

3551
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:54,641
the lists like there's it's really hard

3552
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:57,070
to get to the whole internet that's

3553
02:41:54,641 --> 02:41:58,660
really big and you know as we're seeing

3554
02:41:57,070 --> 02:42:00,070
here if you look around the room we're

3555
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:01,840
having trouble getting the committed

3556
02:42:00,070 --> 02:42:12,580
IETF community to show up for these

3557
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:14,170
discussions so can you repeat what she

3558
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:21,610
said because nobody up here could hear

3559
02:42:14,170 --> 02:42:23,440
it I said it still represents the entire

3560
02:42:21,610 --> 02:42:25,271
technical community whether or not you

3561
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:27,220
can consult it it's a part of the RFC

3562
02:42:25,271 --> 02:42:29,141
series we actually don't get to redefine

3563
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:31,480
that but I mean at some point we need to

3564
02:42:29,141 --> 02:42:33,070
represent people a concrete group of

3565
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:35,561
people and the needs of the concrete

3566
02:42:33,070 --> 02:42:37,270
folks who are showing up in the room and

3567
02:42:35,561 --> 02:42:39,610
doing work and producing these things

3568
02:42:37,271 --> 02:42:41,320
and the people who are using who are you

3569
02:42:39,610 --> 02:42:44,170
and the community of the people who are

3570
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:46,090
using them to get those work hey we're

3571
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:49,330
we're listening at this point he stated

3572
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:51,370
his opinion we can move on henrik i

3573
02:42:49,330 --> 02:42:52,720
think we have to go ahead and say we're

3574
02:42:51,370 --> 02:42:54,100
done taking new people in because we're

3575
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:57,999
now seriously over time

3576
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:59,229
like over an hour overtime so I'm gonna

3577
02:42:57,999 --> 02:43:01,119
drain the queue on this side since it

3578
02:42:59,229 --> 02:43:05,470
was already occupied

3579
02:43:01,119 --> 02:43:08,129
Eliot Thank You Ted Thank You ivy for

3580
02:43:05,470 --> 02:43:11,198
staying late and I'd like to also thank

3581
02:43:08,129 --> 02:43:12,850
colleagues here I think generally that

3582
02:43:11,199 --> 02:43:15,819
we've had a pretty positive discussion

3583
02:43:12,850 --> 02:43:19,449
here and I think we should all recognize

3584
02:43:15,819 --> 02:43:22,060
that I understand I I can see that

3585
02:43:19,449 --> 02:43:23,800
there's still a lot of passion that

3586
02:43:22,060 --> 02:43:25,149
people have and there are ideas that

3587
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:29,470
they haven't had the opportunity to

3588
02:43:25,149 --> 02:43:31,868
express one of the things I think the

3589
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:34,118
most important question I have is where

3590
02:43:31,869 --> 02:43:35,439
do we go from here in terms of how do

3591
02:43:34,119 --> 02:43:38,169
you want to structure the conversation

3592
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:39,459
going forward Ted okay I think that the

3593
02:43:38,169 --> 02:43:41,739
short answer is we're probably going to

3594
02:43:39,459 --> 02:43:43,180
make a very quick decision about whether

3595
02:43:41,739 --> 02:43:46,810
this needs a new mailing list or whether

3596
02:43:43,180 --> 02:43:49,680
we'll reuse RFC interest after that

3597
02:43:46,810 --> 02:43:53,919
decision will write up a short

3598
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:56,319
reflection on this meeting and post it

3599
02:43:53,919 --> 02:43:59,979
to the ITF artsy interest and if there

3600
02:43:56,319 --> 02:44:01,989
is a new list to that list and put put

3601
02:43:59,979 --> 02:44:05,260
out the the rest of the discussion from

3602
02:44:01,989 --> 02:44:07,538
that point I have a strong belief at

3603
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:10,869
this point that one of the key risks

3604
02:44:07,539 --> 02:44:13,359
that Heather articulated was that if the

3605
02:44:10,869 --> 02:44:16,199
ball gets dropped during this period of

3606
02:44:13,359 --> 02:44:18,789
transition in the format there may be a

3607
02:44:16,199 --> 02:44:20,260
set of issues that makes it even more

3608
02:44:18,789 --> 02:44:23,339
difficult to bring somebody in

3609
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:26,859
afterwards as a result of that I think

3610
02:44:23,339 --> 02:44:28,689
the most likely result here even though

3611
02:44:26,859 --> 02:44:32,739
there were very clear articulations for

3612
02:44:28,689 --> 02:44:34,959
why we might want to wait until further

3613
02:44:32,739 --> 02:44:37,538
community discussion occurred that we

3614
02:44:34,959 --> 02:44:40,060
will probably say that having the

3615
02:44:37,539 --> 02:44:43,689
ability to overlap with Heather is

3616
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:46,839
probably an overriding concern but

3617
02:44:43,689 --> 02:44:49,570
that's the the reflection that we'll go

3618
02:44:46,839 --> 02:44:51,029
to the lists for further discussion

3619
02:44:49,570 --> 02:44:54,220
[Music]

3620
02:44:51,029 --> 02:44:58,350
Sarah you're gonna have the I will be

3621
02:44:54,220 --> 02:45:00,909
incredibly quick two points yes

3622
02:44:58,350 --> 02:45:02,409
generally in our technical designs we

3623
02:45:00,909 --> 02:45:02,779
try to avoid single points of failure I

3624
02:45:02,409 --> 02:45:04,820
wouldn't

3625
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:07,460
courage people to think about that as we

3626
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:09,800
go forward in terms of structure second

3627
02:45:07,460 --> 02:45:11,029
the primary purpose is fluid Hana said

3628
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:13,279
of this organization is to publish

3629
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:14,811
technical specifications and whatever we

3630
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:16,610
structure we choose has to serve that

3631
02:45:14,811 --> 02:45:18,891
ultimately thank you thank you

3632
02:45:16,610 --> 02:45:21,200
and let me add at the final moment to

3633
02:45:18,891 --> 02:45:22,699
thank you to all of you who came to this

3634
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:25,910
part of the plenary and gave your

3635
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:27,830
thoughts to each other and the IAB and

3636
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:29,210
the are sock on this set of points I

3637
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:32,271
realize it's been a very emotional

3638
02:45:29,210 --> 02:45:33,859
couple of weeks for many and I also

3639
02:45:32,271 --> 02:45:34,730
appreciate the collegial and

3640
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:38,120
professional manner

3641
02:45:34,730 --> 02:45:39,850
you all participated in thank you very

3642
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:43,339
much

3643
02:45:39,850 --> 02:45:43,339
[Applause]

3644
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:55,319
