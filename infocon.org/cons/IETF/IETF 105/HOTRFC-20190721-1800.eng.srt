1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,550
Oh

2
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,290
okay we're in business

3
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,579
sorry about starting a a little bit late

4
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,180
because we actually have a very full

5
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,650
agenda so my name is Aaron Falk this is

6
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,970
the hot RFC lightning talk series I'm

7
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,360
happy that you all have come this is I

8
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,400
think the fourth or maybe fifth time

9
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,540
that we've run this the idea of this

10
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,690
session is to have a series of

11
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,780
introductory talks to give folks who are

12
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,790
doing something new in the IETF a way to

13
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,640
get the word out and so it's especially

14
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,579
good for things that cross areas are new

15
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,458
to the IETF maybe coming in from the IRT

16
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,680
F or a boss that sort of thing to just

17
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,540
give a very short synopsis with some

18
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,900
coordinates on how to get involved or

19
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,780
learn more if you're interested we have

20
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,630
about 22 talks tonight so we've got a

21
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,280
very full agenda still should come in

22
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,720
under the two-hour slots so if you've

23
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,660
made dinner plans I think you'll still

24
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,609
be able to to make them but the way that

25
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,280
we're going to do that is through very

26
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,640
strict time limits so we're using the

27
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,200
large set time management method and so

28
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,670
at the end of four minutes if the

29
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,029
speaker hasn't concluded you should hear

30
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,029
this sound

31
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,730
at which point I'd like everybody in the

32
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,690
room to start clapping and thank our

33
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,169
speaker very good guys have got the

34
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,180
right idea

35
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,930
now all that comes down to my ability to

36
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,090
push the button correctly let's see on

37
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,380
the material site you should find all

38
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,070
the slides that you're gonna see tonight

39
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:41,860
as well as abstracts that summarize the

40
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,870
talks and include the coordinates for

41
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,169
finding out more information so there's

42
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,640
not gonna be any time for a QA yeah it's

43
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,140
really intended to be something that's

44
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,550
very concise give you the flavor of

45
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,460
something new move on to the next thing

46
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,410
I hope you find it interesting and so

47
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:23,700
Brian if you would come up our first

48
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:27,960
speaker and I'll get your slides up okay

49
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,960
we all have you pressed your button yet

50
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,650
okay so on the left you see some users

51
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,880
on the right you see some services on

52
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,030
the objective of what we're talking

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,440
about here is to discuss a new way of

54
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,349
possibly connecting the users to

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,350
services I click - nothing happened

56
00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:03,460
thank you what anyway why entering the

57
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,860
IP service is no longer a safe

58
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,070
assumption in the internet they will

59
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,810
usually in middleboxes users want

60
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,740
specific services they don't want IP

61
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,570
addresses or URLs and I Spees want to

62
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:21,180
provide some services and they want to

63
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:30,219
redirect the user to other services that

64
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:31,720
was the wrong one so what use the

65
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,580
service type request turned on IP

66
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,740
address to forward packets at the

67
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,200
network edge we're not talking about the

68
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,240
core of the network abstract a service

69
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,789
as something called a service action

70
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,270
type which is a small integer indicating

71
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:49,150
the service is a very generic idea near

72
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,400
the user the packets are routed by the

73
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,370
service action type and not by the

74
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,679
address and of course before you ask the

75
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,870
obvious question right here each

76
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,180
one of the available services which is

77
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,410
how it turns out to work backwards so

78
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,930
here are some examples of service action

79
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,750
types reach ability on ipv6 reach

80
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,820
ability on ipv4 discovery service

81
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,289
computation service a storage service

82
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,550
and there's a list of others in the

83
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:21,940
draft packets are and the format derived

84
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,160
from ipv6 this is a low-level protocol

85
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,960
but there's a service action type

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,729
instead of a destination address because

87
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,650
users don't care about destination

88
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,570
addresses and there are other goodies

89
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,669
that look like a lair violation because

90
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,849
actually this thing is intentionally a

91
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:39,219
lair violation this entire code is

92
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,660
probably not worth looking at more

93
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,870
important there is a side meeting

94
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,610
discussion on Wednesday morning 8:30 not

95
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,039
in the church but in the room called not

96
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,539
read AM we're also discussing other

97
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:55,020
drafts that I'm going to talk about in

98
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:55,020
the second four minutes and I'm done

99
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:07,020
hello it's me again with the same with

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:11,680
the same co-authors this is a bit more

101
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,859
down-to-earth why are we talking about

102
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,650
this in edge deployments of IOT in

103
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,919
particular the physical MTU and the

104
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,409
bitrate Oh in some cases extremely low

105
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,698
that's well known so packet size matters

106
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:30,909
a lot he edge routers the edge routers

107
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,950
may be constrained themselves that has

108
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,479
an other implications besides the

109
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,760
problem of bandwidth and period header

110
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:44,169
decompression and header compression had

111
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,500
a decompression use resources 128 bit

112
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,600
addresses used memory so for a certain

113
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,910
class advertised there is a strong case

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,610
for both reducing packet size and

115
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,250
reducing the head of decompression and

116
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,730
compression overhead what why are you

117
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,010
doing by using shorter addresses

118
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,519
murti on the shorter addresses not

119
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,139
transmitting unnecessary bytes and

120
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,019
avoiding any fancy compression

121
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:18,959
decompression algorithms at the level of

122
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:21,209
processing the IP header how you define

123
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,279
an address length n within a domain wall

124
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:27,000
addresses within the domain or assumed

125
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,760
prefix in front of that of 128 - n bits

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,139
and there's lots of bit bytes and the

127
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,319
headers that you can get rid of if you

128
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:40,050
think about it and we use a flexible

129
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:42,149
header encoding octet to tell the lowest

130
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,010
layer of software how the header has

131
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,560
been encoded so you might end up with a

132
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,069
complete ID v6 header that consists of a

133
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,859
low length

134
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,870
NextEra hop limit and a truncated

135
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,959
destination address because it turns out

136
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,310
in the right conditions all the other

137
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,469
bits and pieces in the header aren't

138
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,469
actually any use and those are the bits

139
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,190
that you expect the this constraint

140
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,550
router to look at where six slow working

141
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:11,880
group tomorrow and same side meeting

142
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:21,990
discussion in Notre Dame on Wednesday

143
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:24,180
end before we go to our next speaker I

144
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,910
just want to let folks know that this

145
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,939
session is being streamed live and

146
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,459
there's going to be a video available on

147
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,170
YouTube so if you want to point somebody

148
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,219
to this there'll be YouTube coordinates

149
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,219
and usual slap

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,470
okay hello everyone today I'm

151
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:59,920
introducing a new technology called

152
00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:04,180
instant congestion assessment Network so

153
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,930
what's a main target problem first the

154
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,719
traffic in real networks especially

155
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,750
metro network is always heavily

156
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,010
unbalanced although we have ecmp or

157
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,740
using built such kind of technologies

158
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,650
surely they don't really work very well

159
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:29,020
and second the traffic is always

160
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:32,470
changing so fast and traditional traffic

161
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:37,660
engineering technology cannot adapt the

162
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:41,680
traffic in real-time so with the ICANN

163
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,370
technology we can provide guaranteed

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,640
never load-balanced in real-time

165
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:52,440
millisecond level and as well as SLA

166
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,750
assurance and high availability these

167
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:00,000
actually share the same core technology

168
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:03,550
but with different purposes and for the

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,170
use case one the network imbalance we

170
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:11,589
have already implement a prototype based

171
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:16,959
on commercial hardware router and

172
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:20,800
according to our test in laboratory the

173
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:25,570
whole network terpil could be increased

174
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:30,969
up to 30 percentage which is a

175
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:35,950
ridiculous resort and the PC principle

176
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:39,010
of the icon technology that we use the I

177
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:41,560
think controller to calculate multiple

178
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:45,340
paths between each pair of ingress and

179
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:50,199
egress router and after that the rotors

180
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:52,690
will by themselves adjust the flows

181
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,810
between the multiple paths based on the

182
00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:00,770
continuous measurement of the path

183
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:04,459
congestion seach situation this is done

184
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:10,760
in a very fast manner in millisecond

185
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:14,510
level so welcome to join the discussion

186
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:19,250
with more details in tears and RTG GG

187
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:21,920
and you can also check the backup slides

188
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,530
of this presentation and please feel

189
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:46,849
free to contact with me with any

190
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:50,870
questions thanks hi so Adam and Bob and

191
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,640
I are working with various international

192
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,410
standard setting bodies and government

193
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,810
agencies on a really critical problem go

194
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,969
next slide about yeah so it's just this

195
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,640
a small unmanned air vehicle can very

196
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,740
rapidly get close to a crowd or a piece

197
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,470
of critical infrastructure without being

198
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,660
observed on route and some public safety

199
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,580
person armed with only something that

200
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,380
he's likely to be carrying needs to be

201
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,330
able to quickly identify that thing is

202
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,120
it a friend is it a fall can we look up

203
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:22,160
its flight plan maybe can we establish

204
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,110
communications with its operator and

205
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,370
know for sure that it's the operator of

206
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,190
that aircraft that we're talking with

207
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,180
this problem of mapping a physical

208
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:34,910
location to a trustworthy identity seems

209
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,189
to me related to the identifier locator

210
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,839
split in the internet and where we're

211
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,470
trying to go between a logical location

212
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,810
and an identity and so we're looking at

213
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,610
the use of hip to do this and I'm gonna

214
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:52,160
let a hip expert take the rest of the

215
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:55,340
time speaking with us to an atom we've

216
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,010
worked out value of hits as the remote

217
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,230
ID for you ace it provides a trustworthy

218
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,990
identity to pair with physical and

219
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,060
logical location data as you know hits

220
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,920
our value ipv6 addresses can be used

221
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,449
directly over the broadcast of broadcast

222
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,680
media if that's what you're transmitting

223
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,249
like Bluetooth

224
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,888
Bluetooth the five is one of the thighs

225
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:18,829
for this with prove ownership using the

226
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:20,689
high for the signature for mobility and

227
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,998
multihoming so in case you're using

228
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:26,149
multiple files on this particular you a

229
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:28,430
would supported you can use the hip face

230
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:31,399
IPSec for secure communication if that's

231
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,888
what you desire need and we can come up

232
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,899
to a secure registration of the full

233
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:38,959
identity bootstrap on a first come first

234
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:43,309
owned for the ID that's what's available

235
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:45,050
there but it's not exactly what's needed

236
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,540
for this case there's some work needs to

237
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,149
be done the original design of hip

238
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,790
talked about hierarchal hits I've done a

239
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,180
draft on this since then and because of

240
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,170
ownership and other registry issues

241
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,628
hierarchal hits will definitely be a

242
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,699
value for this we need to have an

243
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:04,189
expanded registration process of what's

244
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:06,258
in the current on documents in terms of

245
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:08,329
a federated registrated registration

246
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:09,860
authorities to tying the various

247
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,319
metadata the actual physical location

248
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,839
and ownership and other information

249
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:18,589
about the device some of the new crypto

250
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,779
support which is out there taking

251
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:24,439
advantage of seaboard where we're

252
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:27,860
appropriate and since they keep on in

253
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:30,259
the work talking oh ah look at hip as a

254
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,180
whole off method that's we've seen so

255
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,540
far there will be other work to be

256
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,969
determined as we go through this process

257
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,879
but we feel that this is a very good fit

258
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:46,970
of technology and a requirement

259
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:48,800
situation and we have a sign meeting

260
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,639
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon during

261
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,269
the PM 3 time slot and it's in room C 2

262
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,709
for our side meeting and there's a

263
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:01,189
mailing list that's right things main

264
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:04,000
list TM - our ID at IETF core which is

265
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,000
just set up today

266
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,559
for the folks in the back there are a

267
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,119
few seats in the front and a few seats

268
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:26,359
over against the wall over there if you

269
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:32,178
are trying to get in hello Sharon from

270
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:34,610
mixer I wanna talk Sharon from mixer I

271
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:38,570
want to talk to you about a cool problem

272
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:42,439
and RFC draft that solves it it has to

273
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:46,309
do with the sharing of physical

274
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,490
information of a on the road between

275
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:51,590
cars and it makes use of grid of the

276
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:55,910
earth actually gonna go grid of the

277
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:58,939
earth called h3 and an overlay network

278
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:03,770
which can make those tiles of the earth

279
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:06,500
addressable cordless so just as a

280
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,330
background on the problem we distribute

281
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,820
hundreds or thousands of cameras each

282
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,760
week to drivers for them to drive around

283
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,600
they're paired with their phones they do

284
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,650
it because of insurance in motivations

285
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:26,000
and the insurers want them to do that

286
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:29,000
but as a result we actually have tens of

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,419
thousands of eyes crawling the physical

288
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,530
space and the public domain in every

289
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:38,840
major US city and because of the peering

290
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,000
to the phone it's not just cameras they

291
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,309
actually understand what they see with

292
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,590
the eye and they are connected using a

293
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:51,139
network so when we want all these

294
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,980
mobility client agents roaming the

295
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,900
streets to communicate what they see the

296
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,350
connected car industry had two options

297
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:03,620
for us one is the offline network tell

298
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:06,199
us about like a stop sign that fell or

299
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,979
started by a tree or construction zone

300
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,570
which is impaired made out of permit but

301
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,330
it doesn't tell you if that construction

302
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,450
cone is generating problems right now or

303
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:20,090
if that traffic sign is okay but the

304
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,260
traffic light is out right now

305
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:26,750
so there is a real-time Network option

306
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:31,220
mostly for safety and but that's a

307
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:33,680
peer-to-peer network so for example for

308
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,450
safety situations not for something that

309
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm about to hit right now but something

310
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,040
which let's say I'm driving a hundred

311
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,280
kilometers an hour to a pileup or to a

312
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,909
slowdown I'm turning a corner in a

313
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,490
junction in a city to a double parked

314
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,580
vehicle and our unloading vehicle a

315
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,770
tough situation for me to negotiate out

316
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,929
of and the course traffic sees it

317
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,139
clearly there's no clear way for me to

318
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,820
get that information if the car that the

319
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,830
last car just drove away three seconds

320
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,300
ago and won't get the information or may

321
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,310
get multiple and conflicting

322
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:12,050
informations from cars I don't know and

323
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:15,830
I don't want to know so the solution is

324
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:19,460
to pack up all these annotations as you

325
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:23,060
drive in and assign it to a tile that

326
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,430
tile as a ID based on the location in

327
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,030
the earth but also it's transit to an

328
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,760
eID

329
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:33,129
which is a lisp address which is now

330
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,129
make it something I can send packets to

331
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:41,000
this addressing scheme allows me to

332
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,340
share information between let's say

333
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,950
mobility car going here

334
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,949
mobility car going there this cars is

335
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,890
this guy cars future and vice versa

336
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,710
they can publish and subscribe to it in

337
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,590
tests we were able to communicate a red

338
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,550
light bridge another four milliseconds a

339
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,709
bit of a lab conditions between a camera

340
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:06,830
on the junctions and all the cars

341
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,810
approaching and affected by it so if

342
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:13,100
you're interested it's discussed in the

343
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:16,270
list working group tomorrow and happy to

344
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,270
have more participants

345
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,980
[Applause]

346
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,740
[Music]

347
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:37,320
hi I'm Ronnie Evan and on this car I'll

348
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,530
present the open congestion control

349
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:45,899
architecture with network operation for

350
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:49,620
our DMA fabric the motivation for this

351
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:52,170
work is for data center that they're

352
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,270
hiding speeds that are making network

353
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,180
transfer complete faster in fewer out it

354
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:59,250
is short data burst require low latency

355
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,740
while longer data transfer requires high

356
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,500
throughput so these are two requirement

357
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,810
there the our DNA is the common protocol

358
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,540
in data center network however the

359
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,820
congestion control is not optimized for

360
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,780
different user generated

361
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,850
interoperability allowing for

362
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,190
flexibility running an optimized

363
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,409
congestion method in the network

364
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,120
interface card in having fast congestion

365
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,270
notification to the sender can improve

366
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,520
the our DMA data trend transfer it's

367
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,230
common in a deficit of Network the TCP

368
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,520
traffic is mixed with the our DMA

369
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:37,740
traffic and the causes conflicts between

370
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,210
priorities between them and what we're

371
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,040
saying is there a better method that

372
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,140
could solve the problems mentioned above

373
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,420
while addressing interoperability so

374
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,640
that our DMA traffic can be treated it

375
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,350
more efficiently so we have two

376
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,050
documents on the open control

377
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,899
architectures the requirement document

378
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,610
and the architectural document there is

379
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,220
why not discuss the problems of the

380
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,530
country mode direct memory access fabric

381
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,000
congestion handling technology and the

382
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,090
requirement for better performance and

383
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,700
the architecture propose an open control

384
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,220
architecture of host networks for the

385
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,790
high-performance RDMA fabric to provide

386
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,580
better

387
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:19,740
congestion and the league for HPC and

388
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,870
distributed storage application the

389
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,150
architecture itself is seen in this

390
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:29,120
slide there are there's the sender

391
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,159
the reaction point in the receiver is

392
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,899
the notification point but the switch

393
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,700
can serve bosses the congestion point

394
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,159
but also is the congestion point but

395
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,020
also can provide notification so there's

396
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:44,419
can be a net to me control Channel and

397
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,830
of course they make to me control

398
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,929
channel that will provide the

399
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:52,779
information to allow the sender to

400
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:54,559
response better and faster so the design

401
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,539
configuration is provide better

402
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,690
information about the congestion stay

403
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:02,809
stay to the sender faster and more

404
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,850
accurate from the network and notify the

405
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:09,168
sender the reaction point from their

406
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,418
network support it can support proactive

407
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:13,909
response from the notification point and

408
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:16,039
support our DMA transport different to

409
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:17,929
our DJ transport so this what we are

410
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:21,770
talking about is something that would be

411
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:25,399
transport agnostic and support multiplex

412
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:28,129
the traffic of our DNA in TCP we did

413
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:31,668
some already some experimental tests and

414
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,940
we are having a side meeting on tomorrow

415
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:37,419
in Notre Dame room and of course if you

416
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:57,140
want to discuss it with me this is my

417
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:58,909
coordinates thank you I am Condon and if

418
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,380
we had coordinated better I probably

419
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,200
would have gone just before Ronnie

420
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,610
because this is very similar topic but

421
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,440
I'm kind of approaching it from a little

422
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,389
bit of a more higher level not a

423
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,630
specific solution Ronnie has some some

424
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:13,309
drafts that that describe that solution

425
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,929
someone talked about strat strategies to

426
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:17,480
dramatically improve congestion control

427
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:19,250
and high performance data centers so

428
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,080
first of all data center congestion is

429
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,059
different than the internet congestion I

430
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,549
think we all know that a few handful of

431
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:27,470
transactions can cause a lot coming in

432
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:29,570
from the web can cause a lot of activity

433
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,820
inside a data center so data centers

434
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,070
have much different environment there's

435
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,450
different bandwidth delay the switches

436
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,200
are implemented different and small

437
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,010
buffers high-speed links you know then

438
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,800
different Internet

439
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,170
routers there's a lot more homogeneity

440
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,889
in the network design it's not so random

441
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,800
the traffic is very concentrated servers

442
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,060
and storage are all in close proximity

443
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,620
and there's a lot of different the

444
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,409
traffic profiles are kind of well known

445
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,479
highly coordinated correlated and

446
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,190
typically they're managed with a lot

447
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,440
fewer people under a single management

448
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,240
domain so all this means that these data

449
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,650
center congestion the environment in

450
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,940
which it runs is much different than the

451
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,980
internet and we know we do internet

452
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,740
standards here but but we also do have

453
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,110
focused on data center standards DC TCP

454
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,230
as an example so the data center needs

455
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,639
low latency low overhead high efficiency

456
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,920
and high throughput so one thing the

457
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,570
data center kind of has in common with

458
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,180
the Internet is there's this trend to do

459
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,159
more over UDP something like we've seen

460
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,200
a lot of activity with quic for example

461
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,930
so what if we you know could do

462
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,590
something that that was more sort of

463
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,370
quick like but not quick you know as

464
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,889
heavy

465
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,290
perhaps for specific for the data center

466
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,330
and maybe we did something that was

467
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:46,970
Datagram congestion control like but

468
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,679
again focused on the congestion problems

469
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,770
of the Internet of the data center it

470
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,450
would need to be Hardware off loadable

471
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,670
but maybe with less emphasis on security

472
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,130
and crypto and all the threading kind of

473
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,380
stuff that things have it would need to

474
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:03,320
be really common congestion control as

475
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,480
described in the previous talk and

476
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,700
ideally we need to have the network

477
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,670
visibility marking and signaling

478
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,770
abilities from the network itself so the

479
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,750
ITF has this expertise so let's leverage

480
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,120
and not leave it to the UDP application

481
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,890
riders let's see if we can do something

482
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,409
we know datacenter congestion is

483
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,790
different the authors of these papers

484
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,100
have done a lot of work on congestion

485
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,810
trees so there's kind of two types you

486
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,030
know in network and in congestion and

487
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,190
it's constantly moving moving around in

488
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:35,540
cast or in network we've got solutions

489
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:37,850
today such as ecmp ecn even even in a

490
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,040
lossless environment ecn with priority

491
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,219
flow control all of these have various

492
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,590
pros and cons but they're not completely

493
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:50,090
addressing the the needs that we see so

494
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:53,090
some ideas of augmenting ecn with with a

495
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,870
data center focus for a UDP layer you

496
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,760
know

497
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,439
adding more feedback from the switches

498
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,410
in the packet headers perhaps you know

499
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,720
marking delay inside packets so that we

500
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,940
can get really fine grain view of what's

501
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,980
going on being able to figure out is

502
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,200
this congestion we're experiencing right

503
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,700
now is it in network or is it in caste

504
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,550
you know because maybe we would take

505
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,650
different approaches being able to speed

506
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,419
up notifications to the source so they

507
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,270
can quench you know in a way that

508
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,040
addresses it and then implementing fast

509
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,350
mechanisms in the switch to respond

510
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,240
immediately so so what like to do is

511
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,389
discuss the technical approach and

512
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,070
feasibility of these ideas in a side

513
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,660
meeting so we have a side meeting

514
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,250
tomorrow Notre Dame it's the same one

515
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,920
that was announced and we're also

516
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,050
providing remote participation for that

517
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,960
and then we're going to be requesting a

518
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,879
ETF mailing list as well so I think I

519
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,679
made it we also have a whole bunch of

520
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:53,480
references in this deck if you want to

521
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:54,890
read them thank you there's room on the

522
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:15,679
floor in the front if you guys want to

523
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:17,600
sit down so high I will presume to walk

524
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,970
showing but sure we can leverage an

525
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,520
existing networking agents to build

526
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,770
service from John Chang in most of her

527
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,480
existing deployment service functional

528
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,510
trains are controlled by a central

529
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,270
control point which computable ideal

530
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:36,350
placement of virtual functions such as

531
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:39,440
IDs firewall and prepare for M raising

532
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:41,629
some program since it creates failure

533
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,340
and the network scalability issues it's

534
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,400
oddly interoperable with resistant

535
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:50,500
networks and it under exploit existing

536
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:52,550
protocols or network for instance

537
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,470
service function training program is

538
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,440
mainly a routing program because you

539
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,120
have to route traffic for a set of white

540
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,690
bone between two before which medicine

541
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,610
ation so what her purpose is to augment

542
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,950
her entire entire gateway protocol and

543
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,100
make

544
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,830
a function aware you know in order to

545
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:14,519
build solution path I will quickly

546
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,678
remind how integral from functions you

547
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,620
have a gateway which are connecting

548
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,070
networks shank combination and building

549
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:28,289
a network view and based on what it a to

550
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:30,570
compute routing tables word for proposes

551
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:35,000
to bind some prefix through a specific

552
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:38,879
function such as first file an IDs

553
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,269
allowing to a useful waiting protocol to

554
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:46,950
would function through the total flow

555
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:53,399
through functions and to use any casings

556
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:55,710
to to do AGP matrix to select the

557
00:30:53,399 --> 00:31:01,168
functions and other consequence you have

558
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:03,000
a logical network view which is this one

559
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:06,269
where you have a for instance

560
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,600
pink nodes which represent for instance

561
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:15,419
a firewall and in the two instance on

562
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:17,610
the 200 tells will be will be different

563
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:21,269
based of so matrix rated for two to be

564
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,860
instance if you are interested in a walk

565
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:26,639
where we are doing you can come to a

566
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:28,678
conversation on Thursday and can discuss

567
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,510
about that and you can also find the

568
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,850
summer walk we have presented in

569
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:52,590
existing conferences if you want Thank

570
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:55,740
You Jeffrey from highways so the purpose

571
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,289
of this talk is to find the people she

572
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,960
had the same interests as with me too

573
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:04,980
about the theory behind the networking

574
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,580
so to clarify the terminology theory as

575
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:13,679
a system of ideas to explain based on

576
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:15,840
general principles so IDF is quite a

577
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,600
unique we have many contribution from

578
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,780
universities

579
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,730
and we even have research am i ah TF but

580
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:27,020
in my personal views there's a skill and

581
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:29,260
gap in our networking area as a whole so

582
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,600
our innovation and the design highly

583
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:35,570
rely on experience I don't find a

584
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,230
well-defined body of knowledge or a set

585
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:42,020
of approaches that can help us to make

586
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:45,620
design choice and understand the

587
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,960
trade-off behind those decisions so I'm

588
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,840
not the only one have this feeling so

589
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,480
these are very interesting paper from

590
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,530
Jennifer Luck's folder Princeton

591
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,809
Princeton University he/she coated the

592
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:03,740
some doubts from people inside and

593
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:06,590
outside networking community so is

594
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,640
networking a set of protocol acronyms or

595
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:13,520
a keep of head formats or we are just a

596
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,720
big a bunch of boxes of course Jennifer

597
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,760
defeated as though all these questions

598
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,720
elegantly but at the end of the paper

599
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,390
she also suggested that we can make the

600
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,169
question we ask more precise and the way

601
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:33,200
we answer them more rigorous and the

602
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:36,380
week maybe we can not so much value new

603
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,200
problems over deep answers to existing

604
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:41,059
questions we need to encourage more

605
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,039
seller and the complete and the deeper

606
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:49,280
research so why IDF so in one way this

607
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:52,600
theory can help IDF to explain and

608
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:56,690
predict the outcomes from new design and

609
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:00,740
facing your problems and also it can

610
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:04,159
help us for can help new generation to

611
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:08,359
inherit and make their own contributions

612
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,570
so on the other way why IDF or can can

613
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:14,119
help so we have both rich and very

614
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,250
successful experience and expertise in

615
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:20,359
theory we have so many academic

616
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:23,679
participants so why now now we are

617
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:25,850
facing some new requirements such as

618
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,310
deterministic and bounded Adelaide

619
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:31,350
services so we may require more

620
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:35,210
theoretical analysis than before so

621
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:38,580
is that the other is imposing IP is

622
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:41,820
proposed to apply Network calculus a

623
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:46,980
kind of queuing Theory to the time

624
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:49,230
sensitive networking problem so there

625
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:54,420
are several useful reference of course

626
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:57,360
this in one way is in one handiest and

627
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:00,090
mathematical foundations and tours and

628
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,250
on the other yes the theory of the Adhan

629
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:05,580
hope the seamen proposed a framework

630
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:07,290
long time ago I don't think I have time

631
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:11,370
to adjust the details but if you are

632
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:14,940
interested contact us me and my friend

633
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:19,699
can learn from China Mobile thank you

634
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,699
[Applause]

635
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:40,490
okay this is about software management

636
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,560
if you don't use these standards which

637
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,500
is really the entire software industry

638
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,910
outside networking so you you you know

639
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,010
every every company starts the same way

640
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,569
you write a little service we start

641
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,240
including more services to do your

642
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:55,579
function and then you learn about micro

643
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,009
services it becomes this and of course

644
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:00,319
you get this and of course you need a

645
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,810
management plan to to make sense of it

646
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:06,680
it's all so for each one of those little

647
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:09,140
boxes this is what you have to do today

648
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,480
you have to scrape log files to find out

649
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,549
if the Services is acting incorrectly

650
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,470
you have to write some tool to generate

651
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:19,069
config files deliver it balance the

652
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:23,149
service ok sorry thanks if it has a REST

653
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:24,619
API you have to integrate with that you

654
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,589
find performance metrics any which way

655
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,849
you can and if it has a security model

656
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:31,279
you got to somehow integrate with that

657
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:34,700
so every single service you have to do

658
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,140
this with and um if it looks like a lot

659
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,000
of work it is a lot of work but a lot of

660
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,500
companies are cheating because they're

661
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,780
finding recipes on the Internet to help

662
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,640
them get a jump start or they're only

663
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,260
mapping the pieces that they they think

664
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,060
they need before they go into deployment

665
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,680
and this is a problem because they find

666
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,259
out after deployment they forgot

667
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,319
something so clearly this is a lot of

668
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:57,500
work and the standards for yang Andres

669
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:59,750
conf solve this entirely but the

670
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,900
industry as a whole and to give you an

671
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,970
idea the scope of this problem puppet

672
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,010
labs they estimate there are now more

673
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,109
people in the management plane than

674
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,670
there are in the data plane so more

675
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,828
people writing software about software

676
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:16,010
than the software itself solving

677
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:19,760
problems so this is a very large problem

678
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:22,280
and so in 2015 I became aware of these

679
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,770
standards and wrote a implementation of

680
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,890
the the yang and the rest comp specs in

681
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:31,400
go I started there so I wrote a little

682
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:33,170
my first project was this bartender and

683
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,780
it has a Raspberry Pi and some relays

684
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:39,670
and some pumps and it's got a little

685
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:41,589
interface to make oh the animation work

686
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,839
so but I didn't put it all in

687
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:46,328
restaurants so there's a yang model for

688
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,410
the bartender and you can assign a pump

689
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:52,029
to a particular liquid and even when you

690
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:55,269
make your recipe you're going through a

691
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:56,740
rest conf and it was really no special

692
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:56,890
tools on the JavaScript to get this to

693
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,169
work

694
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,029
rest comp really is designed really well

695
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,880
to make it palatable to the industry as

696
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:06,940
a whole which is what his design was so

697
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,910
and I really like how rest comp has

698
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:13,180
different modules so if you know amazon

699
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,740
published a yang for alexa skill i could

700
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,519
add that in and all of a sudden you're

701
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,109
saying Alexa make me a mai tai so since

702
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,038
then I've used this in lots of different

703
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:25,680
industries IOT schools malware detection

704
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,769
the standards work really really well

705
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,419
but of course that's only so good so

706
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:33,249
when we've arrived is when I can tell

707
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,920
say Pedro duty which is a system for

708
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:37,899
alerting you to say hey postgrads when

709
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,730
there's a slow query paged me about it

710
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,289
and I didn't have to involve DevOps I

711
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,359
didn't have to program anything and this

712
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:45,190
is all possible with the standards but

713
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,180
none of these tools know about these

714
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:51,609
standards or implementing them so I'm

715
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,288
really here to talk about this this

716
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,538
problem in industry as a whole

717
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,749
see if this problem resonates with

718
00:38:55,539 --> 00:39:00,369
anybody I realized I tip is concerned

719
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:02,709
about networking but there's definitely

720
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,180
a bigger hole and I estimate this is

721
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,299
there there are actually 10 million

722
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,190
developers this could actually help them

723
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:11,410
out so and I'm one of those because

724
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,720
without these standards I find using

725
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,390
these standards in outside networking it

726
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,299
really doesn't doesn't really solve the

727
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,269
bigger problem so like I said if this is

728
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:24,460
resonates with you reach out to me

729
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:30,269
there's no working groups on this but

730
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,269
maybe next ITF there could um that's it

731
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:45,849
if the ITF is about anything it's about

732
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:47,828
making bringing my ties into schools hi

733
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,749
everyone I'm here to talk about like

734
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:51,670
aetherium improvement proposals and

735
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:54,910
there's no time for introduction for

736
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,470
just in jumping so as you may know or

737
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,480
may not a theorem is the second largest

738
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,368
cryptocurrency just based on the market

739
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,019
cap there is a possibly the number of

740
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,710
developers and tools that are based on

741
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:05,169
that

742
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:09,009
all right the first and hold blockchain

743
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:11,230
DLTS theorem is a home for en su sitio

744
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:13,869
naming services they trying to do that

745
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:17,650
Etha TLD and also do DNS SEC in the

746
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:19,150
blockchain also for IP FS or essential

747
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,609
file system applications there are a lot

748
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,200
of more apps there so I'm mostly

749
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:24,970
document looking processes here so

750
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,098
etherium is one of the healthiest

751
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,078
essential dev cycles within amongst the

752
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:31,239
blockchain and cryptocurrency projects

753
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,269
we see it far from the perfect from

754
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:35,609
perfect some of the circle and

755
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:37,118
challenges that essential

756
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:39,700
decentralization requires a

757
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,799
non-hierarchical in the Adamas cycle and

758
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,450
it's really hard so they have this e IP

759
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:46,029
which is in theorem improvement

760
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:48,038
proposals which was inspired by bitcoin

761
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:50,319
improve a proposal and that was inspired

762
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:52,630
by pet Python enhancement proposals

763
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,819
which that also was enjoyed by IETF

764
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,349
request for comment and there are some

765
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,609
aspects that we dropped on this path we

766
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:59,349
don't know where exactly but like

767
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:01,690
security consideration section on the IP

768
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:03,400
it's not there I'm really trying to put

769
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,549
add it back and it's gonna be added in

770
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,900
the next month probably so there is some

771
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,180
other process this is like the process

772
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,069
today I'm gonna go quickly on on these

773
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,410
and the slides are there for more

774
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:16,480
details so after discussing in the

775
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,970
forums and getting community support the

776
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,349
EIP author would add the CIP there so

777
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,930
security concession is missing there

778
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:24,910
we're trying to add it there and then

779
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,399
goes to a selected track so the track

780
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,529
the core track is actually the consensus

781
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,480
protocol and the protocol it's a really

782
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,180
critical one it has resulted in Forks in

783
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,769
the network and another controversy

784
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,960
there are some others that look ERC if

785
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:41,859
you have heard of tokens security tokens

786
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,390
CRC 20 they're all in this track and

787
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:45,430
there are some other things so the

788
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,379
process itself has like four you could

789
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:51,339
say five steps

790
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,490
so when it gets a community support it

791
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,500
gets the work-in-progress draft and

792
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:58,990
basically they write these usually major

793
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,850
major and if it's a quarry I peonies

794
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,890
implementation the miss you thought I

795
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:06,880
didn't talks about the proof of concept

796
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:09,069
after that it does in the IP number and

797
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,460
goes to a draft mode here the EAP author

798
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:15,010
would discuss and further make sure the

799
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,680
draft to have any way that actually

800
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:20,110
makes sense and it has some more support

801
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,149
and after that it goes to last call this

802
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:24,160
process every iteration takes more than

803
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,720
around two weeks and it's actually the

804
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,350
ends up with a call like a conference

805
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,000
call and so here mainly they talk about

806
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,920
if there are there are any security

807
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,870
implementations and that needed to be

808
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,020
checked your menu and test tests and

809
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:40,450
it's more on a non-official one and

810
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,340
after that if it's a courier pikas

811
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:44,109
accepted and all the clients at least

812
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,660
three of the clients there like four or

813
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:49,090
five ATM clients need to implement that

814
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,069
to get that actually in a final state if

815
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,230
it's not core then it sometimes is

816
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:55,540
standard it just goes to the public to

817
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,580
find out state so this is overall what i

818
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,560
just talked about and this is the first

819
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,180
attempt as far as we know to visualize

820
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,460
this and have something to show that

821
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,109
this is the process usually and still

822
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,950
even with this process it happens on

823
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,720
github proposals PR full request

824
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,189
everything happens there there's this

825
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,580
form if they're your magicians that

826
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:18,490
people discuss there and your magicians

827
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,319
there for the EIP magician and also this

828
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,729
is the call this is like a chord f call

829
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,120
that actually the decisions happened

830
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:29,200
there so why am I talking about this so

831
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:31,060
I've been involved in also write a

832
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,250
process we need that our ITF people to

833
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,009
find the gaps and missing pieces in this

834
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:37,930
and in this process and we find modules

835
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:41,680
I'm open to any discussions and comments

836
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:43,060
and this is how you can reach me and I

837
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,049
would be happy to talk about anything

838
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,049
but watching

839
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,190
[Applause]

840
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:08,359
hello everyone my name is Jim I'm from

841
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:12,020
Poway I'm here to discuss what's the

842
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,270
next step of young in I have actually a

843
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:18,440
little bit of background from me I used

844
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:22,310
to share so SM usm in office area who

845
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:26,000
deliver young be the model for era VP in

846
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:28,578
and actually we witnessed a young take

847
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,190
off and a phalaris ship but we still

848
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:34,550
feel there's some problem so that's why

849
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:36,530
I bring these topical here and so young

850
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:40,970
day tomorrow I'll get a lot of traction

851
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:45,730
actually operator began to plan to

852
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:48,828
employ a young bear model and but the

853
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:52,369
the reason for that actually young

854
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:54,890
actually not only happy to automate as a

855
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:58,880
networker but also allow operator to

856
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:01,368
peel the more agile service young

857
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,060
actually can model the service from the

858
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:06,589
top and also allow you to model the

859
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:10,069
collaboration operation of the device

860
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:11,810
allow you to configure the protocol on

861
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:14,480
the device get a net with set hopper so

862
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,940
usually the younger model you are

863
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,420
classified them into service layer model

864
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:22,369
and device level model but also in a

865
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,650
between we have resource level model

866
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:26,750
they allow you to schedule results to

867
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:32,180
meters as a service requirements from

868
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:34,940
the top and also allow you to to to to

869
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,450
program the networker actually make it

870
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,920
up to nine will change and so right now

871
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:44,270
in idea

872
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:49,130
more than 260 young they motor actually

873
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:53,690
has be developed in idea and more than

874
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:57,319
50 obviously and including a TA young

875
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:59,450
Ben Amato and we also see actually more

876
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:00,560
than 100 young did more working with

877
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,169
each other

878
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,410
proceeded in unite here so which have so

879
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:09,800
many young male model and but the the

880
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:12,500
the problem actually is you know we can

881
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,520
reference the integrity vendor in the

882
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:19,310
operated test report we can see actually

883
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,180
Medical has widely adopted it but for

884
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:24,799
younger the model still and early into a

885
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:31,640
adoption stage so what's the reason

886
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:33,830
behind so we see actually because many

887
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,830
operate actually you know not engaging

888
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,690
idea for this young data model

889
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:40,460
development actually for some operator

890
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,160
who already deployed these can

891
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,620
technology may not aware I developed

892
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:49,160
this young teen model even for the

893
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:51,770
operator who actually know what I am

894
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,279
doing but they don't know how how this

895
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:58,940
llamada put together to deliver a

896
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:04,010
service to fulfill the service actually

897
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:06,080
so there's a critical cat actually they

898
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:10,460
were leader the idea of young beta model

899
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:13,750
actually like a sufficient input from

900
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:17,240
the operator so to actually is actually

901
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,400
one of the approach a way proposed

902
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:24,560
actually we can define young they the

903
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:26,840
model framework actually to have

904
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,330
operator to how to indicate a younger

905
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:32,870
model in the same namespace and so we

906
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:35,660
have a chapter actually posted in OBS

907
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:40,310
authority that will be discussed in okay

908
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:42,440
say session on one Wednesday and try

909
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:46,990
this chapter actually we work together

910
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:50,300
with operators I try to fill this gap to

911
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:54,740
help right operator to provide such

912
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:57,470
guideline how to you know figure out how

913
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,589
even a layer model can put together and

914
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:04,040
in addition we we think you know

915
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:06,110
standard work is not enough for some of

916
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,779
these you may rely more coordination

917
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:25,480
between

918
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:30,340
okay okay I'm full hon Baker and this is

919
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:33,370
the mathematical mesh oh so internet

920
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,800
security is broken it's broken because

921
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,230
users are finding security it's just too

922
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,990
much effort and you can't solve that by

923
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,120
asking them to try harder it's broken

924
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,100
because applications are not solving the

925
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,740
real problem I mean like looking at all

926
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:50,860
the data breaches the data at rest

927
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,589
breaches we mostly focus on transport

928
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,650
and we've not actually changed our

929
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:59,260
approach very much since the pgpr days

930
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:02,110
and the pam days we're still using the

931
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:05,680
same tool box and we're still using the

932
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:07,830
same limited number of operations so the

933
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,390
most address is three core problems

934
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:12,779
device management so you can glue all

935
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:16,450
your devices together so they're worn

936
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,820
gestalt contact management so you can

937
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,100
connect all the people that you connect

938
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,800
to together and have access to all their

939
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,740
public keys on all your devices and a

940
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:29,440
secure control plane messaging which is

941
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:34,060
end-to-end secure and traffic analysis

942
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:37,510
resistant Oh wrong so it's based on the

943
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:40,410
principle of I'm using more advanced

944
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:43,480
cryptography than in Bruce Schneier book

945
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:45,520
one key cryptography is great des you

946
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,890
know you can do a lot with this but two

947
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,360
key is better because you can separate

948
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,750
out the roles of encryption and

949
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:58,900
decryption if one is good and two is

950
00:49:52,750 --> 00:50:02,050
better why don't we try three four five

951
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,850
separate the roles out more and we can

952
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:09,180
do more cryptography and more

953
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:11,620
cryptography means more security yes

954
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:15,460
there's a bunch of small powerful

955
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,600
concepts here I can't go through these

956
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,820
at all

957
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,790
but basically there's five basic

958
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,050
technologies here and it's a grab-bag

959
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:25,180
and they're all designed to work

960
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,850
together but you can also use them a la

961
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:30,669
carte in your projects going to be

962
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:35,920
talking about this at sex dispatched

963
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:39,910
tomorrow at 1:30 and this is the wrong

964
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,550
set of slides it seems a she sent in I'm

965
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:45,250
about to start releasing this so if

966
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,560
you've got strong opinions on it please

967
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:50,410
talk to me before I release it because

968
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:53,020
the minute I have users I'm going to

969
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,520
start protecting legacy encode if you

970
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,910
want to change anything

971
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:00,040
tilt before I release the code there's a

972
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:01,690
whole bunch of drafts and the drafts are

973
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,390
based on running code that comes from

974
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:07,060
the reference library it's all in MIT

975
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:09,430
license or C sharp or that good sir and

976
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:12,040
the objective here is to provide people

977
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:15,009
with kind of like a psychic learn for

978
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:17,590
cryptography if you look at the advanced

979
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:21,340
in AI that's happened over the past ten

980
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:24,610
years that happened after the AI people

981
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,160
made it really easy for people to add AI

982
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:30,310
into application with things like pandas

983
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,960
and scikit-learn so the reference codes

984
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,000
and attempt to do that's the same thing

985
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,320
for cryptography and you've got all the

986
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,760
same goodness of blockchain pkcs7 PGP

987
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:45,550
x.509 and so on but in a much smaller

988
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,640
library because if you make all the

989
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:51,100
systems use a same unified approach you

990
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,509
can get rid of a lot of code I've got

991
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:56,890
rid of two-thirds of the code over the

992
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:58,750
past two years so meetup so we will talk

993
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,700
about sex dispatch tomorrow at 1:30

994
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:08,950
please be there or talk to me afterwards

995
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:10,629
thank you I'll upload oh and there's

996
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:14,399
also going to be podcast explaining each

997
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,400
part of this on the web

998
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,680
I'm either Luba chef and I really want

999
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:32,619
to talk to you about law packet loss

1000
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,330
detection in encrypted protocols I'm

1001
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:39,849
looking at quick alright I'm a transport

1002
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:42,940
guy I love to think of my networks as

1003
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:44,800
just dump pipes but really for them to

1004
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,260
be a dump pipes there could be somebody

1005
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,970
inside that pipe who is looking for

1006
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:57,400
leaks and can find and page them quickly

1007
00:52:50,970 --> 00:53:00,189
if it's senior TCP flow in the pipe it's

1008
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,950
pretty good she can look at sequence

1009
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,930
numbers at numbers figure out if there

1010
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:08,230
is leak see it if it's upstream

1011
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:13,060
downstream if she is looking at a quick

1012
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:15,520
slow not as good there is no really no

1013
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,700
bids to look at to see if the respect at

1014
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:23,290
loss so it's a I think it's a problem

1015
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:29,080
and there is a propose a solution that

1016
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:33,369
uses two bit 1 bit is a cube it stands

1017
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:37,029
for square signal it's very simple sand

1018
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:42,190
that's an essence 64 when you send in

1019
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:46,210
packet 64 of them come zero cubed 64 one

1020
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:49,869
64 0 so forth the other packet the other

1021
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:53,950
surahs are bit is an else for loss event

1022
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:56,349
a bit and it is set when there's a

1023
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:59,348
special unreported loss counter which is

1024
00:53:56,349 --> 00:54:02,980
greater than zero and unreported loss

1025
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:05,349
counter is maintained by the sender when

1026
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:07,780
there is a packet that the sender sent

1027
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:09,580
and the Penn center deems it lost it

1028
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,130
increments the counter when the packet

1029
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,710
with l1 is sent the counter is

1030
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:17,320
decremented so if you can see the

1031
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:21,010
picture there are two packets in red

1032
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,680
they've been lost about one or TT to one

1033
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:27,010
or two or later sender determined

1034
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:30,460
they've been lost and it sent two

1035
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:32,350
packets with l1 okay how can we use that

1036
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,020
how is it useful

1037
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:37,569
so end-to-end loss is pretty simple it's

1038
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:40,420
just a fraction of packets with l equals

1039
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:44,350
one bits that absorber observed

1040
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:47,140
upstream loss is basically how many bits

1041
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:49,870
with a particular Q value are missing

1042
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,600
from a block once you have downstream

1043
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,520
and upstream loss you can figure out

1044
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,259
when you once you have end-to-end and

1045
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:01,570
upstream loss you can figure out the

1046
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:03,610
downstream loss pretty cool so it's cool

1047
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:08,080
in theory but we decided to test it in

1048
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:11,230
practice Akamai's implemented a scheme

1049
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:13,830
based on this in our deployed servers

1050
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,750
and we've been serving quick traffic to

1051
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:19,750
some orange and users in a number of

1052
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:23,020
countries for for some time and there is

1053
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:27,100
data for it actually real world data not

1054
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:31,480
simulator or anything else and plenty

1055
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:33,190
and if you are interested I hope you are

1056
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,380
but if you're interested if you're an

1057
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:39,490
operator or have thoughts about it

1058
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:43,630
please see us will be a here Monday

1059
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:48,720
tomorrow 8:30 to 9:30 for a side meeting

1060
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:51,600
and we'll talk about it in TS vwg on

1061
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:55,620
Thursday that's going to be focused on

1062
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:59,560
protocol details as well as privacy and

1063
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:02,350
ossification risk and then on Friday

1064
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:05,230
onmyoji will actually present lots and

1065
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:06,910
lots of data and talk about it and of

1066
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:09,180
course you can talk to us

1067
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:11,089
Thanks

Rodney

1071
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:41,209
I'm broadened I want to talk about zero

1072
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,150
is not must be zero

1073
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:46,069
reserve does not must be zero we all

1074
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,440
know about these common words that are

1075
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:50,509
used throughout our RFC's there's a word

1076
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,819
I'd like to add to that list and that's

1077
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:56,989
the word reserved because it is

1078
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:58,910
interpreted differently at times it's

1079
00:56:56,989 --> 00:57:02,180
pretty frequently used it's poorly

1080
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:04,848
documented there's different ideas of

1081
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:08,198
exactly what it means and how it's used

1082
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:13,279
depending on in what context it's used

1083
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:15,709
this is is become a problem when it's

1084
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:18,799
when when reserved is treated this must

1085
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:20,359
be zero by a receiver and some future

1086
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,670
thing has come along and go that's not

1087
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:24,859
reserved anymore I want to use that for

1088
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,449
something else and somebody goes nope

1089
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:28,880
that must be zero we're gonna throw that

1090
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:30,499
packet away it's no good

1091
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,609
we're repeatedly running into this

1092
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:37,368
problem in protocol implementations in

1093
00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:40,130
software and almost anything that uses

1094
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:43,219
the word reserved so I'm basically

1095
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:45,589
trying to bring the idea that we might

1096
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:47,539
want to clearly define this thoroughly

1097
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:49,578
define the different contexts that it

1098
00:57:47,539 --> 00:57:55,249
can be used in and what it means in

1099
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:57,440
those contexts if they're this is this

1100
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:59,779
is gonna be a one-minute talk if there's

1101
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,910
any future discussion if people want to

1102
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:04,069
try and talk about let's codify this

1103
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:06,140
let's make an RFC out of it I'm

1104
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:09,558
available I'll be here all week there's

1105
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,879
my email address I've got a couple

1106
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:14,769
minutes if anybody wants to throw

1107
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,769
anything out about it right now we can

1108
00:58:16,209 --> 00:58:20,899
do it do I hear you can I hear a second

1109
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:23,839
on that motion should we should I start

1110
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,410
a draft okay that's what I wanted to

1111
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,410
hear thank you

1112
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:58,910
Oh hit one enter first lightly hello

1113
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:02,080
everyone my name is Stuart Cheshire and

1114
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:04,819
some of you may know I'm the creator of

1115
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,620
zero configuration networking and dinner

1116
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:09,200
service discovery and what Apple calls

1117
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:11,630
Bonjour I'm sure everybody knows it's

1118
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,819
used widely and Apple products what a

1119
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,500
lot of people don't realize is it's now

1120
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,170
in most Linux distributions

1121
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,870
it's used by chromecast it's on Android

1122
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:27,590
and it's starting Windows 10 it's even

1123
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:29,870
in Microsoft Windows anywhere in your

1124
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:32,240
software that you have somewhere for a

1125
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:34,130
user to type in an IP address or a host

1126
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,770
name you can use DNS service discovery

1127
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,590
to give them a list of options to choose

1128
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:41,900
from instead if you have iPhones here

1129
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,670
you can tap on AirPrint and you pick the

1130
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,880
printer you want there's no where to

1131
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:49,010
type an IP address if the thing you want

1132
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,140
doesn't show up you fix that by fixing

1133
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:53,110
the network not by typing in IP

1134
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:55,129
addresses on the client devices

1135
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:57,860
traditionally this is used peer-to-peer

1136
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:00,380
multicast what's great about that is it

1137
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,360
requires no infrastructure you just hook

1138
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,330
up two laptops with an Ethernet cable no

1139
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,550
switch they can discover each other two

1140
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,560
phones using peer-to-peer Wi-Fi no

1141
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,260
access points they can discover each

1142
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:14,810
other services that's great for small

1143
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,390
networks but it's inefficient on large

1144
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:18,920
networks because it impacts every device

1145
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:21,710
on the network even the ones you're not

1146
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:24,020
talking to you right now it's slow on

1147
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,210
Wi-Fi because multicast is sent to low

1148
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,460
rate and multicast SAR batched with the

1149
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:31,570
beacon so there's high latency it's

1150
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:33,650
wasteful of shared wireless spectrum and

1151
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:35,000
it's unreliable because it's not

1152
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:37,100
acknowledged so you have to retransmit

1153
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,680
which makes it even more wasteful of

1154
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:42,700
that precious wireless spectrum with

1155
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,700
these slow transmissions

1156
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:49,249
so we want to discover things that are

1157
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:52,129
multiple hops away without flooding the

1158
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:53,089
multicast and if you do this with your

1159
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,640
iPhone today

1160
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:58,069
you send a multicast but the printers

1161
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:02,569
not nearby we solve that by adding a

1162
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:05,479
Discovery proxy your device now makes a

1163
01:01:02,569 --> 01:01:07,308
TCP connection by sending IP packets

1164
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:09,769
multiple hops through that network

1165
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:12,319
the discovery proxy can then do the

1166
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:14,959
multicast on your behalf and send the

1167
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,729
answer back you discover the printer you

1168
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:20,509
can now make an end-to-end TCP

1169
01:01:16,729 --> 01:01:21,649
connection and use that we'd love you to

1170
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:24,499
get involved

1171
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:27,650
you can join the DNS SD mailing list you

1172
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:32,328
can check out the code from the IETF

1173
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:35,660
hackathon we have an open wrt package

1174
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:37,430
for this little open wrt router in about

1175
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:39,200
five minutes you can add a discovery

1176
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:41,390
proxy to this and have one running on

1177
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,129
your own home network we'll be showing

1178
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:45,618
this at the hack demo happy hour

1179
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:46,910
tomorrow just a cross over there so you

1180
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,819
can come and see it working for yourself

1181
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:53,499
and of course come to our DNS SD work

1182
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:53,499
group meeting on Thursday thank you

1183
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:16,839
shooting from Maui today I'm going to

1184
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:23,180
introduce you one of our new work is a

1185
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:26,538
application-aware ipv6 networking so

1186
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:29,660
first about the motivation I seen

1187
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:32,269
tonight he involves we could say we have

1188
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:34,759
already experienced IP the first

1189
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:37,308
generation but they are still some

1190
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:40,219
challenges for example the isolated the

1191
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:44,059
networked islands of the limited program

1192
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:47,239
program programmability and most

1193
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:50,299
importantly and the network is still on

1194
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:54,680
its own and the application and the

1195
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:58,640
network are isolated at the carpet and

1196
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:02,029
now we have SRA six we could say we are

1197
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:05,328
entering a new generation YP the second

1198
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:09,769
generation and I sorry six has its own

1199
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:13,849
mission and first it is a based on ipv6

1200
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:16,819
so it has the affinity to IP so it could

1201
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:20,930
be much easier to integrate the network

1202
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:24,220
domains and also it has the programmer

1203
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:27,230
ability so it has the programmer

1204
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:29,598
programmable fields so you could convey

1205
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:32,779
more information from the applications

1206
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,819
to the network so in that case you could

1207
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:38,390
integrate the application and the

1208
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:43,279
network make them to work together so

1209
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:46,308
here are the ipv6 extension hiders we

1210
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:48,470
have the hop by hop and destination

1211
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:51,710
options hiders and also the routing

1212
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:54,410
header i sorry choose one of this so we

1213
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:57,079
have the arguments fields and also that

1214
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:59,269
he are we you we could use to convey

1215
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:03,339
some information from the applications

1216
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:06,589
and that are the foundations for the

1217
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:11,180
application aware ipv6 all eyes are

1218
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:14,119
basics networking we call it AP + 6 so

1219
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:18,230
basically we are actually make use of

1220
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:21,019
the ipv6 extension hiders to convey some

1221
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:23,890
informations from the applications into

1222
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:29,180
the network so the network could make

1223
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:32,150
the fine granular traffic operations to

1224
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:35,029
do the for example the resort network

1225
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:38,450
resource assessment to guarantee the SLA

1226
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:42,380
so it could be applied to for example

1227
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:45,230
the fixed mobile broadband like the -

1228
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:48,980
b2c scenarios and also the mobile

1229
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:51,559
broadband and for the solution side we

1230
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:53,809
could have the host decide solution that

1231
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:58,009
is the application directly put the

1232
01:04:53,809 --> 01:05:00,559
information into the ipv6 hiders all it

1233
01:04:58,009 --> 01:05:03,140
could be the network side solutions that

1234
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:05,509
is the network edge could attack the

1235
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:07,848
application and provide the information

1236
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:09,150
about the application and can wing it

1237
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:14,160
into the

1238
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:17,130
and we are we are going to have a side

1239
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,580
meeting on Thursday Thursday morning and

1240
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:24,390
we have the agenda you could refer refer

1241
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:28,000
the related drafts we listed in the side

1242
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:33,839
meeting wiki okay thank you

1243
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,840
[Applause]

1244
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:35,880
we're on the backup USB stick I don't

1245
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:37,140
know why sorry ok yep great my name is

1246
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,080
Joseph Potvin I'm the executive director

1247
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:41,790
for Excel rhythms foundation some

1248
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,740
colleagues and I have initiated a

1249
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:45,480
project called an internet of rules I'll

1250
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,890
say right away if you think it's a

1251
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,630
terrible name that we should not be

1252
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,750
calling what we're doing that please let

1253
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:53,760
us know I'll restrict this to the why

1254
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:56,430
and the what of what we're doing I could

1255
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,800
explain how there's running code behind

1256
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:00,720
this we're doing alpha testing right now

1257
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,120
but I've had a very interesting

1258
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,759
conversation over the last two days as

1259
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,440
part of the hackathon and there's lots

1260
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:12,660
of different ideas about and good ideas

1261
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:14,640
about how to do this next so very happy

1262
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:17,850
to see what Rodney was talking about a

1263
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:20,779
few sessions here ago we're actually

1264
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:23,880
working on the generalization of how

1265
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:26,100
words like must must not required shell

1266
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:28,350
and so forth actually get deployed so if

1267
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,120
you can imagine any IOT implementation

1268
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,830
and let's say there's some Court

1269
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:35,580
decision in some province or state and

1270
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:38,009
that's gonna affect privacy rules in

1271
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:41,160
terms of how data moves around from in

1272
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:42,720
to all sorts of IOT devices exactly how

1273
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,339
is that new rule going to get deployed

1274
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,109
you can even say how it's going to get

1275
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,600
deployed through the equipment providers

1276
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:51,330
how is even that rule expressed and say

1277
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:54,990
English or or Spanish going to get

1278
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:56,160
deployed to the 45,000 suppliers of

1279
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:58,709
these IOT devices

1280
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:02,069
this affects issues in money finance

1281
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:03,840
Commerce Tax international trade machine

1282
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:07,050
control systems internet-based

1283
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:09,510
networking whatever it is the gap in

1284
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:11,310
this space is so huge it's hard to see

1285
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:12,540
so it's hard to communicate this

1286
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,980
sometimes because most people are

1287
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:18,210
looking for little gaps this is an

1288
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:20,310
enormous gap next so the problem is

1289
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:22,439
enormous Lee wasteful error-prone

1290
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:24,690
redundancy

1291
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,488
each of you who is not from Canada when

1292
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:28,858
you pay your hotel bill right now you're

1293
01:08:26,488 --> 01:08:30,629
actually supposed to be zero rated on

1294
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:33,210
the value-added tax but you're going to

1295
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:34,710
pay it and if you were to try to claim

1296
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:36,960
it back on the way out

1297
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:39,779
good luck to you little rules like that

1298
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,630
come in and they were just simply not

1299
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:44,520
deployable today that's tax but any of

1300
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:47,069
these other domains you have the same

1301
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,630
kind of problem it requires a

1302
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:50,609
domain-specific language which we've

1303
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,080
prototyped right now and not prototype

1304
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:55,500
we've actually implemented an alpha and

1305
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,689
an optimized algorithm search we're not

1306
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:01,198
dealing with if-then statements we're

1307
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:04,290
dealing with given X facts con has a

1308
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:06,870
context when there's an input fact for a

1309
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:10,399
circumstance then Zed ought to be the

1310
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:13,639
case so these are just three facts next

1311
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:17,189
the actual software we have deployed

1312
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:19,739
begins by interacting with an API

1313
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:21,988
there's a small component piece and

1314
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:23,339
auxiliary piece called lichen you can

1315
01:09:21,988 --> 01:09:24,899
use it or not use it it's a it's a

1316
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:27,089
reference implementation create your own

1317
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:29,309
if you like roll your own that provides

1318
01:09:27,089 --> 01:09:32,250
the context FAQ and the input info fact

1319
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:34,969
up to the server in the server is a

1320
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:38,509
distributed

1321
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:40,830
set of servers with the collection of

1322
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:44,389
algorithms which implement the rules and

1323
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:49,170
these algorithms are simple declarative

1324
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:51,839
tabular or tuple oriented programs we

1325
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:53,819
deliver those back as output facts we do

1326
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:55,920
not inject them we stop at the point of

1327
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:57,300
delivering back the fact there that

1328
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,260
there is a rule and here's what it is

1329
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:03,690
and next place so excel go that

1330
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:05,400
domain-specific language it's think of

1331
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:08,610
programming in terms of control tables

1332
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:11,699
decision tables and so forth with a few

1333
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:14,339
reserved words very very minimalist it's

1334
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:16,259
deliberately not turing-complete and it

1335
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,960
uses all any standard schema when it

1336
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:22,469
comes to identifying what industry it is

1337
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,230
what what jurisdiction it is what

1338
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:31,380
product type it is next please

1339
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:33,349
intro Libre sorry notice I okay that's

1340
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,219
the search engine and then next slide

1341
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:38,489
I'm presenting in this room on Tuesday

1342
01:10:36,219 --> 01:10:38,489
thirty

1343
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:45,188
[Applause]

1344
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,350
[Music]

1345
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,239
working again

1346
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:25,370
hi so I'm gonna talk a little bit about

1347
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:26,990
multiple provisioning domains a term

1348
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:29,570
that you've probably heard and maybe

1349
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:32,420
know what it means but I think a lot of

1350
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:34,790
people don't so hence the talk so the

1351
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:36,680
point of this is back in the 1990s you

1352
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:38,570
had a host it was probably sitting on

1353
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,640
your desk it's connected to a network it

1354
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,929
got DNS and IP addresses somehow from

1355
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,700
the network and everything just worked

1356
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:49,820
that was great good times times have

1357
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,990
changed and so recently and you know

1358
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,840
certainly in the 20 teens and even

1359
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:55,070
before that it was not uncommon to have

1360
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,970
a host connected to more than one

1361
01:11:55,070 --> 01:12:01,219
network typical scenarios VPN is a

1362
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:04,730
classic typical scenario but a less well

1363
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:06,530
less well understood scenario is when

1364
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:08,150
you have a host is connected say a phone

1365
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:13,009
for example that's connected to your

1366
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:14,990
cell service provider and to a wireless

1367
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:16,790
network which may have a captive portal

1368
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:18,260
on it you don't want your network

1369
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,690
service to suddenly stop because your

1370
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:23,210
connection to the captive portal network

1371
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:24,650
so things get a little more complicated

1372
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:31,540
when you have to deal with use cases

1373
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:31,540
like this that's a typo but anyway so

1374
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:40,460
anyway so so the host so if a host looks

1375
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:42,100
up a service using using using the DNS

1376
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:45,620
server that it got from from network a

1377
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:48,470
it is and then tries to use the answer

1378
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:50,090
it got on network B if that service is

1379
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:52,910
actually only reachable on network a

1380
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:55,040
it's gonna fail so we need to be able to

1381
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,960
associate networks we need to be able to

1382
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:02,390
associate things like DNS servers and IP

1383
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:05,240
prefixes together and of course in the

1384
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:06,980
2020s things are even more exciting this

1385
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:10,309
is starting now but but you know you can

1386
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:13,179
see there there are routers that you can

1387
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:17,270
buy that have both a connector for your

1388
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:19,310
ISP and also a cellular backup and you'd

1389
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:21,500
like that to be able to work and you

1390
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:23,330
also like your devices on the home

1391
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:27,170
network to be able to distinguish

1392
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:31,190
between the two providers so how do you

1393
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:32,130
do that the answer is with provisioning

1394
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,719
domains

1395
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,950
the provisioning domain is a connect

1396
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,720
collection of configuration information

1397
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:40,470
that's known to have come from the same

1398
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,230
source so in the previous example where

1399
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:44,040
we had network a and network B

1400
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:46,440
networking and network B were both

1401
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,050
different provisioning domains and

1402
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,759
similarly in the 2020s example where

1403
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,080
we've got provider a and provider B

1404
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,010
those are both also different

1405
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:57,600
provisioning domains so how do we

1406
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:01,470
communicate with this to the hosts in

1407
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,000
the 2010s usually we would just notice

1408
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:04,350
that we had two network interfaces and

1409
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,210
so we would be able to set up an ad-hoc

1410
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:08,990
provisioning domain we would just assume

1411
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:12,450
that information that we got on

1412
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:13,650
interface a and interface information

1413
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:15,990
that we've got an interface B are not

1414
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:17,809
interchangeable and and we would just do

1415
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:21,450
that automatically without being told

1416
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:23,550
that doesn't work so well if you have a

1417
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:24,720
border router and you're behind the

1418
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,850
border router and the border router is

1419
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,200
connected to two different homes so in

1420
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:31,620
that case we need something called an

1421
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:34,800
explicit for visiting domain and so work

1422
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:36,390
has been going on in the ITF recently to

1423
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:40,980
make explicit provisioning domains

1424
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:42,390
happen so the original work was done in

1425
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,490
the myth working group we produced a

1426
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:46,560
document called the multiple multiple

1427
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:48,000
provisioning domain architecture which

1428
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,350
explained the problem that I just

1429
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,860
explained to you in quite a bit more

1430
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:57,380
detail and more accuracy but didn't

1431
01:14:52,860 --> 01:15:00,089
actually solve it and then just recently

1432
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:01,650
a number of folks in the interior

1433
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:04,050
working group been working on a document

1434
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:05,820
called draft and area providing domains

1435
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:08,340
discovering provisioning domain names

1436
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:12,299
and data so this is using an RA option

1437
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:14,100
to explicitly state that this prefix and

1438
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,200
all the information about this prefix is

1439
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:20,400
in its own provisioning domain which has

1440
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:22,860
this name and so that work is almost

1441
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,210
done I'm mostly telling you about this

1442
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:27,920
because I think it's really useful and

1443
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:30,999
you want to know please come to inter

1444
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,999
[Applause]

1445
01:15:38,350 --> 01:16:04,340
Spencer so Spencer Dawkins and talking a

1446
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:07,850
little bit about performance implication

1447
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:09,860
of path characteristics this is a Rube

1448
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:11,570
Goldberg machine which actually turns

1449
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,610
out to be a pretty good implementation

1450
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:18,170
of what I think a lot of their work

1451
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:23,269
paths look like these days so how we got

1452
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:27,250
here we did a follow on to the tcp over

1453
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:30,170
satellite working group in 1997 to 2000

1454
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:33,350
talking about very long RTT interaction

1455
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:35,750
with slow loss recovery we I brought a

1456
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:38,750
proposal for a TCP over cellular to the

1457
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:41,840
IETF and the ad suggestive structured

1458
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:45,380
approach instead of doing TCP over food

1459
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:49,850
links Aaron and I co-chaired the pilk

1460
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:51,740
working group 1999 to 2004 and we had

1461
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:59,030
specific recommendations that we issued

1462
01:16:51,740 --> 01:17:01,940
as BCPs most of them for specific link

1463
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:06,230
characteristics and that was adopted

1464
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:08,570
actually by web form version 2 of life

1465
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:12,559
was good for a while things have

1466
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:14,860
probably changed since 2004 a lot of

1467
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,120
stuff is on here there's actually

1468
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:19,700
probably more things that have changed

1469
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:22,099
that then I didn't put on the slide

1470
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:24,889
things like CD ends and stuff like that

1471
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,350
but you know it's been going on ever

1472
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:29,180
just to pick one of them well weren't

1473
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:32,439
thinking about multipath at all we were

1474
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:38,999
thrilled we could get one path to work

1475
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:43,650
so I'd like to do at ITF 105 we had a

1476
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:46,539
excited meeting and went out at ITF 104

1477
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:48,669
in the coat lounge and that was helpful

1478
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:51,880
so I was going to another one of those

1479
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:55,439
meetings but I've also been told I could

1480
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:57,400
have been the Panaji research group and

1481
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:58,809
they've been thinking about petha were

1482
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,688
now working I'd like to talk to them

1483
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:03,989
about what is engineering and what is

1484
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:03,989
research

1485
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:10,268
so what's ready for the ITF to make

1486
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:12,360
recommendations for and what's not ready

1487
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:14,530
for the ITF to make recommendations for

1488
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:18,699
independent this that wimpy no chance

1489
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:20,768
meeting the thing so like I say the

1490
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:22,629
thing I'm saying here that I need to

1491
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:26,919
make pretty clear is that I'm talking

1492
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:30,159
about I'm talking about producing BCPs

1493
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:32,289
for protocol designers because we still

1494
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:34,539
get a lot of product we still get a lot

1495
01:18:32,289 --> 01:18:38,110
of proposals from people who are trying

1496
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:41,380
to solve specific problems with

1497
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:43,900
well-meaning ideas that the transport

1498
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:46,869
community has identified problems with a

1499
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:50,709
long time ago but we never write those

1500
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:54,728
things down my favorite one was you know

1501
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:57,789
if you read my PhD dissertation from 10

1502
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:59,829
years ago with it you would clearly say

1503
01:18:57,789 --> 01:19:02,320
that and that was the best route that

1504
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:04,719
was the best recommendation we had I

1505
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,630
think the ITF has done better in the

1506
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:09,659
past I think we could do better hope to

1507
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:13,169
see you on Wednesday morning and

1508
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:13,169
Thursday afternoon

1509
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:21,119
so for those of you not keeping track

1510
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,409
we're down to the last three talks if

1511
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:23,880
you're thinking about dinner maybe a

1512
01:19:22,409 --> 01:19:25,379
little bit hungry we should be out of

1513
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:29,489
here in about 15 minutes so you can

1514
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:33,710
start making your plans but our next

1515
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:33,709
speaker is use out to talk about loops

1516
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:44,039
only have a single page yeah yeah so we

1517
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:45,960
should we should finish with much lesser

1518
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:49,559
than 50 minutes I only have a single

1519
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:52,199
page here and I'm gonna give a simple

1520
01:19:49,559 --> 01:19:55,440
okay announcement on the loops path

1521
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:59,549
because this is one of the very first

1522
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:02,579
sessions of ITF so I want you guys who

1523
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:05,969
were possibly just here and with your

1524
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:08,940
jetlag aware that this time the session

1525
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:11,429
starts from 10 okay so tomorrow morning

1526
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:14,159
10 o'clock we are going to have debuff

1527
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:18,420
loops which stands for the local

1528
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:21,058
optimization on path segments okay

1529
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:22,889
the pet okay give a very simple

1530
01:20:21,059 --> 01:20:25,949
description the path of a long-haul

1531
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:29,280
Network can be naturally or purposely

1532
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:32,098
partitioned into multiple segments via

1533
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:36,440
possibly like tahno stitching so loops

1534
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:39,570
aims to provide a loss recovery locally

1535
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:42,690
over some specific segments so that's

1536
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:45,210
the basic idea of loops so here are two

1537
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:47,250
pointers of the drafts so please read

1538
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:50,250
them and please join us tomorrow morning

1539
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:55,020
10:00 okay thanks

1540
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:55,020
[Applause]

1541
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:12,170
so I'm Tim April I'm here to talk

1542
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:14,840
quickly about the DNS transparency

1543
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:17,840
project um many of you are probably

1544
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,190
familiar about how DNS works it's pulled

1545
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,320
a system where there's no way to

1546
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:23,808
currently get a push based notification

1547
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:27,369
to arbitrary end-users without having to

1548
01:21:23,809 --> 01:21:29,900
arrange something with the DNS provider

1549
01:21:27,369 --> 01:21:31,339
this means that any short-term changes

1550
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:34,400
in the DNS that aren't being actively

1551
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:37,210
monitored well will get missed and there

1552
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,888
have been recent attacks if you look at

1553
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:41,809
if you were to go in google for sea

1554
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:43,010
turtle or DNS panel as you can see a

1555
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:45,770
whole write-up on some of these attacks

1556
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:48,040
that took advantage of the some of the

1557
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:50,719
weaknesses in that in the current model

1558
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,639
this project is proposing to create a

1559
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,739
system where there's a push or

1560
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,719
generating a push based model where we

1561
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:58,638
get data from registries and then

1562
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,900
propagate it out through a pub sub sort

1563
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,880
of system to the end users that are

1564
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:03,739
interested that could be a registrant it

1565
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,590
could be a user all sorts of things like

1566
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:08,690
that and this would get hopefully

1567
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:11,239
real-time updates from as many TL DS and

1568
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:13,759
then possibly later on second and third

1569
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:15,110
level domains as possible and then it'll

1570
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,059
aggregate that and ship it out to

1571
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:21,009
whoever wants to get it in hopefully

1572
01:22:17,059 --> 01:22:22,880
real-time or near real-time formats

1573
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:24,739
there are whole bunch of people involved

1574
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,190
you can talk to any of us I think

1575
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:29,449
there's only two of us here this week

1576
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:31,098
but the two of us that are here will be

1577
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:33,290
here all week we've also been working

1578
01:22:31,099 --> 01:22:34,579
with some people from a couple different

1579
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:36,739
governments around the world to try and

1580
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:40,670
figure out what exactly the consumers

1581
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:41,780
need and then if the things we're

1582
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:43,550
looking for right now if you're a

1583
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:45,050
registry or registry operator would be

1584
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:47,540
interested to talk about possibly what

1585
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:50,690
we could do to get data if you're a

1586
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:52,340
registrar or authority operators we'd be

1587
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:54,348
interested to talk later on about how we

1588
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,869
can get some of your data if you just

1589
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:58,940
want to see we have a very simple web

1590
01:22:56,869 --> 01:23:00,110
page up there and we also have a form

1591
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:02,449
where you can fill it if you want to get

1592
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:05,150
more information as we get more data

1593
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:09,199
than ships out we're in the process of

1594
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:10,579
trying to stand up or merge with a be

1595
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,799
taken under some other existing

1596
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:15,710
non-profit an independent agency or an

1597
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,030
organization so we can have a

1598
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:18,770
independent status

1599
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:21,290
build something that's hopefully

1600
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:23,120
available to the community at large and

1601
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:28,070
we're hoping to make it free to

1602
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:29,480
end-users so there's the link if you

1603
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,740
have any questions find me this week I

1604
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:42,790
don't want to stand between you and

1605
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:42,790
dinner all right thank you so the last

1606
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:49,970
session there less talk is mine so I

1607
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:51,260
know some of you know about this and

1608
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:53,540
been participating in it but not

1609
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:56,090
everybody maybe so this is kind of a

1610
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:58,460
hobby law side project I've been doing

1611
01:23:56,090 --> 01:24:00,980
at ITF meetings which is to try to do a

1612
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:02,780
little social event that's modeled on

1613
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:07,160
the sitcom outrageous opinion session

1614
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:09,830
and it was the ideas to do some

1615
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:11,960
satirical talks I was calling it bad

1616
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:13,580
idea Pecha Kucha for a while trying to

1617
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,860
generalize it to not strictly be Pecha

1618
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:17,510
Kucha format we've got several folks

1619
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:19,219
signed up now and I saw a few come into

1620
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:21,500
my inbox during the session so I think

1621
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:24,380
the list is growing it's Thursday night

1622
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:26,600
at 9:30 in Duluth which i think is the

1623
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:28,640
room right next door to here if you're

1624
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,520
interested in giving a talk you can do a

1625
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:33,200
Pecha Kucha which is a very structured

1626
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:37,310
twenty slides each slide is up for 20

1627
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:40,160
seconds should be mostly text free yeah

1628
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:41,630
or you can just do a short lightning

1629
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:46,220
talk it has to be less than seven

1630
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:48,890
minutes and the way to get time on the

1631
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:51,560
agenda is to send me an email with a

1632
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:54,170
talk title and and then I need slides by

1633
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,590
six o'clock on Thursday so everybody's

1634
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:57,680
