1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,570
we efficient in our presentation I also

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,540
ask the presenters to try to be to the

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,320
point and also if you have comments or

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,500
questions

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,480
make it quick we try to keep some time

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,089
for discussion also in the different

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,419
presentation of set of presentation so

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:28,918
this is a animated session one session

9
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:31,560
for this IHF week and gentleman sitting

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:34,440
next to me is Pedro material Julia from

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,199
NIH in Japan is one of the energy

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,559
Secretary's he was appointed earlier

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,420
this year but since Jo my new co-chair

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,610
is not here we wanted also to I like

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,010
that we are not alone in managing this

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,480
this research bit so thanks that were

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,150
popping here this is the note whale so

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,220
it it is a reminder of the IETF Follies

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,560
I mean the Archaea follow the IETF

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,839
policy answer see the reminder of the

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,670
IETF policies in effect on various

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,430
topics such as patterns and code of

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,159
conduct so I invite you to have a deeper

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,380
look into these different pointers and

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640
documents that you're aware about the

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,520
IETF policy of those topics thank you as

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,439
usual and we are need to go very quick

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,999
so thank speedor will be a minute taker

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,240
I will also assist him and if you want

30
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:28,109
help it's on the etherpad but we still

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,719
need a mythical scribe anyone willing to

32
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,068
just relay where we are in the

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,869
presentation and if there are any

34
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:37,069
questions for remote participants is

35
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,069
built with which I appreciated

36
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:46,759
yeah mythical scribe thanks will so two

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,259
blue sheets please kill the blue sheets

38
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,939
circulate the blue sheets if there are

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,909
new participants coming in the room it's

40
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,439
very important order to know who is

41
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,200
participating and for the future

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,389
meetings play yeah Jenna so this is the

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,310
introduction I will go quickly through a

44
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,990
bit of a research group information and

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,030
then we will have a set of technical

46
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,199
presentation

47
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,790
essentially this is centered on intern

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,619
base networking the main activity of

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,409
this research group currently we have

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,700
other activities but for this session is

51
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,849
essentially in some base

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,589
working so we will have Archer which

53
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,149
will be removed presenting on with

54
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,989
finding network intents for self-driving

55
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,610
networks and then we have a couple of a

56
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:32,220
set of presentation which are more on

57
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,349
the core in turn-based aspects and

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,280
architecture discussion so an update on

59
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,988
some draft intern classification by will

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,519
IBM concept patch packet life cycle and

61
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,239
functionality by Alex which will be

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,180
removed I hope so

63
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,150
yeah is here good and then a couple of

64
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,380
presentation more dedicated to the

65
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,140
architecture discussion that we are

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,120
starting in the research group I will do

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,458
one of the presentation on behalf of

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,110
Marino's which is in Europe so it is

69
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:12,060
right for him and we'll we'll also do a

70
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:17,190
presentation on behalf of young I jump

71
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,319
in okay we will have to check but I'm

72
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,220
not sure it was not in the planning that

73
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,839
she will do it remotely so a

74
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,670
presentation on intern driven management

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,459
framework which is a there is also draft

76
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,399
on that and then for this set of for a

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,319
presentation to have a H own discussion

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,230
to keep a bit of time for discussion for

79
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,929
this aspect and finally we also wanted

80
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,310
to report on some other activity that

81
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,290
are still ongoing in the research group

82
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,109
summary of AI phone network management

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,880
activities Pedro will make this summary

84
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,069
and also include a presentation on

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,630
status for the draft he has been

86
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,119
submitting to the group up on

87
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,900
intelligent reasoning on external events

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:02,690
on the track management any questions so

89
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:06,120
far on the agenda thank you

90
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:09,090
quick recap on the meeting plans so we

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,190
are in IETF 105 we are a regular session

92
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,370
right now and tomorrow photos interested

93
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,279
and I think you are aware that we are we

94
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,930
have a one day interim eating colleague

95
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,238
also workshop which will be dedicated

96
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,930
again to in turn based it working it

97
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,489
will be hosted in a very close

98
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,770
University engineering school so it's

99
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,260
called equal the technology superior or

100
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,780
the memorial and to biasted fire

101
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,370
dear friends but then the same location

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,440
as we did last year so we wanted to

103
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:42,030
repeat the experience and was a very

104
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,300
nice very nice version in October we

105
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,789
will be having an in-person interview in

106
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,520
Roma in Italy it will be co-located with

107
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,130
the network of the future hydrophilic

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,140
conference you cannot link to some

109
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,440
information about this conference in the

110
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,330
slide the the topic of this interim

111
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,400
meeting will be to go a bit more into

112
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,349
the practical activity of the research

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,409
group for in ten basic working so to

114
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,780
focus on proof of concepts and tool for

115
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,580
in turn based systems we would like to

116
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,250
have a gathering with people working on

117
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,669
implementing on some of the technical

118
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,470
aspect of intern base from a tool and I

119
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,300
would say implementation perspective and

120
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,300
bring together and see what what can

121
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,580
worked between ghosted we will send more

122
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,430
details on this internal meeting we are

123
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,229
preparing a call for demo and it will be

124
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,570
absolutely out we will provide more

125
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,690
information and you are all welcome to

126
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:40,320
come into to Roma in October first week

127
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:43,260
of October we've been to be in IETF 106

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,300
in Singapore and also based on the I

129
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,000
would say the output of the preparation

130
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,130
in October for the intervene to include

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,540
also participation the a curtain again

132
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,450
we will provide more information as soon

133
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,810
as we we know bit more how we would like

134
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,550
to participate in a concern we are we

135
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,290
will continue to run our monthly virtual

136
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,380
meeting which happens to be quite

137
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:07,110
successful and quite useful the next one

138
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,159
is planned for meet end of December we

139
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,110
just put a doodle for checking the best

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,750
slots and I think there will be an email

141
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:21,600
on the meaningless very soon to ask you

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:23,220
to put your availability there with your

143
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,550
own are working also on the charter of

144
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:31,860
date essentially to highlight the main

145
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,050
item of the research agenda that energy

146
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,840
is currently investigating so

147
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,360
proposing an umbrella text covering the

148
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,270
different topics but also providing a

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
more specific description on the intern

150
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,109
base topic including work plan

151
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,030
environment and my soul

152
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,280
the other topics also describe their

153
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,289
even if they are good less with the

154
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,700
detail there is a draft version

155
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,430
available at the link

156
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,870
it's very draft at the moment and we are

157
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,300
still working on that with your home the

158
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,180
idea is to stabilize that after the

159
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,070
summit your comments and feedback are

160
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,660
most welcome on this new chapter

161
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,570
so we have our session now the interim

162
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,430
will be tomorrow if you look at the link

163
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,750
in these slides and also on the mailing

164
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,840
list you have all the details for the

165
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,760
location the program all the nice things

166
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,789
that you have planned for this tomorrow

167
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,080
work and that's all any question before

168
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:30,420
we switch to the technical presentation

169
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,950
if not then I will invite Archer to get

170
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,950
ready and we put the slides

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:52,890
hello can you hear me yep oh nice man

172
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:56,030
can you also see me I'm not sure yes so

173
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,030
can you start

174
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,000
after you can go ahead okay thank you

175
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,040
so I'm here today guys to present our

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,200
work on refining Africa content for

177
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,420
self-driving networks this work was

178
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,380
actually published in a sitcom workshop

179
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,170
last year so let me start by introducing

180
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,030
you guys on what a self-driving Network

181
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,610
actually yes

182
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:37,569
well basically is a private network I

183
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:41,860
would ideally run itself but to do that

184
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:44,980
it would first need some guidance on how

185
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:51,490
to operate and how to behave can you go

186
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:53,350
over to the next slide please so here we

187
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,080
have a very high-level architecture of

188
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:59,590
what a network self-refer network could

189
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,020
be and of course here that guidance on

190
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,320
how to behave is what we call here in

191
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,090
this picture an indent that of course

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,370
has to be processed and now turned into

193
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:12,030
network configuration and then deployed

194
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,950
into the network from there a network

195
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,050
itself driver network would monitor

196
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,810
itself learned from the monitor data and

197
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,010
adapt this process over time if you go

198
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,800
over to the next slide please

199
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,530
you can see that the focus of our work

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,219
in this is the first part right here

201
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:32,319
that is marking red which consists in

202
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,510
basically translating the high-level

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,920
intent on how the network should behave

204
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,939
into network configuration so you can go

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,719
over in our next slide please

206
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,200
if you now if you wanted to do that

207
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,340
nowadays

208
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,900
you would have to rely on maybe

209
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,180
command-line interfaces for interest for

210
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,620
instances instances or configuration

211
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:59,370
using files maybe and if you go over to

212
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,370
the next slide please

213
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,630
Archer are you still here

214
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:46,819
okay maybe he's back after they were

215
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,250
open industry will can you put a

216
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,580
qualifier in the mythical stripe I think

217
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,029
that will really react to that if it's

218
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,029
still working

219
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:20,730
how can your ears Archer can you speak

220
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,360
please we we have the video feed but we

221
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,360
cannot hear you

222
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:46,100
hello yes go ahead please

223
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:47,959
okay so as I'm saying if we wanted to

224
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,389
cut if you use your using conventional

225
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,310
networks and you wanted to deploy an

226
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,410
intent you would have to break it down

227
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,170
to multiple command line interface

228
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,290
commanders but if you went a higher

229
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,800
level up and you can pass the next slide

230
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:06,469
you may be used programmable networks

231
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,810
you would have open flow interfaces or

232
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,759
before which is still which is very

233
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,040
useful but still very hard to manage

234
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:16,250
hair to master and very prone to

235
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,620
mistakes that is why many have proposed

236
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,199
and you can go over the next slide many

237
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,000
have proposed several network

238
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,040
programming languages configuration

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,490
abstraction such as speciation news

240
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,949
netcat and many others which are which

241
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,110
helped a lot in configurating networks

242
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,699
and entwine intents but still require

243
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,660
network operators to learn complicated

244
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:41,870
and master network programming languages

245
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,939
that are very not not very easy to do so

246
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,360
we asked ourselves in this work

247
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:50,389
could we go ahead and it would go a step

248
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,129
further and use natural language to

249
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,230
deploy an intent you can go over to the

250
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:58,309
next slide please

251
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:00,410
actually you can go to slides and so we

252
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:03,170
proposed a network content refinement

253
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,399
process using nyle as an abstraction

254
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,979
layer

255
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,529
nyow is basically a network intent

256
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,800
definition language we propose which

257
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:15,290
very closely resembles the English

258
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,019
language it is we designed it to be very

259
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,750
easy to read

260
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:23,120
and we do that because we use nyle as an

261
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,519
abstraction to ask for confirmation on

262
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,290
the information we extract from natural

263
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,930
language so there's two main points

264
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,129
thinking over two slides two main points

265
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:35,839
in this network intent refinement sec

266
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:38,779
networking that refinement process that

267
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,730
is we extract the intent from that

268
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,189
directly from natural language and you

269
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,610
only use nyle as an abstraction to

270
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:49,009
request for conquest confirmation you

271
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,140
can go over to the next slide please to

272
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:53,900
explain our process

273
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:57,260
let me let me describe this experimental

274
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:00,920
scenario we developed using our

275
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,400
prototype and sonata NFV which is a a

276
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,000
framework for deploying virtual network

277
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,079
functions and over mininet and so in

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,460
this scenario we set up to clients and

279
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,080
iperf clients and in UDP traffic and I

280
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,540
generally HTTP web client sending

281
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,060
traffic to servers over to open V

282
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,480
switches and so you can go over to the

283
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:32,089
next slide in this scenario if a network

284
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,760
operator wanted to maybe deploy to two

285
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,410
virtual network functions let's say a

286
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:42,380
firewall and an intrusion detection

287
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:47,050
system can you pass this light okay and

288
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,910
you can pass one and once again and so

289
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,699
using our proposed in that refinement

290
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,370
process an operator would only have to

291
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,630
reach a client that could be either a a

292
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,630
cell phone or a computer any device with

293
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,580
a chat bar interface such as Google

294
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:08,630
assistants which we use to develop our

295
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:11,120
prototype and so attached to Google

296
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,960
assistants we developed any entities

297
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,020
extractor

298
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,730
using dialogue flow which is a Google

299
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:21,620
proprietary - you can pass choose lights

300
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,500
what the entities extracts are do in

301
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,740
this scenario is process the text given

302
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,640
by the the operator and label each of

303
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:35,570
those words as a given entity we defined

304
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,280
for ingest for instance we look for in

305
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,589
the text the possible end points

306
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,050
possible middle box as possible QoS

307
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:44,450
requirements anything that an operator

308
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:49,670
might want might want to do to manage

309
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:52,520
its networks and so if you go over which

310
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,910
in this case right here is a pyro and

311
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,160
ideas and of course the origin and the

312
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,469
destination of the intent those

313
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,589
extractive entities are then sent over

314
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,610
to a intent or later you can pass one

315
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,649
flight

316
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:12,620
which is which is in fact a sequence to

317
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:15,019
sequence the learning model that

318
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,870
translates the entities extracted into a

319
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:22,010
fully-fledged niall intent you can pass

320
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,959
over to the next slide and so here you

321
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,560
can see the Nile and that generated from

322
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,869
that from that extract the text and you

323
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,969
can see that it's very easy to read even

324
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,880
if you don't know the syntax you can

325
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,070
understand what it's doing and we we

326
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,709
present that to the operator for him to

327
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:46,100
him or her to confirm that you can pass

328
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:48,829
over to the next slides you can and so

329
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,980
the upper if the operator confirms it we

330
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:53,989
you can pass over next slides you can

331
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:59,870
just go passing over the slice breath

332
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:03,860
when the yeah we get the feedback from

333
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,410
the operator and add it into the our

334
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,130
training database for the signal

335
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:13,189
sequence learning model and with that

336
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,620
deployed if that confirmed intent we

337
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,350
then pass it over to an intent deployer

338
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:21,198
which compiles it into nmv comments in

339
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:26,208
the final wasn't it into the network you

340
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,669
can pass over to the next slides that is

341
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:32,140
the general concept of our idea of our

342
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:37,010
inter a froth of our refinement process

343
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:40,940
for this for this I cannot see okay and

344
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:44,090
you can see there there generated nsnsv

345
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,919
comments and so those two commands are

346
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,689
then deployed in the network generating

347
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,660
or final result which is in the next

348
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,150
slide that is that all the traffic

349
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,570
coming from the iqrf plant now goes over

350
00:17:53,150 --> 00:18:00,890
through to two little boxes that the

351
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:03,379
operator requested you can just skip

352
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,900
over to the conclusion how we evaluated

353
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:09,200
we did some very preliminary evaluation

354
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,020
on this work but you can skip that it's

355
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,960
not very important I guess over to the

356
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,480
conclusions in summary we in this

357
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,970
evaluation we just show that

358
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:26,929
our work is has enough accuracy to to be

359
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:29,720
using a control scenario and so to

360
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,400
summarize well the question we posed was

361
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,590
how to deploy network intents using

362
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,419
natural language and so we proposed a

363
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,370
refinement processes in Nile that

364
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:41,530
requires very low technical knowledge

365
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:47,059
and uses feedback from the operators to

366
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:48,950
learn over time so we as future steps

367
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,928
this still ongoing research so we

368
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,480
planned to develop Nile compilation

369
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:55,669
process over to open flow and p4

370
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,770
backends and further evaluate this

371
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:02,720
proposal in terms of NMR GE maybe I'm

372
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,929
not sure I'm not very familiar with the

373
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,480
process of NMR G but I can see that I

374
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,850
can see there are at least three open

375
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,830
drafts and I'm sure a proposal could

376
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,260
contribute to some points in those

377
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,270
drafts maybe but that's basically it

378
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:22,700
thank you thank you very much for

379
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,950
ordering the remote presentation we have

380
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:34,090
five minutes for questions on the

381
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:36,950
plantation for marchers hello this is

382
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,320
developer site when you mentioned that

383
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:43,730
you're using Sonata are you using the so

384
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,830
not being emulator or because I saw this

385
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,330
mignonette and I was my impression was

386
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,770
that the way you're using this I mean

387
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:54,199
the vim emulator or reducing the full

388
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,660
framework now we were using a VI

389
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:02,660
emulator yeah that it's available in

390
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:06,020
Sonata but we used a a distribution that

391
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:12,049
they made available in github from the

392
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:14,030
VM that uses VI and emulator curious

393
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,580
because I think there is a will be

394
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:20,389
interesting when you mentioned is a open

395
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,428
flow and p4 by backends that you're

396
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,120
considering other potential backends I

397
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:30,300
mean if you have an architecture for the

398
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:34,559
back control we we considered that

399
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,149
to fully realize this this proposal we

400
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,040
will have to support traditional

401
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:42,450
networks so we were evaluating using

402
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:55,860
open config as a possible back-end in

403
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:58,440
thirds if not thanks again Archer

404
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,449
thank you stay online for for the rest

405
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,370
of the meeting and urge to give

406
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,480
follow-ups on the mailing list

407
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,479
thank you for you

408
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,970
hello everyone this is will do from

409
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:47,270
Poway so basically we have a very brief

410
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,660
short slot to present at the update of

411
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:54,620
this draft so basically we are we

412
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,720
updated it to zero one version and next

413
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,090
please

414
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,760
so first of all as some of you might not

415
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,720
be here in last meeting so they go of

416
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,970
this draft days to I to achieve agree

417
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,070
intent and related terminology and

418
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,820
classification because as you might know

419
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:16,250
that in all I mean there is a lot of SDS

420
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,950
are doing similar working intent however

421
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,050
the content term itself is kind of vague

422
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,330
and people are speaking with the same

423
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,290
term but with different meanings so here

424
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:30,379
we propose the several ways that to

425
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:33,770
classify this intent into for example

426
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:37,670
this whether is a user solution or when

427
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,770
to activate and a based on the life

428
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:43,940
cycle requirement or granularity

429
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,310
something like that and the scope I mean

430
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,650
in this draft and this scope is related

431
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,899
to the army not only the existing

432
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:53,150
network but also they some network in

433
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,550
the near future so basically they are

434
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:58,570
for example we have Sdn controllers and

435
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:04,010
also the network management systems and

436
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:08,360
some autonomic system and nodes next

437
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:11,270
piece so this is the history we proposed

438
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,699
the very beginning they've draft with

439
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:16,879
actor in there is a small father in the

440
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:20,120
name and a 0-0 version at last last

441
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,790
October and in this era before the idea

442
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,610
of meeting we we updated it to another

443
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,710
0-0 brilliant sorry for that and before

444
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,860
this meeting we update to zero one and

445
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:34,190
so the main update are listed here so we

446
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:36,560
got some feedback and comments from the

447
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,020
mailing list we addressed some of them

448
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,460
for example Brian's comments about it

449
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,780
some sentences and also we added more

450
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,360
detail the materials for example we

451
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,370
added a table I will talk about a little

452
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,010
and some

453
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,860
more contributions were collected into

454
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:59,129
this document also we did some small

455
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,719
modifications but they are still I need

456
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,710
to say that there are still some of the

457
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,170
comments with that not addressed by this

458
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,210
update because we start a new draft

459
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,910
because we think that too many

460
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,850
complicated I mean contents are in the

461
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,690
same document may lead to some

462
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,719
misunderstandings so we start a new

463
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:22,200
draft a called architecture so which

464
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,850
will address the bottom two comments

465
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,450
from brand and Iago

466
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:31,110
next please so this is the table of

467
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,840
content so basically we the main updates

468
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,820
if you checked it on the differences and

469
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,810
the mini updates are in the three main

470
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:45,149
sections listed in the red next please

471
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:48,210
and one update is that we add a table of

472
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,430
the intended users because if you look

473
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,680
at the ways of classification the first

474
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:56,250
one the first of all is the

475
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,590
classification based on the user meaning

476
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,050
that who are using the intent will give

477
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,610
the system a intend for it to translate

478
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:08,370
and to validate or to fulfill so we

479
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:11,939
basically we have three main areas carry

480
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:14,520
on PC and enterprises and in each area

481
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,980
we have several kinds of user for in the

482
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,840
machine carrier Network we have the

483
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,220
network operator and the service

484
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:26,280
designer service operators and customers

485
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,890
subscribers so that's it that's the I

486
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:33,530
mean this basically show you that in

487
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:36,270
this category I mean me in this way of

488
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:41,430
classifying intent how do we do that and

489
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:43,950
we also have another several tables and

490
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:46,730
the lists to tell you how do we classify

491
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,960
the intent next please

492
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:54,000
so the second updates are use kind of a

493
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,770
challenging and we wanted to actually we

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,840
we put in here to trigger more

495
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:01,320
discussions also during the week I

496
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,070
already talked with chairman and also

497
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,620
other authors of

498
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,530
other documents about this part so

499
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:11,889
basically we want to have a roadmap for

500
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,770
thee I mean not only about an intent but

501
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,640
also the network management so that you

502
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:22,090
will see that for example in which I

503
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,450
mean in which period in ten days are I

504
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,360
mean started and what will be the future

505
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,780
for them the intent as well as the

506
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,280
network management so based on our

507
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,770
because they are it's someone

508
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,080
publications recently about this network

509
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:40,480
Hutton made autonomous for example there

510
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,600
is a link here is about a white paper

511
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,940
from TMF which is recently published it

512
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,080
is hourly this year about a five level

513
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:53,890
actually it's zero to five there are six

514
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,879
levels of the network self-driving just

515
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:00,100
like what I mentioned in previous

516
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,320
presentation so indeed this white paper

517
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,270
actually there are several levels

518
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,220
defined meaning that if we look at the

519
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,530
evolution of network management so

520
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,080
what's the past was it currently and

521
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:18,250
what will be the future so in each

522
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,830
levels the the way we can show network

523
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:25,330
is different for example now we can have

524
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:29,560
our centralized way I mean to issue the

525
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:33,399
service to deploy the service and if we

526
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,350
have this intent work realized so in

527
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,290
future we can have this song intent

528
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:42,159
based way alpha control and managed it's

529
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:45,129
the system so we actually we put for

530
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,520
example the in level 2 and level 3 some

531
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:52,390
of the intent functionality can be

532
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,270
realized here so next please

533
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,120
due to the time limit I cannot explain

534
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,430
the details but those are all written in

535
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:04,330
our draft and the third part is actually

536
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:07,210
this is a contribution from petrol so

537
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:10,330
basically we add one small section to

538
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:15,180
discuss about the relationship with AI

539
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:17,399
and the intent so if we considering this

540
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:21,780
will contain AI in the intent based

541
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:25,290
system so we we will add an additional

542
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:29,460
dimension of how do we classify the

543
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:32,460
intense so basically here what petrol

544
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,430
proposed is that the degree of a

545
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,280
formality is an important dimension to

546
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,380
classify the intent so this is another I

547
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:45,240
mean way of classification

548
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:47,490
the next piece okay this is our and last

549
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,430
slides I hope I didn't waste too much

550
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:52,410
time so the conclusion is that if you

551
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,890
read the draft and you can see that we

552
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:58,440
already proposed of five or six ways to

553
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,140
classify the intent so the colors the

554
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,190
current version I think we already have

555
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:08,040
the means of I mean the intent means two

556
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:11,460
different stakeholders as well as they

557
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:14,790
the taxon don't own any of the

558
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,490
classification and we believe that this

559
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:20,220
might be a foundation of future

560
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:23,850
discussion not only in our I mean

561
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,250
emerge-ii or our tf-idf but also for the

562
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,340
other as deals that can may they may

563
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:32,100
refer to our I mean waste so that we

564
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,060
will know for interpreter GTP's working

565
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:39,360
and se is working he MFM yep well which

566
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:42,270
kind of intent what kind of what classic

567
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,500
class a class of intent they are talking

568
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:49,500
about so our next step will be we want

569
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,350
to refine this document by providing

570
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,800
some specification for the proposed

571
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:59,100
classification so a more formal

572
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:04,800
definition and also some prioritization

573
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:07,379
and discuss between the overlap and also

574
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,919
we as suggested by Laurent we will

575
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,470
probably add a section to describing the

576
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,340
state of ATO of intent for example what

577
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:20,940
other stos are working and which class

578
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,919
are they working on and also there's

579
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,850
some of the comments from million list

580
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,230
and offline so we are here we want to

581
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,080
ask for a volunteer

582
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,929
to help to review this document this is

583
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,870
not a very long one there's only about

584
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:41,010
less than 20 pages and also to

585
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:43,709
contribute and also I will ask for I

586
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,290
mean if the group is ready we will ask

587
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,510
for a adoption but this is not just for

588
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:51,629
the group this year so that's it that's

589
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:55,770
all my transition thank you we have time

590
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:59,160
for quick questions yeah I have some

591
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:02,400
comments to share I think it's an

592
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,340
important work and I really invite the

593
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,380
research group to provide videos on the

594
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,110
mailing list in order to improve the

595
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:15,120
quality of this work and because I think

596
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:17,250
it's important that we we bring clarity

597
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,309
in that space because as Will was

598
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,740
mentioning other activities outside up

599
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:25,500
in many definitions many approaches to

600
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,570
intern based networks and so I think one

601
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,000
of the the mission of an emerging that

602
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,549
space would be a good outcome will be to

603
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,350
provide clarity especially statical

604
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:38,190
relation if we manage to do it well it

605
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,990
can be a good tool for others in nursery

606
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,530
in the research and other standard

607
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:47,010
bodies to reuse our proposed

608
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:48,660
classification so I think this is a good

609
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,210
starting point I encourage this work to

610
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,610
continue and also with other exception

611
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,700
from the aura of the research field

612
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,699
thank you

613
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,300
I electronics can you talk please to see

614
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,420
we can hear you yes yes can you hear me

615
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:34,100
yes it's okay excellent

616
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:37,190
okay yeah so I'm going to provide the

617
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:42,320
next update on the draft cam and MLG

618
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:44,420
distributed and this intent and also on

619
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:57,010
behalf of my co-authors and next please

620
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:59,720
oh one previous sorry you skip one slide

621
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:04,309
okay yeah so yeah so here's a status

622
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,980
update yeah so maybe since the last ITF

623
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,410
we have updated this raft or revision 0

624
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,300
tool this followed the discussions that

625
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,450
we had they at the nm and G interim

626
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,300
meeting in San Jose today's why don't

627
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:20,450
have months ago a couple of updates that

628
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,879
have been done since then one thing

629
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,460
basically the title underwent this title

630
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,650
under with the slight change and there

631
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,630
have been numerous edits throughout

632
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,910
including missing a clear delineation

633
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,340
between intent and other concepts

634
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:37,730
facility policy that is something which

635
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:40,280
I think we generally have been

636
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:43,370
struggling with a little bit and we

637
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,290
added a few new sections month in busy

638
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,899
on first order principles of intent base

639
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,440
networking a new sectional intent life

640
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,300
cycle the goals into basically how do

641
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,510
house intent being measure us intent can

642
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,240
come into being how how how is it

643
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:01,250
modified and what happens it hurts a

644
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,500
fourth and then finally also we have a

645
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,559
new section on intent research

646
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:11,750
challenges since after all we are a

647
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:13,520
research group next please so the new

648
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,840
document structure or the update

649
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,330
document structure is what is depicted

650
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,859
here basically you see building we have

651
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:23,750
well really see it starts with the

652
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:26,330
introduction of the concepts what is

653
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,820
intent base the intent and investment

654
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,129
interface management and networking how

655
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,940
does it relate to other concepts and

656
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:36,480
this is followed by the

657
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:39,329
fools behind intent-based networking the

658
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,179
life's a key consideration and then the

659
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:44,609
functionality that is associate with

660
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:48,210
intent which includes not just intent

661
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:50,418
fulfillment but also intent assurance as

662
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,659
well and this whole thing is energy

663
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:56,250
concluded by the research challenges

664
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,520
next please

665
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,800
so we have only very limited time so I

666
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,140
will just make a skim over the skills

667
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,210
capabilities very quickly regarding the

668
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,390
intent content clarifications and

669
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:11,460
sending one of the things then that we

670
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,950
have that we discussed that that they

671
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,180
also did offside offside really

672
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,890
fundamentally what we need to bring

673
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,230
across that intent is fundamentally

674
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:22,259
outcome oriented so basically it is

675
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:24,810
about what outcomes doesn't ever provide

676
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,339
a expect not how those outcomes are

677
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,078
achieved which is basically supposed to

678
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:32,940
be provided by the intent based system

679
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:36,599
and accordingly the intent system not

680
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,480
the user is responsible for determining

681
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,609
how these desired outcomes can actually

682
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,260
be achieved in how should and how they

683
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:46,650
should be translated into actions

684
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,720
policies algorithms and so forth and so

685
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,030
from that definition is just very

686
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,910
briefly regarding the range of through

687
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,740
policy one item that was discussed was

688
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,560
that we believe it really actually

689
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,689
intent based relates the policy based in

690
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,078
similar ways how a I in machine learning

691
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,970
relates to two expert systems and

692
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,099
inference engine and so forth again

693
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,049
basically meaning that it n is defined

694
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,390
by the outcomes not so much how to

695
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,760
achieve them versus policies to define

696
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,859
rules the for instance events conditions

697
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,800
actions which say what's to do under

698
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:24,779
what circumstance so yeah next please

699
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,589
so regarding the first order set of

700
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,319
principles

701
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:30,089
yeah we did affine if there's a new

702
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,020
section in document on this this part a

703
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:33,540
set of principles

704
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,280
define which are certainly subject to

705
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,339
further discussion so here just very

706
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,040
briefly mentioning them so the first

707
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:43,290
principle is the single source and

708
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,020
single version of truth regarding intent

709
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,110
this is important to capture drift

710
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,640
the system and ensure the system

711
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,590
converges and it here still what was

712
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:57,560
actually intended as opposed to ability

713
00:36:51,590 --> 00:37:00,680
to change over time second principal

714
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,420
concerns one touch but not one shot this

715
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,810
basically indicates that it may actually

716
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:08,960
take in iterations and interactions to

717
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:11,620
arrive at the desired attempt and it's

718
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,240
not necessary it may not necessarily be

719
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,549
specified and declared once like you see

720
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,500
line or so would be amazing there will

721
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,900
be ambiguities that it will have to be

722
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,300
resolved unintended consequences that

723
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,130
have to be bought and so forth

724
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,580
third principle concerns over I mean

725
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,980
oversight this baby has to do with that

726
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,410
violent in pain basis and will conduct

727
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,570
tasks on its own users need to be given

728
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,210
the necessary tools so that the to

729
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:41,000
retain an understanding of the current

730
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,970
state and why things are happening that

731
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,140
are happening and fourth principle

732
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:50,990
concerns learning and so which means

733
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,609
it's intrinsically tied to AI this basic

734
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,680
means that the system should be able to

735
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,810
assess the effectiveness of its own

736
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,210
actions and be able to improve in order

737
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,650
to optimize those outcomes and interact

738
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,450
with dynamic conditions are changing

739
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,910
context on the on its own without the

740
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,310
without having the details I told what

741
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:09,680
to do and then finally we have explained

742
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,020
ability that the system should be able

743
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,540
to explain its actions and reason about

744
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,490
the effectiveness and again this is

745
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,759
really similar to some related

746
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,649
challenges in machine learning and then

747
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,270
finally abstractions that basically

748
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,890
users do not need to be concerned with

749
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:29,259
our intent will be mapped the

750
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,259
lower-level artifacts next please

751
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:36,230
okay so intent lifecycle and this is

752
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:39,500
also very much ongoing set up

753
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:41,690
discussions as this is indicated by the

754
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,350
fact that we have not just one but

755
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,760
actually two figures regarding this with

756
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,220
off pointing to the details here the

757
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,980
main thing is busy that the tenth life

758
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,140
cycle here is the busy distinguishes

759
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,770
between three different phases one thing

760
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:59,670
missing where the

761
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:02,640
Tempest is defined or articulated by

762
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,520
users from the second phase where they

763
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:10,520
where that is basically translated and

764
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,780
rendered into into some way that is

765
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,430
consumable and so forth part by my

766
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,680
controllers operating support systems

767
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:19,580
and so forth and then finally basically

768
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,069
this is followed by the operation phase

769
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,960
next slide please

770
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:28,350
so second view part of a second

771
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,180
perspective is slightly different in

772
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,040
terms of basically this one depicts

773
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,830
basically the difference between the

774
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,230
user space the network operation space

775
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:42,870
and the intent based system space in the

776
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:44,940
middle and indicating that intent the

777
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,640
intent lifecycle will involve both

778
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,410
fulfillment of operations for basically

779
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,600
where you go from recognizing

780
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,779
articulating the intent again to

781
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,089
translating it and rendering it into the

782
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,350
network to the network operation space

783
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,030
where things actually ultimately get

784
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:05,040
configured provision and orchestrate it

785
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:07,710
to them the the reverse phase very busy

786
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,330
monitor observe analyze a aggregated

787
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:14,000
finally basically enables users to

788
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:14,000
report on oversee next one

789
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:23,310
so finally just a small set of intent

790
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:26,759
research challenges and this is surely

791
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:28,230
will be an open-ended set of basically

792
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,480
the starter set basically there are

793
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,540
three things and that document

794
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,270
identifies what first aspect concerns

795
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,490
intent interfaces because really

796
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,650
ultimately the the goal is that the

797
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,589
system is able to infer the intent of

798
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,420
the user as opposed to the user having

799
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,400
to bating defiance of special language

800
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,350
and support that the system would not

801
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,120
have said so in that sense intent is

802
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,480
different from a yang data model is

803
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,180
different from a CLI or an RPC for

804
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,030
instance and so this involves human

805
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,890
machine interaction sorry you have busy

806
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,710
new styles of interfaces points and said

807
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,080
that allow also to clarify to iterate to

808
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:12,580
allow selection between different

809
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:14,020
of actions and so forth second set of

810
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,390
research challenges concerns the

811
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:19,090
explenation concern and proponent so one

812
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:23,410
fashion is of course and if all you do

813
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:26,710
is they find the outcomes that you want

814
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,790
and it's up to the system to act and the

815
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,590
question is really how do you retain

816
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,270
control over an understanding of what

817
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,450
the system is actually doing and if it

818
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:37,210
is actually yeah and busy explaining

819
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,589
where these things come from and of

820
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,810
course the ability to explain those

821
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,700
actions is important to for a lot of

822
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,190
activities from troubleshooting the

823
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:49,149
system improving the confidence of users

824
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,400
and ultimately also our users to to

825
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,290
still retain a measure of control and

826
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,060
then finally basically I mean metrics

827
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,770
concerns the assessing the effectiveness

828
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:01,630
of the outcomes of the intent based

829
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:05,980
systems that progress and so forth next

830
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:08,080
one and yeah I think the most last step

831
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,610
so sorry that was a very very quick

832
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,870
run-through but these are basically the

833
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,980
additions which are in the government

834
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:17,589
and we expect a lot more discussion and

835
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,780
ultimately we hope that we can at some

836
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:23,460
point request adoption of this is a

837
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,460
working group item Thanks

838
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:45,670
thanks Alex we opened a couple comments

839
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:48,950
to the Milanese about several sections

840
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:52,520
as I said I also have some comments too

841
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:54,799
though those two life cycle figures so

842
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,580
first of all as we mentioned that we

843
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,450
have a five or six principles however in

844
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,069
the first figure some of the principles

845
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,399
didn't show there for example we don't

846
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:10,940
have an urn function and also the

847
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,849
validation part is kind of a I'm not

848
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:16,359
sure this validation is what kind of

849
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:19,880
coming what what are we ready teaching

850
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:24,710
here and my second comments will be that

851
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:27,530
so I think if two figures are not

852
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,300
aligned with each other so I would

853
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:32,060
suggest that the Y in our next version

854
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:34,300
we may because we are actually we're

855
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,920
accustomed only want to show its

856
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,700
lifecycle fingers so I think we can

857
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:46,670
merge them into one into one just to be

858
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:48,770
more consistent okay I have some of the

859
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,460
other comments and I will send it to the

860
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,560
mailing list

861
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,330
sure yes also this is a bigger response

862
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,910
first of all yeah I'll respond to them

863
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,348
and so the mailing list separately of

864
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,569
this didn't have the chance to do so

865
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:01,310
beforehand and we gotta get our items

866
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,380
there were a couple of items one thing

867
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,210
missing regarding alignment of the

868
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,609
figures and regarding some things that

869
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,530
require adjustments absolutely this is

870
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:11,930
very much basically still a little bit

871
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:15,440
in RAW format further discussions about

872
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:17,210
unity we do intend to who either align

873
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,020
these figures obviously make it clear

874
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,520
that they are really different

875
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,210
viewpoints and showing placing different

876
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,859
aspects regarding the validation

877
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,670
one last thing of the validation

878
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:30,670
concerns and validating that the network

879
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,410
probably that the actions in network is

880
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,540
saying that they do actually sill it

881
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,750
here and confirm to what was intended so

882
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,220
maybe it is related to this assurance

883
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,530
aspect of this so perhaps this then

884
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,319
perhaps we need to work it for now but

885
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:48,980
this is just a very quick response to to

886
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,460
this point other items that are several

887
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,369
questions I'm missing something

888
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:57,140
yeah I think you didn't miss any simple

889
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,960
just the vanity with the validation

890
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,250
function block in these two figures the

891
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,950
location are different I mean the

892
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,950
position so that might be confused with

893
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,890
education again

894
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,020
this is working progress two figures it

895
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:13,700
really reflects the fact that among the

896
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,730
authors have been different views that

897
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,029
about it stylized just this the validate

898
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:22,609
in this diagram is to validate I would

899
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:25,820
say the correctness of the intent

900
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:27,859
expression the validated shrugging the

901
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,810
second life cycle is more as Alex was

902
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:33,819
mentioning kind of validate or verify

903
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:36,200
maybe more how well the intent was

904
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:39,430
actuated on the network and if there is

905
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,390
some drift so to measure is the

906
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,339
difference between the intended

907
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,379
configuration and the actual computers

908
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:47,810
yeah that's why I said if we use the

909
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,030
same term in two figures that we really

910
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:52,910
see also that in the presentation from

911
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:54,820
Kim there will be also this validation

912
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,230
aspect that comes yeah so I think it's a

913
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:01,720
means that it's an important aspect that

914
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,720
we are still not at the end of the story

915
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,770
using an idea terminology we are

916
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,900
comparing operational derive States

917
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,089
against intended state and if there is

918
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,950
dealt that system should figure out how

919
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:20,630
to get to the intended stick this is

920
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:22,430
legitimate ILX binoculars so I read a

921
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:24,290
draft this afternoon it's a good start

922
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,230
right but it seemed that there is a

923
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:29,210
focus on configuration right what you

924
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,070
just mentioned with the derive state so

925
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,599
this is what you call in that not like

926
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:34,040
okay I want to configure something I've

927
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,900
got an intended state and I see the

928
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,240
applied state which is pure

929
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,670
configuration I think like that the key

930
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,098
that we that we need to focus on also is

931
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,589
the Asscher part and assure parts about

932
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:48,380
operational data and this is like the

933
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:49,880
big issue in intent right how do we make

934
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,180
sure that it's not about making sure

935
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,650
your stuff is configured right sure it's

936
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,060
configured fine but it

937
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,100
also about trying to find the

938
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,610
operational data to make sure it works

939
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,799
that is up and running it's like in the

940
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,680
example with the first example with the

941
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,530
firewall right great your firewall is

942
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,629
configure is this your intent well no

943
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,120
you want to work your wall to be up and

944
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,260
running so this is maybe one part where

945
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,049
when I read a draft

946
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,030
we need read both focus there and maybe

947
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,700
this is such a difficult part in the

948
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:26,960
intent base that it should be in the

949
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:29,210
what you call the research research

950
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,490
challenges and then I was pretty sure if

951
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,410
this was the one you mentioned by ibn

952
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:37,129
metrics there because they only three

953
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:39,620
lines there and it is just you know just

954
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,620
accessing assessing the effectiveness of

955
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:45,350
the configuration yeah great sure we

956
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,839
want to assure that it's running as we

957
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:52,250
want which is a big difference that it's

958
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:54,650
up and running it's just Jeff so I would

959
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:56,030
like to disagree with the derive state

960
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,570
it's not the configuration of that it's

961
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:03,470
the result of configuration so if I have

962
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:05,540
lldp or BGP or any other way to derive

963
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,459
state the states that's going to be

964
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,050
compared to intended not what they've

965
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,480
configured it's real validation of

966
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:15,580
operational State plus things that I've

967
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,580
learned that heaven configures its basis

968
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:24,020
so quick responses over I completely

969
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,339
agree regarding the importance of

970
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,350
assurance this is something that is

971
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,470
often missing we will need to make this

972
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,910
clearer and actually regarding the

973
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,740
assurance I think there are more aspects

974
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,930
and just making sure that the system is

975
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,629
running it is also busy the effect to

976
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:41,359
assess how effective is a translation of

977
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,590
the of the design outcomes into the

978
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,980
system so there are there are several

979
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:49,150
dimensions of this but anyway I will

980
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,150
need to explain all aspects

981
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,190
hello

982
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:06,810
Sabine here I have a question about

983
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:14,740
maybe slide to where you characterize

984
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:16,930
your intent maybe not so about the

985
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:20,470
outcome the fact that its outcome

986
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:24,368
oriented so you say the the presentation

987
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:31,169
says what outcomes does a network

988
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:35,650
provider expect and well I would have

989
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:38,950
expected that the out that it would be

990
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:42,400
what outcome does the user of the intent

991
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:45,790
expect because intends are not intended

992
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,940
only for operations I would rather see

993
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:52,570
it for because it's so extracted for

994
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:54,100
like third parties ago sure so I guess

995
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,860
it's the question being who the actors

996
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,240
are right when you say the intent user

997
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,369
there are different roles I completely

998
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,709
do agree there that there are different

999
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:04,690
parties to that and I think some of this

1000
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:07,390
will also relate to the terminology or

1001
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:10,270
taxonomy in terms of that there is but

1002
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,430
one a certainly the network or a network

1003
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,380
provider and but they are going to be

1004
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:18,250
you know they are going to be other

1005
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:19,540
parties as well so take this as analytic

1006
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,050
provider okay is it

1007
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:25,119
slash slash user and later on of course

1008
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,800
these things will have to be related it

1009
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,990
outcomes at different levels right there

1010
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,880
will be different there are going to be

1011
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,850
a high level of something they're going

1012
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,119
to be more specific outcomes on specific

1013
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:41,040
service instances for instance can I

1014
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:45,070
have a second question regarding the the

1015
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:48,700
validation although the user feedback so

1016
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,250
right now it seems to be focused on did

1017
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,649
I did I understand you correctly well I

1018
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:59,710
see that you also have a reporting and

1019
00:50:53,650 --> 00:51:03,070
the phase do you do you intend to to

1020
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:06,400
specify different levels of validation

1021
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:08,020
for example first step would be well did

1022
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,369
i compile your

1023
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,759
well did I understand you correctly

1024
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:14,590
validate and then maybe the system would

1025
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,040
have other feedback such as is it

1026
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:21,340
feasible regarding network capabilities

1027
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,860
for example yes yes all the short answer

1028
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,380
is yes there is a section in the

1029
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,970
document that talks to functions or

1030
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,160
functionality that will need to provide

1031
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,680
if I'm in a formal intent based system

1032
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,830
and this is basic where we would yeah

1033
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,440
maybe this busy where those yeah where

1034
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:41,140
those things would be accounted for this

1035
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,140
would be where is it in section 7 I

1036
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,430
guess which we didn't which I which I

1037
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,830
didn't go into here in this presentation

1038
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:49,480
because there is deposit it hasn't

1039
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:52,210
changed much bother versus the previous

1040
00:51:49,480 --> 00:52:05,380
version ok thank you

1041
00:51:52,210 --> 00:52:07,000
savvy I will encourage yeah that wasn't

1042
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,310
what about to say so I mean I think your

1043
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,050
comments are valid and good can you

1044
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,060
bring them to the meaning list or at

1045
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:15,520
least in the video of the traffic will

1046
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,920
be very much useful to progress this

1047
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:24,580
work and see what what are the required

1048
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:28,570
actions then Bogdanovic my main concern

1049
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,319
is about the assurance so how we will do

1050
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:33,310
the assurance

1051
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:35,109
well let's we have a what is

1052
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,359
configurational data what is provisional

1053
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:40,000
data both provisioning data and then

1054
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,210
when how we will do the translation and

1055
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,280
assurance that the configuration has

1056
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:47,770
been translated in the right operational

1057
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:52,240
model because even within the same

1058
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:54,310
vendors we have different models that

1059
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,140
where they have multiple different

1060
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,920
configuration operational models they

1061
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:01,868
don't they do not match and how how you

1062
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,490
will solve it I sign the next two graphs

1063
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:05,320
that you did will be present if they are

1064
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:07,359
at some price at that but that is

1065
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,060
becoming you know a significant problem

1066
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,900
how to make sure that this that you can

1067
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,750
really verify

1068
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,369
oh this was my configurational data that

1069
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,740
change in the provisional data because

1070
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:19,720
I'm getting some dynamic inputs from

1071
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,479
other systems and then what I'm getting

1072
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,399
from the rest of the network

1073
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,790
how can Erica dive intent has been

1074
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,620
really translated correctly okay yeah

1075
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:34,040
thank you for this comment I think part

1076
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:36,020
of this actually is actually I agree

1077
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,070
this is needed I do think this is

1078
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,050
actually where some of the research

1079
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:43,550
challenges lie right because this

1080
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:46,370
relates to explaining that explain if

1081
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:47,420
Isis what you did to why why the actions

1082
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:50,930
as about Mita

1083
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:54,070
are supposed to meet the desired

1084
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,069
outcomes and so forth

1085
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:02,440
Alex but not here so the question I'm

1086
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:05,390
asking is can research solve that one

1087
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,760
because whenever you said oh hey we're

1088
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:10,339
going to apply a is for it what I'm

1089
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,840
thinking well no it's I mean it's

1090
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,780
something to work right you need like

1091
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,310
the domain knowledge expertise to be

1092
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,460
able to assure that if you're covering

1093
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:23,029
blah this one will be assured by itself

1094
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:25,340
and within the for context so I think

1095
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:27,320
the first point is to see if it can be

1096
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,690
solve is to articulate it clearly as a

1097
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:32,030
research problem and then see when then

1098
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:33,800
charge the research community to come up

1099
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:37,010
with solutions for this but I guess one

1100
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:40,610
part so so first of all for us this the

1101
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:42,410
challenges well not simply to solve it

1102
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,570
but maybe is first step to really

1103
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:47,240
articulate what the problem is and get

1104
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:49,070
people working on that let's look for

1105
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,259
this next presentation and this draft

1106
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,730
and then we can put this correlation

1107
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,780
between them because this one will put

1108
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:58,760
some of you know this kind of set of

1109
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,970
presentation you're already be on the

1110
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,970
schedule

1111
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,939
so I'm going to x12 talk about in fact

1112
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,700
the slides were prepared by in Marino's

1113
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:17,619
is in Europe so it could be difficult

1114
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:20,029
for intrude to be up in present so I

1115
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:21,530
tried to do the presentation on his

1116
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:24,589
behalf I've been working with him on

1117
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:26,660
some of those consideration essentially

1118
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:31,220
the first slide and then model the

1119
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:33,879
functionality are from Mario's here what

1120
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:35,899
I'm going to highlight is more some

1121
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,310
consideration I would like us at the

1122
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,400
research group and we develop our work

1123
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:43,040
on the architecture for intern based

1124
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,859
systems I would say to start the right

1125
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,339
ray and to scope it well in the sense

1126
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:52,910
that we are already having some proposal

1127
00:55:49,339 --> 00:55:54,980
for architecture on intern based systems

1128
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:58,129
but we don't have a clear program

1129
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,900
statement first challenges we start to

1130
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:02,750
see challenges in some of the draft and

1131
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,670
I will say a limited set of requirements

1132
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,250
will be good as starting point so let's

1133
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:09,140
try also in our next steps in the

1134
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:13,400
research group for this type of activity

1135
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:15,470
to address at least those points quickly

1136
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:20,720
and well and then we can jump into the

1137
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:23,629
architectural discussion also too I will

1138
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,450
recommend the research group to focus on

1139
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:29,810
in 10 driven Eaton base or whatever in

1140
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:32,230
10 define aspects specific aspect of the

1141
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:34,940
work we are doing and not to try to

1142
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:37,040
consider kind of general management

1143
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,440
framework or automation framework and

1144
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,859
say okay we don't have configuring the

1145
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,839
devices and different levels in that

1146
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:47,710
architecture so really try to extract

1147
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:50,330
out of this design activity what is

1148
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:52,599
specific to do it in in 10 base style

1149
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:56,540
Newton based approach and not to try to

1150
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:59,810
go into the other with the layers of the

1151
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:03,259
system in terms of design principles and

1152
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:04,910
methodology we are still discussing this

1153
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:09,890
between Mariners and I hope tomorrow

1154
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:12,049
will touch on that a bit is to put some

1155
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:14,629
principles in design principles in you

1156
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:17,450
know we want to do our architecture work

1157
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:19,850
and aim for simplicity so not try to

1158
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:21,649
over engineering things

1159
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:23,839
very important I think to provide

1160
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:26,600
flexibility in how the architecture will

1161
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,740
be provided so that it can be easily

1162
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,350
reused or integrated with other

1163
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:35,450
implementation or frameworks beyond

1164
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:38,779
energy and beyond strictly speaking in

1165
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:42,230
turn based systems extensibility in the

1166
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:44,240
sense of having modular design so that

1167
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,490
we can plug in plug out different

1168
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,220
functionality also over time if we think

1169
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:50,209
there are new approaches or new

1170
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,339
functionality that could be useful in

1171
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,780
that intent-based framework so that we

1172
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:56,420
don't have to redesign all the

1173
00:57:53,780 --> 00:58:00,160
connectivity between the blocks to just

1174
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:03,320
add some some subpersonality order order

1175
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:06,200
with order other components and Integra

1176
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,960
bility or integration is the fact that I

1177
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:11,060
really believe the an intern based

1178
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,450
system we if we design it as a kind of

1179
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:17,990
stand-alone architecture completely out

1180
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:19,730
of connection with other systems that we

1181
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,470
are also developing IETF but also in

1182
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:25,250
other groups or in the research and

1183
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:26,870
industry products it will fail we have

1184
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,340
seen that for other initiatives I think

1185
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,710
we should really that's all I said we

1186
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:34,460
need to focus on the intense specifics

1187
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:37,190
and to think at the design time how we

1188
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:40,910
will plug this into I don't know with

1189
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:42,770
nlv with Sdn with 5g types of

1190
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,589
architecture and also costs or other

1191
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:47,450
types of network but we should not put

1192
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:49,550
it completely standalone completely

1193
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:51,200
isolated we should think that it will be

1194
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:53,510
integrated I mean even I can take only

1195
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,970
one block one module of this framework

1196
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:57,740
and I can plug it into something else

1197
00:58:55,970 --> 00:59:01,520
and it will help to bring the system

1198
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:03,109
towards more intent based systems final

1199
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,759
point consider service based

1200
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,890
architecture approach and principles

1201
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,840
this is to highlight a bit the previous

1202
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:10,580
point on simplicity extensibility

1203
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,650
excetera is that service based

1204
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,090
architecture could be a nice approach to

1205
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,000
consider I'm not putting any

1206
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:19,610
prerequisite on that but we have seen

1207
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,980
recently more specification coming from

1208
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:24,590
the standardization organization that

1209
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,480
use service base architecture it's just

1210
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:30,770
an open point we want to go this way or

1211
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,330
not not so critical at that stage

1212
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,980
other consideration for the design of

1213
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:37,430
intent-based network in turn based

1214
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,140
systems stating first the objectives

1215
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:43,160
simplify the configuration of complex

1216
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:45,290
infrastructures so a couple of hours a

1217
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,839
consideration in terms would be agnostic

1218
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,940
of implementation details so the

1219
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,920
importance of the right abstractions at

1220
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,350
the design time what should be the lower

1221
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,600
boundary of an Indian architecture watch

1222
00:59:54,350 --> 01:00:00,650
what it should configure we can see in

1223
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:02,450
the next slide proposal for that and I

1224
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:05,119
think this relates to what I say bent

1225
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:08,270
and specific not try to run to make a

1226
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:10,400
full management architecture how Ibn

1227
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:12,100
coexist with legacy management system

1228
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,480
and emerging management technologies

1229
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,160
automatic decomposition of intense and

1230
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,680
continuous and firmness of intents are

1231
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,730
more related to critical functionality

1232
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:25,009
we aim for for this system so

1233
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:28,190
determining the lower Ibn boundary again

1234
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:30,020
this is a proposal still being discussed

1235
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:31,520
between marinos and i and of course we

1236
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,590
want to expose it to the research who

1237
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,950
for for your consideration a first

1238
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:39,640
option so to go up to configuring I will

1239
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:45,640
see the network device network elements

1240
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:47,810
another if you have the am bogdanovich

1241
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,600
my main issue here is with the

1242
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,460
management system you have to define it

1243
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,830
most of the management system today in

1244
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,660
place our element management systems

1245
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,700
they are not providing you what you need

1246
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:02,118
on the underlying you know from the

1247
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:05,950
underlying management system they will

1248
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:08,300
provide you implementation level api's

1249
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:12,230
which will be very hard for you to on

1250
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,510
translate your Ibn api's into the device

1251
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,720
you are you will end up as the option

1252
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:20,270
one and all the issues here so for

1253
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:23,330
really to be determining the lower lower

1254
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:26,180
Ibn boundary we should define what kind

1255
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:28,910
of management system we would expect the

1256
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,890
IBM to talk the IBM to talk to most of

1257
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:32,960
the when people say management system

1258
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:35,450
have an EMS in place I want to talk to

1259
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,160
the EMS and then all the again I will

1260
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:39,410
mention again all the implementation

1261
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,160
details are being exposed and then how

1262
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,020
will you do it

1263
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,279
on each different vendor in each

1264
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,009
different software release and into

1265
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,080
different versions

1266
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,359
I agree with your point on the current

1267
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,040
situation and I think it's also um I'm

1268
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:52,950
not in the aid of of Marino's but I

1269
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,410
think he has specific absorptions for

1270
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:58,680
option one and option two which you can

1271
01:01:55,410 --> 01:02:00,930
see a bit here if you look at the bottom

1272
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,118
part where you have this output of the

1273
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:05,549
decomposition logic configuring

1274
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,170
management function when it is aiming at

1275
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,600
management system management function is

1276
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:12,690
not thinking about an EMS type of thing

1277
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,520
but more abstractions of different

1278
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:16,470
capabilities in the network and we can

1279
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,660
wrap them as management functions and

1280
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:21,540
this is why why you want it that this is

1281
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:23,359
the target of the I would say the lower

1282
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:28,109
level that an intern based system should

1283
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:30,090
output there is so some of his

1284
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:33,900
assumptions because they're they're not

1285
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:35,850
in the document it would be good for his

1286
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,619
assumptions to be at least described

1287
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:39,600
there is no document and it's just a

1288
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,980
slide for this one the draft is on the

1289
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:47,250
other presentation but this one has no

1290
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:50,640
draft yet I mean all your points are

1291
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:52,859
valid I agree and we need to meet make

1292
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,560
explicit our assumptions and this is

1293
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:57,029
clearly open discussion but if you are

1294
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,529
referring to a draft on architecture

1295
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,580
discussion this is not the right

1296
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,109
presentation this is the next

1297
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,299
presentation from Keyon which has a

1298
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:05,009
draft and some diagrams and mix em up

1299
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,890
this is to two different threads and we

1300
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:14,160
try to stop this discussion but your

1301
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:16,109
point are valid so option one again to

1302
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,868
configure directly the device or to

1303
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:21,900
configure management functions with some

1304
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:24,080
implications on what the architecture

1305
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,520
should include or not include and also

1306
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:30,060
properties I will say good less good

1307
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,710
properties of the resulting solution for

1308
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:35,910
the sake of time I will not go into too

1309
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:38,700
much detail here this is a general

1310
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:42,720
diagram to highlight main the main

1311
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:45,450
functions marinos and I are thinking

1312
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,459
about in the functionality for the

1313
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,379
architecture and all they relate a bit

1314
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,630
to each other the important aspect is

1315
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,720
more on the next slides to set of slide

1316
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:57,390
to slide sorry what are the different

1317
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,730
functionality providing Saudi offering

1318
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:01,230
to a level technical requirement that

1319
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:06,170
drives the management function so this

1320
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:08,520
is to capture core part of the intent

1321
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,830
base to also that the previous comments

1322
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,300
for the previous presentation

1323
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:15,000
considering different types of intense

1324
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:17,250
if it's an user or customer make he will

1325
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,520
Express service types of intense what I

1326
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:22,220
want the provider to give me for my

1327
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,750
business for my business logic and

1328
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,580
operator type or infrastructure type of

1329
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:30,030
intent which is more I'm a network

1330
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:32,190
operator I have to satisfy user intent I

1331
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:34,350
can also express operationally intent to

1332
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:36,330
say this is all I want my network to

1333
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,060
react to those intents without going

1334
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:41,250
into all the technical details of

1335
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:42,890
provisioning and trade-off on cost

1336
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:47,010
robustness ability cetera

1337
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:48,569
the decomposition logic block so to

1338
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:51,420
resolve the intent to the relevant

1339
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,740
service up to to resolve intent to

1340
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,930
relevant service and select the

1341
01:04:52,740 --> 01:05:00,060
appropriate management function so this

1342
01:04:54,930 --> 01:05:01,830
is I like what will be the choice of the

1343
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,420
mail with the network management

1344
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:07,290
function computation or storage

1345
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,800
management function and also including

1346
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:12,720
the method and techniques that will be

1347
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,910
realizing this this decomposition logic

1348
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,299
but I think we should not in the

1349
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:19,680
research group specification or work

1350
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:22,170
prescribe what those specific methods

1351
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,990
should be to leave it open and we can

1352
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:26,790
make examples and validation on to prove

1353
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,979
that it's working but not to prescribe a

1354
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:30,600
specific choices of measurement

1355
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:32,580
techniques or implementation but maybe

1356
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,339
what's working well and unless way law

1357
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:37,799
is well-suited not work suit so in order

1358
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:40,290
to go from very simple techniques like

1359
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:42,780
mapping up to more elaborated reasoning

1360
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:45,180
capabilities the composition is

1361
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,980
facilitated by an abstract

1362
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,049
infrastructure model resources and

1363
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:53,670
communities what you can see also on the

1364
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:55,620
previous slides to expose exposure an

1365
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:57,480
exposure framework on the on the

1366
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:00,839
infrastructure service and management

1367
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,370
function descriptors to represent the

1368
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,400
capabilities of your management

1369
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:07,680
functions and optionally a knowledgebase

1370
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,180
to store prior knowledge and best

1371
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,950
practices on how intents in be really

1372
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:16,210
I've been actuated and the performance

1373
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:19,419
of this actuation going on with the

1374
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:21,339
other elements of the proposed

1375
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,109
architecture or for consideration in

1376
01:06:21,339 --> 01:06:25,599
terms repository to store and retrieve

1377
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:27,910
intends 11 and low intent representation

1378
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:30,039
again if we in the draft of the

1379
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,250
plantation from Alex we have this single

1380
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:35,529
source of truth we need to have

1381
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:39,089
artifacts to support this this principle

1382
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:42,359
and to be able or unable to make

1383
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:44,349
interesting operation to me if we

1384
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:45,549
estimate that there is a drift between

1385
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:47,109
the intended and the actual

1386
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:47,920
configuration of the actual state of the

1387
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:50,078
network

1388
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,440
this is typically a tool that we can use

1389
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,440
to it

1390
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:23,010
okay consistency analysis to detect and

1391
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:24,930
resolve the inconsistency at the

1392
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,890
expression of the intent and tradition

1393
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:29,069
to the to the configuration

1394
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:32,240
specification errors competing goals how

1395
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:36,420
to resolve those sometimes contradicting

1396
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:38,098
questions or ask to the network and to

1397
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:40,380
carry out this is carry out during the

1398
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,880
decomposition phase interface to the

1399
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,049
management systems or selected

1400
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,460
management function and execution

1401
01:07:43,049 --> 01:07:47,579
parameter this is typically kind of

1402
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:50,299
so-called software interfaces or IP is

1403
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:52,790
to call the right controllers the right

1404
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:55,109
EMS management system interfaces

1405
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:56,579
Orchestra star coordinator as contact

1406
01:07:55,109 --> 01:08:01,650
point in infrastructure management

1407
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:04,859
system also the feedback here to report

1408
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:07,140
on the actual state of the network and

1409
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:12,359
then to allow this comparison analysis

1410
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:15,140
of of the trip and then that's the end

1411
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:15,140
of the presentation

1412
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,520
Just Answer a sacrament and from

1413
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:32,370
personal experience the intent

1414
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,440
consumption interface seems to be the

1415
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:36,689
most complicated one she's not something

1416
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:40,108
southbound of intent system in

1417
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:42,029
composition of the consumption so the

1418
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:46,320
interface between business logic and

1419
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:47,639
intend by system I serve today I think

1420
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,920
everyone who is trying to build

1421
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,170
something keeps building kind of number

1422
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:56,370
of workflows trying to do this there's

1423
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:58,710
no standardization and trying to connect

1424
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:01,170
and then by system this business logic

1425
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:03,359
is an extremely complicated exercise

1426
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:06,240
pretty much you cannot do anything

1427
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,520
unless you try to just hug things

1428
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:11,580
together so I think would be really good

1429
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:14,010
to address at least try to think how it

1430
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:16,800
could look like and how business logic

1431
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:22,260
has BSS layer could interact with the

1432
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:23,520
intent based system agree and I don't

1433
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,890
want to put every discussion for

1434
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,050
tomorrow but what I exposed to the

1435
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:31,050
meaning is us something I would like us

1436
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:35,220
to discuss tomorrow is using examples of

1437
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:37,260
so-called intent expressions and I like

1438
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:39,660
what other typical structural part of

1439
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:41,100
this intent capturing the the functional

1440
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:44,819
part for instance what is the business

1441
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:47,750
express in the intent in all I mean what

1442
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:51,389
supporting languages or logic we need to

1443
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:53,490
apologies we need to support not making

1444
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:56,160
any choice on languages but what will be

1445
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:59,070
key properties between we will enable us

1446
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:02,250
manipulate those functional parts and

1447
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:06,269
derive it to more the capabilities of

1448
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:08,160
the system Brian carpenter your first

1449
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:15,840
open question was whether you would

1450
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:17,940
again would interface to the two to the

1451
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,320
devices or to the management system I

1452
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,969
think it's probably more complicated

1453
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,360
than that because I think there's

1454
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:28,100
certainly a third option which is

1455
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:30,599
interfacing two distinct Service agents

1456
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:34,479
for example a service agent that's

1457
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:36,099
managing well address prefixes

1458
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,869
you know so you're not talking the

1459
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:41,079
device you're into a function which is

1460
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:42,549
somehow this out might be part of the

1461
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:45,459
management system but it's not the

1462
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:48,639
management system I agree with you this

1463
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:51,369
is starting point and again I don't want

1464
01:10:48,639 --> 01:10:53,499
to distract myself but this is more

1465
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:55,749
proposal from from Marino's we are still

1466
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:58,780
working on that I'm also working on

1467
01:10:55,749 --> 01:11:00,519
order for instance it's easy lesson

1468
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:03,280
there is an framework that is proposed

1469
01:11:00,519 --> 01:11:04,959
that as a bit more intermediate layers

1470
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,239
to to in this kind of so-called

1471
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:09,639
management system I think ibn could be a

1472
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:10,150
good addition to that but I agree with

1473
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:12,099
you Brian

1474
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:16,629
let me be more than one add those two

1475
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:17,019
options Dean wanted to make a comment

1476
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:33,550
now

1477
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:36,269
I can try but that's a good transition

1478
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,269
thanks you go

1479
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:56,330
you can go ahead try to speak this hello

1480
01:11:52,090 --> 01:12:00,620
hello hello this is income from China

1481
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:03,800
Telecom yes and this is our first time

1482
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:06,740
to present our internship in management

1483
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,490
framework Trapster and I want to say

1484
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:12,469
that the items and the technologies will

1485
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:17,389
be updated according to the working

1486
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:20,330
groups decision like for example our

1487
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:23,690
extractor later we will update all the

1488
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:33,970
terms and the terminologies and that's

1489
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:38,450
the brief exercise please yes thank you

1490
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:41,720
okay this documentaries we are at the

1491
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:46,160
premium to describe this framework so

1492
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:49,160
our chapter zero vision have proposed

1493
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:54,860
our opera from framework of the

1494
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:56,960
intangible framework and we also defined

1495
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:59,299
some sample operations including the

1496
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:04,040
intent layer control layer and networks

1497
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:07,370
there and later in the next version we

1498
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:10,340
we hope to add a use case of example for

1499
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:14,950
them pose as the one to show how to work

1500
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:14,950
with this framework next please

1501
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,860
yes this is the open from framework and

1502
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,320
the base clay we have three different

1503
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:26,929
layers in 10 layer control layer and

1504
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,360
that's a network layer so the intent the

1505
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:33,440
area is what we mostly focused on is

1506
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:35,990
it's in this chart and I will describe

1507
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:39,349
briefly about how to work in this

1508
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:41,389
framework so when the requester friends

1509
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:44,570
are a player including for example

1510
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:47,120
operator the user or application right

1511
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:49,880
the cistern the intended management

1512
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,300
module this module will first a collect

1513
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:55,850
the intent request and map out

1514
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:59,330
appropriate policy including

1515
01:13:55,850 --> 01:14:01,550
using the translation module and also

1516
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:04,070
verifying and also verify the

1517
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:07,190
correctness of the configuration and

1518
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:09,950
then sorry previous the last night and

1519
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:11,690
then the decision module with deploys a

1520
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:14,630
configuration through the control layer

1521
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:17,089
automatically so when the configuration

1522
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:20,170
is excuted in the network the

1523
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:22,970
verification module should verify the

1524
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:25,460
validity of the configuration

1525
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:28,400
complimentary based on real-time status

1526
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:30,800
so the effect needs of the configuration

1527
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,280
can be constantly monitored to ensure

1528
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:38,239
the user's intent ism effectively

1529
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:41,090
proceeded but when an unexpected street

1530
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:43,209
using encountered the decision module

1531
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:47,060
can provide feedback and tangle-free

1532
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:51,220
dynamically to the user so this is very

1533
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:54,580
complete a life cycle yes this is the

1534
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:57,680
management module in this intended there

1535
01:14:54,580 --> 01:15:02,330
the management module will mainly have

1536
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,980
three functionalities first it will it

1537
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:06,230
will receive the intent of friends a

1538
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:08,929
player and it will verify and the

1539
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:11,089
classify the intent so if the Internet

1540
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:12,800
is valid it doesn't intend will be

1541
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:19,510
passed to the translation module

1542
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:22,280
so here the classification function will

1543
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:27,010
will do something like the

1544
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:30,889
classification in previous draft in will

1545
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:33,980
present present yet also the man from

1546
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:37,300
the module will need to interact with

1547
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:39,919
the decision module and may receive some

1548
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:41,660
for the horn active feedback from the

1549
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:46,820
teasing module when the configuration

1550
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:49,639
security did not work correctly and the

1551
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:52,219
management module will also need to

1552
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:56,480
regulate the life cycle of the intend

1553
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:59,450
month so this is a closed loop they will

1554
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:04,750
update it or will cross the loop ok next

1555
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:08,550
the peace thank you

1556
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:10,600
the priests against this is the

1557
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:12,610
translation module the tongue

1558
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:14,820
translation model need to analyze as a

1559
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:16,929
semantics of the intent and the

1560
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:20,019
formulate of the corresponding

1561
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:23,910
configuration and the outcome of the

1562
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:29,230
configuration plan to the verification

1563
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:31,300
module so the configuration module also

1564
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:33,370
need to translate and the Spirit is a

1565
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:39,130
somatic continuing in the intensity

1566
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:42,910
month and also maybe a I can also help

1567
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:46,320
to reference for the translation module

1568
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:46,320
okay next please

1569
01:16:47,730 --> 01:17:02,040
okay next please thank you not next to

1570
01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:04,540
priests okay the verification module yes

1571
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,680
the verification module may not have

1572
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:10,690
tool functionalities the first is to

1573
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:12,730
verify whether the configuration can be

1574
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:13,570
executed in the actual network

1575
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:16,599
environment

1576
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:20,889
it worked elector some real-time network

1577
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:22,870
of Staters and then provide relevant

1578
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:26,770
information to the decision module of

1579
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:30,940
feedback and another see is it will

1580
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:33,040
validate a verification when the

1581
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:35,349
configuration is actually actually is

1582
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:38,380
killed yet the network state has a name

1583
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:41,080
may not change as expected so it is

1584
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,000
necessary to verify whether the

1585
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:47,380
execution of the configuration works out

1586
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,450
as expected so network is done dynamics

1587
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:52,510
are changing so the network of

1588
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:55,809
verification should be continuous in in

1589
01:17:52,510 --> 01:18:05,110
real time yes this is the verification

1590
01:17:55,810 --> 01:18:07,360
module so next please next next okay

1591
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:12,780
next please yes yes thank you

1592
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:15,400
next is a t3 module or as I've just

1593
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:17,380
described the district module can

1594
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,280
proceed the data received from the

1595
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:20,530
verification mode

1596
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:22,349
in the decide whether the configuration

1597
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:24,429
can be delivered to the country layer

1598
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:27,730
actually that control layer is a

1599
01:18:24,429 --> 01:18:31,480
traditional some controllers or network

1600
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:34,000
management system it can deliver the

1601
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:36,789
configuration to the network element

1602
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,559
automatically so the physical module

1603
01:18:36,789 --> 01:18:43,539
will decide whether to configure it or

1604
01:18:38,559 --> 01:18:46,300
not and when the users internally is not

1605
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:48,940
implemented or the network status is

1606
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:51,159
kaity and normal so the district module

1607
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,619
also need to notify the intended

1608
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:56,710
management module and the translation

1609
01:18:53,619 --> 01:19:03,909
module to make response so this is a TCP

1610
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:07,829
module ok the next piece say laughter

1611
01:19:03,909 --> 01:19:14,009
modular in intend more intended layer is

1612
01:19:07,829 --> 01:19:16,058
intended repository it will maintain

1613
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:19,599
maintenance or mapping between the

1614
01:19:16,059 --> 01:19:24,070
intent and the configuration and so it

1615
01:19:19,599 --> 01:19:26,099
will also interact with this long

1616
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:30,009
station module and mapping between

1617
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:32,380
mapping between different different

1618
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:34,300
intent and the country read means told

1619
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:41,380
it to have translation module work

1620
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:43,329
correctly ok next piece the last tour is

1621
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:46,840
the control layer and the network layer

1622
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:50,500
so the controller mainly deliver the

1623
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:52,869
country reaching requested to the

1624
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:55,659
network layer and the network layer and

1625
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:59,170
it were also collected Network theaters

1626
01:19:55,659 --> 01:20:01,509
and they reported it to the fabrication

1627
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:03,820
the earth so this is the overall

1628
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:08,579
framework and the work we have think

1629
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:08,579
counter rate and next please

1630
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:26,240
next apiece so the last word last slide

1631
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:29,990
yeah so for the next step because it is

1632
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:33,230
our first thing in initial a document

1633
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:35,780
and the in the next time we we hope to

1634
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:38,209
added some use cases and the intending

1635
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:41,000
examples to show how to work this in

1636
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:42,590
this framework and also we have gathered

1637
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,460
some offline comments and we were

1638
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:50,360
updated in the next ability and we also

1639
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:52,850
hope you can join us and if you ask more

1640
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,610
feedback and more comments and to

1641
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:57,920
improve the document especially I'm

1642
01:20:55,610 --> 01:21:01,190
intending examples will you try to

1643
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,860
define the interfaces modules and the

1644
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:07,610
service model the internal model and the

1645
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:11,920
device model into the framework so this

1646
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:11,920
is my presentation thank you

1647
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:23,559
very quick question although I would

1648
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,560
even prefer itself questions yeah

1649
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:44,620
[Music]

1650
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:47,320
okay I will just give summary of the

1651
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:53,410
activities we are doing around in regard

1652
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:56,950
to AI for network management so in the

1653
01:21:53,410 --> 01:22:01,180
main animal Jesus unit ITF 100 in

1654
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:05,860
Singapore we began this activity this is

1655
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:08,950
in initiative to involve more deeply AI

1656
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:12,639
into network management we had a good 9

1657
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:15,670
stone at IDF one fallen product and we

1658
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:18,310
continued that with the 20 meetings when

1659
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:21,220
we achieved some advancement the

1660
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:22,990
incorporation of advanced AI external in

1661
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:25,720
considerations on intelligent reasoning

1662
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:29,590
and in parallel we started an int with a

1663
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:32,020
challenge project it is really different

1664
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:34,810
approach we are trying to attract

1665
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:38,200
different committees from from AI and

1666
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:40,060
network management in order to exploit

1667
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:43,990
as much as possible this this

1668
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:46,030
possibility so mainly in this challenge

1669
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:48,099
we are looking for right now we are

1670
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:49,450
looking for data sets on use cases so if

1671
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:53,260
anybody is interested in participating

1672
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:56,290
the million or even the execute you know

1673
01:22:53,260 --> 01:23:00,190
that the assistant to this challenge

1674
01:22:56,290 --> 01:23:05,710
please contact us mainly list we are

1675
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:09,969
welcome so apart from that we had a side

1676
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:13,540
meeting in this week and we did a quick

1677
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:16,900
overview of activities and it's a Eni

1678
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:19,960
and they and how they are related to

1679
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:22,450
this AI enhancement so we have this

1680
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:24,820
evolution from the human based to a a

1681
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:28,389
based operation so it is being real

1682
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:31,900
right now also in Etsy so several

1683
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:33,670
reference points were being specified so

1684
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,170
the net knowledge management context

1685
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:37,750
management cognition management

1686
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:39,400
situation awareness very important and

1687
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:42,810
model driven engineering and policy

1688
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:45,280
management of course so the requirements

1689
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:47,320
for this integration are mainly the

1690
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,700
normalization and the normalization of

1691
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:52,780
this

1692
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:55,450
information on intelligence and several

1693
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:58,300
prefer conscious were presented so we

1694
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:59,970
have in general 21 use cases in five

1695
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:04,900
categories including management

1696
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:06,880
operation etc and the we have as

1697
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,769
presented before by will we have

1698
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,900
different categories Asia Network

1699
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:15,100
intelligences similar to the concept of

1700
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:17,200
ultimate self driving and in general we

1701
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:20,740
are also working toward the prediction

1702
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:23,200
of usual computing that is very

1703
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:26,769
important for IOT especially when the

1704
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:31,900
things know we want to offload some work

1705
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:34,210
from the device to the H or cloud so

1706
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:37,000
it's very important to involve AI here

1707
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:38,980
and in general we are discussing on the

1708
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,290
interface and scheme of AI components to

1709
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,820
network component so we are in

1710
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:44,920
discussion with model training and

1711
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:50,650
collaboration at bend or an operation

1712
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:54,730
side I think that's it for now any

1713
01:24:50,650 --> 01:25:02,170
questioning our business so I will give

1714
01:24:54,730 --> 01:25:08,469
some quick updates on and this is that

1715
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:09,900
ISA this one yeah I think it's next

1716
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:14,170
please

1717
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:16,710
yeah so in regarding the intelligent

1718
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:21,670
reasoning and in it is involvement in

1719
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:24,220
the AI for nervous management in the

1720
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:25,840
this lab last update we will work it

1721
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:29,230
from the inner application of AI to

1722
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,390
network management so we are researching

1723
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:34,179
to what they how can we step forward

1724
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:38,200
beyond current machine learning tools

1725
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:40,150
how soon AI be introduced fully

1726
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:43,240
introduced into network management

1727
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:45,339
how would a I be really exploited for

1728
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:48,130
network management that's the key

1729
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:51,040
questions we are trying to to address in

1730
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:54,220
this draft and also we remarked the

1731
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:56,890
importance of external events so we have

1732
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:59,350
for example with the definition of the

1733
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,900
control plane that is focused totally on

1734
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:02,880
the network itself but

1735
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:05,309
we can we also have the management play

1736
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,260
but it done apart from the network it

1737
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:11,420
can also watch the environment of the

1738
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:13,350
network in order to see what events are

1739
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:17,130
important for the behavior of the

1740
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:20,179
network and react to them so in order to

1741
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:22,710
do that we are proposing to exploit

1742
01:26:20,179 --> 01:26:25,170
intelligent reasoning that can reason

1743
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:28,130
they required management actions from

1744
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:31,440
this kind of events i am esmi business

1745
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:32,489
so i in this update we also introduced

1746
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,009
the mingotts

1747
01:26:32,489 --> 01:26:36,839
and issues that we are finding here that

1748
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:39,179
that different providers and vendors

1749
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:42,750
must be able to echo access so we need

1750
01:26:39,179 --> 01:26:47,100
the methods to work together directly or

1751
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:50,610
by means of translator but we use the

1752
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:52,890
same concept so we need to agree on some

1753
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:54,980
common ontology they come said that that

1754
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:58,170
will be working together in this

1755
01:26:54,980 --> 01:27:02,580
reasoning and AI application we have

1756
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:04,440
also to to step forward in the

1757
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:07,290
information retrieval that must be a

1758
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:09,330
system quality for for the output from

1759
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:12,140
their reasoning so it's very important

1760
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:15,600
to assess and to ensure that some

1761
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:18,659
company is using some solution to be

1762
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:23,010
sure what's the quality of the of the

1763
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:24,599
solutions decision so in that sense also

1764
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:27,000
ontological conscience must be

1765
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,949
consistent to the types and qualities of

1766
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,320
information that I mentioned before and

1767
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:33,870
the protocols used to communicate they

1768
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:39,299
must be also compatible to each other

1769
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:41,940
and also I have begun the word in this

1770
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:49,770
draft to relate to other activities so

1771
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:53,000
for example the Ani from HC so the

1772
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:55,620
intention here with this animal is to

1773
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,469
refine the design principle for this

1774
01:27:55,620 --> 01:28:00,809
automated Neutron management solution so

1775
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:02,429
extending the management plane to events

1776
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:04,020
as I have mentioned before that I'll

1777
01:28:02,429 --> 01:28:05,370
cream me on the boundaries of the

1778
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,199
management network but in the

1779
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:08,229
environment and that important for that

1780
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:11,659
network

1781
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:13,969
so we need also to formalize formats for

1782
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:16,999
the management of that data information

1783
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:20,899
knowledge and wisdom within and outside

1784
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:22,938
the database that is exchanging this

1785
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:25,669
information and cooperating with other

1786
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:29,840
activities like Etsy

1787
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:35,260
Eni that will also include limited

1788
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:37,610
information together with this AI

1789
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:39,110
solution and in coordination with the

1790
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:40,969
formalization for example of the

1791
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:44,989
formulation of intent that is being

1792
01:28:40,969 --> 01:28:47,329
discussed before so in general what I we

1793
01:28:44,989 --> 01:28:52,728
want to call to the animatic community

1794
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:55,340
in order to support an enroll with us to

1795
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:56,899
the design and validation of this

1796
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:59,559
information including the protocols of

1797
01:28:56,899 --> 01:29:02,510
interfaces to exchange of this

1798
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:04,729
intelligence information so if anybody

1799
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:09,189
is interested please they go I know you

1800
01:29:04,729 --> 01:29:13,280
are interested so please enjoy nothing

1801
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:15,349
no no yes I'm interested but I think

1802
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:18,070
there are two things one is from the

1803
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:23,320
previous slides that I wear to make a

1804
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:25,999
comment and that is is about the term

1805
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:30,558
intelligent reasoning is what yes

1806
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:32,090
intelligent reasoning I mean if I have

1807
01:29:30,559 --> 01:29:33,829
understood the world what you were

1808
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:35,570
saying this is something that in other

1809
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:41,679
cases I have seen referred as

1810
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:44,629
intelligibility or traceability of the

1811
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:46,309
AI I mean because it is about

1812
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:49,249
understanding why things are something

1813
01:29:46,309 --> 01:29:51,260
right for example this is not an

1814
01:29:49,249 --> 01:29:53,749
intelligent reasoning you don't demand

1815
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:56,389
that the thing is intelligent or that

1816
01:29:53,749 --> 01:29:58,129
reasons is that that it tells you why

1817
01:29:56,389 --> 01:29:59,929
things are tapping it's more about

1818
01:29:58,129 --> 01:30:03,530
traceability or intelligibility more

1819
01:29:59,929 --> 01:30:04,969
than unreasoning the idea is to do both

1820
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:08,209
things at the same time work with use

1821
01:30:04,969 --> 01:30:10,189
yeah yeah what we do is why why I mean

1822
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:12,559
if I if I had something that this is

1823
01:30:10,189 --> 01:30:14,479
exacting in an intelligent way yeah I

1824
01:30:12,559 --> 01:30:19,119
don't want to reason I wanted to inform

1825
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:19,119
me which is not

1826
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,930
course you have but for example when you

1827
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:27,390
are assessing that thing that is telling

1828
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:31,890
you what to do if you are assessing that

1829
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:35,100
thing assessing the quality if something

1830
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:37,350
is going not wrong or wrong or not

1831
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:39,960
optimal you want to know what is

1832
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:42,120
happening so that's exactly but this is

1833
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:46,140
not about the thing reasoning is my

1834
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:49,099
point is that I mean if my my point is

1835
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:54,870
that in general I am I am a police

1836
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:57,480
general in the field people is which is

1837
01:30:54,870 --> 01:31:00,650
the name humanizing too much there is

1838
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,650
the things we are dealing with okay

1839
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:07,590
release no no I know I remote

1840
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:09,870
participants okay no I'm simply simply

1841
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:12,630
one thing is when you were talking about

1842
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:14,160
the data sets etc yeah the position of

1843
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:15,840
contributing it but they think we need

1844
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,300
something else which is about we have to

1845
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,570
define the metadata for those data sets

1846
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,920
that is how we define here yeah jogging

1847
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:25,110
jogging this could be an interesting

1848
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:30,000
goal for the yet so please contribute

1849
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:32,580
that thank you for your participation

1850
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,520
especially the last session of the first

1851
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:37,530
day I've seen from the presentation and

1852
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,530
also from the very good comments that we

1853
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:45,630
are a lot of work right now first I will

1854
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:49,320
really invite you know the the order

1855
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:51,510
that may come and Jeff bring them to the

1856
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,099
offers or to the meaning list it will be

1857
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:55,380
very useful if you can write it down

1858
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:57,950
because this is something we can much

1859
01:31:55,380 --> 01:32:01,050
more easier easily exploit afterwards

1860
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:02,490
and also I invite you to continue being

1861
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:04,230
active in the research group I think

1862
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:09,030
what the point you are mentioning can

1863
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:10,950
really make us concentrate on key

1864
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:13,950
enablers key functionality we need to

1865
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:16,950
deliver to really make this in turn

1866
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:17,370
basic working more or really key that it

1867
