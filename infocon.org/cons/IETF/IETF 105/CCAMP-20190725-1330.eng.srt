00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:21,799
on session but we have two hours so you

13
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:28,880
can also you know download the slides

14

17
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,679
hours I think we have much more time for

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,310
on tip discussion so please take your

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,930
time or even slowly and please enjoy

20
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:56,630

21
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:59,000
agenda hope everything's okay yeah so as

22

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,080
please you know as big in front of the

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:08,179
mic and state your name before speaking

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,728
so the chairs are in the meeting echo

26
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,280
and wave your monitor if there are some

27
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,720
comments from there are remote

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,819
participants and for the minions

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,359
actually are it will be much appreciated

30
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:26,208
if anyone could take some minutes

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,540
I mean key points also they use a pad

32
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,189
and I because you know our circular geo

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,560
sky it's not clear I would like to ask

34
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:37,090
how many anon to help us to capture some

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,090
key points okay thank you

36
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:44,290
so for ip-ah ip-ah you know i it's quite

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,640
very important and we have to follow the

38
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,760
IPA policy on United so you know that if

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,779
a job to moving to the next step in you

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,629
know process we you know other cheers we

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,970
are send out IP upholding for example

42
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,370
before an individual job becomes a

43
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,950
working group document or a bottom group

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,430
document you know goes to last call and

45
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,010
so in this case the author's or the

46
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,500
contributors you know are are required

47
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,200
to provide IP upholding as soon as

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:24,069
possible otherwise it will delay your

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:27,310
chart so you know for the list as always

50
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:30,250
we encourage people to use the list as

51
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,319
much as possible especially we encourage

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,290
people on to discuss especially the

53
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,349
technical staff on the list actively so

54
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:41,168
for example we could you know discuss

55
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,909
any open issues on the list or even you

56
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,629
know for example I introduced some new

57
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:50,620
jobs or you know some potential topics

58
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:53,138
on the list so another important with

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,930
Munder it's that you know what include

60
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,120
consensus it is determined on the list

61
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,359
rather than you know I in this

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,060
face-to-face meeting even so if we carry

63
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,879
some consensus here we were you know

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:18,579
ostia need to print to the list you know

65
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:22,150
for the wider discussion let's move on

66
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,300
with an update on the status of the

67
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,870
working group so since last meeting we

68
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,280
have a newer of C which is the data

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,409
model for microwave radio links so

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,530
microwave work is progressing it by 12

71
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:42,610
we have now another C for the framework

72
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:46,179
and RFC for radio a big young model of

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,520
the radio link and we are now in order

74
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,690
to conclude this work we are still

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,890
missing adjust

76
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,320
the topology document which is by the

77
00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:00,419
way progressing quite well we also have

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,960
two documents in the editor tube DLR

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:09,520
medulla and the RSVP T bandwidth

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:12,489
availability I if I cannot remember the

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,310
bandwidth availability is just waiting

82
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,480
on the approval on on one author the

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,760
last one yellow module we are discussing

84
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,150
writing writing these days some comments

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:33,630
from the RFC editor which should be

86
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:36,159
fixed in a matter of days working group

87
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:41,380
documents adopted the since last meeting

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,720
up a lot of lemma so we have been you

89
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,510
cannot complain your chairs are lazy

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:51,430
because we have six new working group

91
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:55,570
document since last last meeting mostly

92
00:05:51,430 --> 00:06:00,820
we have the year 0 layer 1 types we

93
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:05,230
agreed to follow the way of working of

94
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:08,080
Tisa well the traffic engineering types

95
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,410
have been a decouple that from from the

96
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,140
topology and a dedicated document has

97
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:19,450
been created for them we do the same

98
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:21,940
every year 0 and a1 types and the last

99
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:25,950
the last one we adopted is the client

100
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:33,160
signal a young model but we have also

101
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:37,539
documents on the WDM interface LMP and

102
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,130
parameter and the new document that we

103
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,440
will see today which is the optical

104
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:47,770
impairment a topology these were these

105
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,740
are the ones that will be discussed that

106
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,320
day for which as lot has been has not be

107
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,620
has been requested well these are the

108
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,830
ones that will not be presented play but

109
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,250
for which we requested an update from

110
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,609
from the others so I'll uh quickly

111
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,850
go through them if the others want to

112
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:14,520
chime in and provide this further info

113
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,780
this is more than welcome

114
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:27,130
mostly for these two because we don't

115
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:30,489
have another date actually we are taking

116
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,800
some other issuance github according to

117
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,760
some offline context is not received

118
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:49,780
from operators and will work according

119
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:51,370
to ok WDM interface LMP the Briella

120
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,719
goethe do you wanted to give us an

121
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,720
update on the way forward

122
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,419
no I don't have any update any

123
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:07,109
modification on the document so I think

124
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:13,810
the sign that is quite stable

125
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:20,710
ok then flex agreed the media channel

126
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:22,390
junga these one has been updated that

127
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,489
reflect the changes that we were

128
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,760
speaking about before the layer 0 layer

129
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:32,020
1 types layer 0 in particular in this

130
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,890
case and some changes regarding the

131
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:39,069
security section and updates to to the

132
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,770
references flexibly the young model

133
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:47,470
again also this one was updated to

134
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:51,970
reflect the let me see to reference the

135
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:54,570
al0 types layer once yes M no update on

136
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,030
that but if a correct remember that was

137
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:02,650
close to us call right it was pretty

138
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:05,980
pretty much stable regarding the name

139
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:09,459
was a service model because we have

140
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,050
newly introduced air one types the solar

141
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,660
in correlation projector knock

142
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,449
but that that's the only pending update

143
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:26,118
difficulty remember right

144
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:30,998
it's no time yet speaking probably is to

145
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:33,739
have a look to the flexibility draft the

146
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:38,869
in order to make them more aligned with

147
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:41,660
ITT last modification rectangle that is

148
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:46,399
a point at which with water

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:50,509
thank you okay then as we said layer 0

150
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:57,160
types eat all you want

151
00:09:50,509 --> 00:10:04,449
okay this has been carved out from the

152
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,449
the young to polish model minor

153
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:09,290
editorial changes are changing the

154
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:13,959
basically flexible flexi it was agreed

155
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:17,059
to use a flexi as as a comment armor and

156
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:20,149
there's a new section on a tea types

157
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:24,019
module contents to specie to specify all

158
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:26,959
grouping and types data please okay I

159
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:32,240
just wanted to mention here that we are

160
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:35,569
actually developing this layers your

161
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:40,759
pipes yang file on our github together

162
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:49,748
with okay so probably we need to turn to

163
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:52,129
the reference okay okay

164
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:55,790
Balaji can you send me a reminder I'll

165
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:59,749
do that thanks microwave topology

166
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:02,149
younger I can also in this case a pretty

167
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:04,610
minor a pretty minor changed changes

168
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,910
moving the microwave bandwidth from T

169
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:10,339
link to T bandwidth introduce the

170
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,790
introduce that the microwave channel

171
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,410
list

172
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,868
I removed the tunnel concept next step

173
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,519
still some work to be done but I would

174
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:21,470
say marijuana so clarify the

175
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,619
applicability of the T topology on a

176
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,690
micro network container definition for

177
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:28,450
microwave

178
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:32,910
in the young model and complete use case

179
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:35,950
details no change on the NBI

180
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,459
applicability statement if a call to

181
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:42,790
remember last time we said it was it was

182
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,820
time a to to to to conclude the workup

183
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,770
basically yes we are doing a detailed

184
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,320
review within the design team we've got

185
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,050
many useful comments from little and

186
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,940
Michael and we should be able to arrest

187
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,920
a vacuum update by September August and

188
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,900
then we will be ready to provoke a new

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,540
Prescott the only pending issue is a

190
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,449
normative references that are most of

191
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,760
them working group documents and one is

192
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:14,280
individual document which are normally

193
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:18,730
work so that's yeah we had this

194
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,209
discussion before this sample we needed

195
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,950
to sort out I mean if those are not much

196
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,670
of reference is there's nothing that we

197
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:31,810
can do the only thing I would say we

198
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:34,300
will go for the last call when when the

199
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:40,089
document is ready there's no need to

200
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:43,180
keep it part until all the references

201
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:46,360
will become will be published probably

202
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:50,050
it will be hold by the RFC editor after

203
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:57,850
after that but at least we will write

204
00:12:50,050 --> 00:13:03,310
everything in stones no big changes on

205
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:07,710
this document the all the only one worth

206
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:10,180
being mentioned is the w.zahn a younger

207
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,390
basically the clarification are related

208
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,949
to the scope of the document

209
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:22,540
and the fact that it only covers the

210
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:27,370
transparent dozen years anti

211
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:32,170
communication as usual pretty pretty

212
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:36,100
intense activity to see camp and the

213
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:38,860
from cecum received a liaison from itu-t

214
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,899
study group of 15

215
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:46,779
whose title is related topic being a

216
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,910
description of the OTS I and the network

217
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,899
media channel this is probably what we

218
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:58,029
will see in our first presentation from

219
00:13:52,899 --> 00:14:01,480
deter and we sent a reagent to any

220
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:09,540
effort on providing an update on our

221
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:13,750
work on l1 service model this is it I

222
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,380
think we are ready to start with the

223
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,380
first presentation

224
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:37,180
good afternoon my name is dieter Beller

225
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:40,450
I am one of the co-authors of this draft

226
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:45,399
providing a young data model for optical

227
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:47,380
impairment over topology as you can see

228
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,410
on this slide there are quite a number

229
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:54,180
of people who are actually contributing

230
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:57,850
to this effort so it's a long list and

231
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,709
we are having weekly meetings open

232
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,260
meetings that have been announced on the

233
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,439
cecum mailing list given the political

234
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,330
circumstances which we have right now so

235
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:12,190
we have a call a weekly call every

236
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:15,760
Thursday for one hour and as you can see

237
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,740
we have a great support from operators

238
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,350
as well as from a variety of different

239
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:25,390
vendors including yep and we also have a

240
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:30,040
github I will come to that later where

241
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:32,589
we actually manage our young files and

242
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:38,949
also manage the open issues which were

243
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:41,290
working on okay next slide the scope of

244
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:45,190
the document is actually to provide a

245
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:47,199
young data model that actually collects

246
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,170
information from the network from the

247
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,930
devices and constructs a topological

248
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,300
view of the network based on the

249
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,420
information that it receives from the

250
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,149
devices and provides a network-wide view

251
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:05,680
of the network topology from layer 0 for

252
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:09,190
a WDM network to be more precise we have

253
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,930
and this is the picture that's in the

254
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:17,260
document you can see here just you can

255
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:22,050
see here's the devices in the network

256
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:25,029
for example the optical transponders and

257
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,279
also the optical line system segment so

258
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,320
this is just a small piece of the

259
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,250
network and there could be of course

260
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,770
also rodents in this network the

261
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,320
interface or the network is controlled

262
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,790
by an optical domain controller so that

263
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,829
the main controller controls all the

264
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,599
devices in the network including optical

265
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:48,819
transformers rodents optical amplifiers

266
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,050
and so all the other network elements in

267
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,329
the network are controlled by this

268
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,130
controller and the control actually

269
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,258
collects the information regarding the

270
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,110
topology and provides this topology

271
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:02,259
information to a client which can be a

272
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,540
multi domain service controller or it

273
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:07,089
could be a PC element that directly has

274
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,639
access to the optical network controller

275
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,500
in order to retrieve the topology it's

276
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,689
important to note that the the

277
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,859
information is a read-only information

278
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,439
because the information is just

279
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:19,540
collected from the network we're not

280
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,929
intending to use this model to control

281
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,938
the network so and you can see here this

282
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,030
is this the the interface that were

283
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:31,840
targeting where the topology information

284
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:34,030
can be retrieved and we have four device

285
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,520
configuration a separate interface and

286
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,129
there is a separate draft that a young

287
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,299
model for the interface configuration

288
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,380
that's actually complementing this

289
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:49,780
topology yang model for configuring the

290
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:56,169
network elements as already mentioned we

291
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:58,178
have splits off or end off the type

292
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,490
definitions that we need for this later

293
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,309
is your topology and all the groupings

294
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,159
that we have defined that are used to

295
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:08,230
describe the layer zero topology and the

296
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,480
optical impairments so that's in a

297
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,330
separate di module and that layer zero

298
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,299
types yang file that should be imported

299
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,730
not only by the topology yang model but

300
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,290
also by the interface yang model so

301
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,200
we're trying to get everything pretty

302
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,840
much aligned to make sure that well what

303
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,240
has what can be retrieved using this

304
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,100
topology yang model and what can't can

305
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,650
be can be configured using the device

306
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:38,980
model is consistent and this is the

307
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:42,549
reference architecture also an ASCII art

308
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,760
picture from the document you can see

309
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:47,830
here we have for example the Rotom

310
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,780
device the rodent devices can be

311
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,960
decomposed into an ingress or

312
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,000
amplifier it has a switching fabric a

313
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,180
photonic switching fabric to switch

314
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,640
optical channels or media channels from

315
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,430
one side to the other side and it also

316
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,880
has an add/drop lock where you connect

317
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:10,250
the optical transponders where signals

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,020
photonic signals can be terminated or

319
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:18,200
generated and of course between the

320
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,320
rodents we have the OTS link and the OMS

321
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,720
link as defined by the itu-t

322
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,030
recommendations and this we have

323
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,950
currently a very fairly detailed model

324
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:33,410
of the OMS link that is a series of

325
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:37,550
elements like fibers light in-line

326
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:40,100
amplifiers we even have introduced four

327
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,050
connectors an insertion loss that can be

328
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,149
configured or that can be retrieved from

329
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:47,840
the network so we have a fairly detailed

330
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,670
model already for the OMS link what is

331
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,540
still missing and what we're still

332
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:57,350
working on is to define a model for the

333
00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:00,260
optical transponders and we also figure

334
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:03,139
out that we need to define a model for

335
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,700
three our generators so that's still

336
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,830
something that's outstanding and we have

337
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,160
created issues on our github for that to

338
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,710
address those issues and refine the

339
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,490
modeler to also include elements for

340
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:21,590
three our generators as well as optical

341
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:24,890
impairments for the rodents okay major

342
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,620
changes since the previous IETF on a 104

343
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,510
meeting yeah as you have seen there are

344
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,129
a lot of contributors or co-authors we

345
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,900
had a lot of long list of co-authors on

346
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,310
the title page and of course this does

347
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:40,820
not meet the rules of the IETF so we had

348
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,590
to select a few co-authors that we put

349
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,889
on the title page and then we moved all

350
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,810
the other contributors further down in

351
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:52,120
the document we also updated the

352
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:54,950
reference documents we replaced the

353
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,239
figures that we have used in our

354
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,760
previous discussions which were

355
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,210
PowerPoint slides with ASCII art figures

356
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,060
so

357
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,940
and we had a we added also then the

358
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,129
definition of what we call here a media

359
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,400
channel and a media channel group the

360
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,300
media channel is also defined in the new

361
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,300
IQ t or accomodation G 807 and I'll come

362
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,830
to that in a minute the media channel

363
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,720
group is something that we define in

364
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,179
order to group multiple media channels

365
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,730
together in case inverse multiplexing

366
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:30,230
issues that means it's for example if a

367
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:33,830
400 gig client signal has to be carried

368
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,510
using multiple carriers that carries a

369
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:41,550
fraction of the client signal like for

370
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:44,430
example 4 times 100 gig then it's of

371
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:47,450
course the objective to put all the four

372
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,770
carriers into a single media channel if

373
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,720
spectrum availability doesn't allow that

374
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:55,860
end-to-end and of course we have to

375
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,600
split the other signals and carry them

376
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,459
across multiple media channels and

377
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,550
therefore we have created this media

378
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:07,170
channel group concept we also had quite

379
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,950
some discussion regarding the

380
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:13,320
interpretation of the OTS a definition

381
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,800
that is defined in the ITT

382
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,500
recommendation g95 9.1 and the OTS I

383
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,320
signal OTS I group which is a grouping

384
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,280
of OTS I signal that's defined in the

385
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,710
new recommendation G 807 and of course

386
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,110
we are currently reviewing also all the

387
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,650
new parameters that we have added and

388
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,689
for the error element for the optical

389
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,700
transponders as well as optical and

390
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,950
parent parameters on the line as well as

391
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:46,680
for the for the road and says something

392
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:50,700
that we still have to work on so based

393
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:54,090
on the side meeting that we had back in

394
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,300
Prague we had a lock a long discussion

395
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,939
how to interpret the definitions in the

396
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,270
itu-t recommendations that define the

397
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,310
data plane specifically in itu-t

398
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,010
recommendation nine five-niner-one it

399
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:10,379
says that the OTS i can be a signal

400
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,690
which can be composed of a single

401
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,920
optical module a single modulated

402
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,460
optical carrier

403
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,590
can be a signal of multiple modulated

404
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,960
optical carriers and so we had we were

405
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,780
struggling with that definition and we

406
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,290
actually put together a contribution to

407
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,930
the study group 50 meeting that was held

408
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:34,080
beginning of July in Geneva where we

409
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:37,500
actually said well we are assuming for

410
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,649
our topology yang model data no TSI only

411
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,780
consists of a single modulated optical

412
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,230
carrier and we proposed to actually

413
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,889
clarify that definition in 95 9.1 to

414
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,570
only cover that case and to remove that

415
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,780
that it may also contain multiple

416
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:57,929
optical carriers unfortunately this

417
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,879
proposal has been rejected but study

418
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,430
group 15 had some discussions during

419
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,010
that meeting and they agreed that they

420
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:10,200
want added some clarification into G 807

421
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,120
however we had also during the

422
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,220
discussion and in the meeting that we

423
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,780
had yesterday we still figure out that

424
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,170
there is still some clarification

425
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,990
required the G 807 is a new

426
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:25,020
recommendation that's currently under or

427
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:28,050
for which the AAP a last call process

428
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,150
will be starts started soon and we

429
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:35,010
agreed that we will have to prepare some

430
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:37,830
lascall comments on that document and we

431
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:40,500
will coronate that also in the upcoming

432
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,290
meetings of this or the group of people

433
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,770
that are working together on this draft

434
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:54,240
to submit these comments and to study

435
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:56,670
could 15 okay this is actually the

436
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,250
feedback that we've gotten from study

437
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:03,110
group 15 regarding our contribution so

438
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:07,260
as I said they rejected the proposal and

439
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:11,570
added some clarifying text to 807 which

440
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,570
we still believe is not clear enough and

441
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,700
the issue is actually that they define

442
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,409
what they call a network mediate show

443
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,150
and the network media channel still has

444
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:24,540
some restrictions which make it

445
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,400
difficult to actually optimize spectrum

446
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,830
utilization so that's the point that we

447
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:37,070
will have to clarify in this

448
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:39,409
and that aap last call on 807 okay based

449
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:43,220
on the feedback that we got in that

450
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,910
liaison letter that has mentioned a few

451
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,390
minutes ago

452
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:49,880
I think our model is still valid and I

453
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,350
think we can actually we believe that we

454
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,410
can move forward with what our

455
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,899
assumptions are so we believe that the

456
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,150
current yang model is aligned with G 807

457
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,430
and are the assumptions that we have

458
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:04,690
taken in our drives is that as I said

459
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:08,390
that the no TSI only has a single

460
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,340
modulated optical carrier and we also

461
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,970
allow the freedom that the frequency of

462
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:17,060
that optical carrier may not or beyond

463
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,700
the ITT grid that allows us actually to

464
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,700
squeeze multiple carriers together into

465
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:27,080
a media channel to optimize spectrum

466
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:30,950
utilization and a media channel can

467
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:34,100
contain multiple OTS I so for the

468
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,230
purpose of optimizing this spectrum in

469
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,740
case inverse multiplexing is used and

470
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:43,370
all these arm ltsi that are belonging to

471
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,310
a single out TSI group have to be

472
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,860
corroded so therefore the requirement

473
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:52,090
from our side is that network has to

474
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:55,969
provide a pipe and to end from A to Z

475
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:58,879
crossing multiple rodents over the media

476
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:01,640
channel of the same sizes is switched in

477
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,850
the switching fabric or in the WSS

478
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,760
switching matrix and such that we get an

479
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,500
end-to-end pipe for that contains all

480
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
the OTS is belonging to the same

481
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,420
virtuous I group so that's a type of the

482
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:20,179
same size from A to Z that carries all

483
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:22,640
these signals okay as I said we still

484
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,010
have to work together with the itu-t

485
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,410
study group 15 to clarify these issues

486
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,920
and as I said we will we are going to

487
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:34,610
coordinate and send some last aap last

488
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:38,909
call comments on 8 to 7 and this is the

489
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:43,340
yang at the preview of our apology yang

490
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:47,429
a model we have currently on our github

491
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:51,860
it augments the tea topology yang model

492
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:54,960
so it's augmenting for example the te

493
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,590
link attributes here are a number of

494
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:02,789
attributes that are listed so for the

495
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:05,639
OMS line for example we defined

496
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:12,570
generalized way there are some power

497
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:15,029
parameters then the the media channel

498
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:21,269
group and the media channels inside the

499
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:24,240
media channel group we also for the OMS

500
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:28,350
line we define the elements along the

501
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:31,830
link from one rhythm to the neighbor

502
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:35,519
Rotom so that those elements could be an

503
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,710
amplifier could be a piece of fiber and

504
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,740
could also be a concentrate it also

505
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:45,769
which is introduced to it due to a patch

506
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:48,210
panel or some connectors and the other

507
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:50,720
orientation that we have defined so far

508
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,570
is for the termination point the

509
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,980
attributes that are related to the

510
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:59,039
transmitter and receiver in the optical

511
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,679
transformer that defines for example the

512
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,899
either a standard mode in which the

513
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,740
opera the optical transponder is

514
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:12,479
operated or an operational mode that's

515
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,279
defined by the vendor or the third

516
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,039
option is actually to explicitly

517
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,970
configure the optical transponder

518
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:25,259
attributes like the modulation format

519
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:28,110
the the baud rate the forward error

520
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:34,230
correction that's that's being used by

521
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:37,879
the transponder yeah we are we have it

522
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:40,919
github we're using github to actually

523
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:42,570
develop our yang model our game file and

524
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,789
there are a number of issues there and

525
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,668
everybody has access to this github and

526
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:50,010
can actually create issues or submit

527
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:51,210
pull requests in case he's proposing

528
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,610
some changes

529
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:58,080
which we are then reviewing together and

530
00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:01,169
then we're if the changes are okay we're

531
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,990
accepting that them and then move on

532
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:08,280
please have a look this is the link to

533
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:12,750
the github it's also I think available

534
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:15,240
on data tracker or our layer 0 at

535
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,980
apology young model so if you go to the

536
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,850
CQM page you find also the link to the

537
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:24,540
github there currently we have or we we

538
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:27,629
had 24 issues up to now 12 are closed

539
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:30,090
and the remaining 12 are still working

540
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,060
progress the most important issues that

541
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,790
we're currently addressing is we need to

542
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,879
define what the OT SI capabilities or

543
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:41,460
the transponder camp capabilities are so

544
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,000
all the operational modes and the

545
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,900
configuration that possibilities the

546
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,060
optical transport provides have to be

547
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:54,930
defined and have to be retrieved in

548
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:58,500
order to support path computation in a

549
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:01,920
on the topology because when you create

550
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,620
a new service from A to Z of course the

551
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,710
Tewa transformers at the end the list of

552
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:10,050
the photonic connection have to share

553
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,990
have some capabilities in common

554
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,750
otherwise the traffic or the connection

555
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,220
doesn't work so in order to make sure

556
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,840
that we have to list all the

557
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,940
capabilities that the two end

558
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,610
transformers have and also the optical

559
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:29,280
impairment parameters determine to some

560
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,929
extent also the the length of the

561
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,270
connection or how many ops you can

562
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,160
actually cross and those also depend on

563
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,250
the operation mode so that's important

564
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,230
information that has to be provided

565
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,670
before the service is actually

566
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,530
established and then of course the

567
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:47,270
optical transponder has one

568
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:52,590
configuration based on its capabilities

569
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:55,860
we still have to define what optical

570
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:59,100
impairments should be provided in the

571
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,729
model for rodents so when an optical

572
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,949
signal traverses a

573
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,540
we have to define what optical

574
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,760
impairments in terms of crosstalk for

575
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,850
example or other impairments so those

576
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,250
are still missing and the last or one of

577
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:16,409
the other important open issues is the

578
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,090
definition of three origin or ages we

579
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,250
had some discussion yesterday already

580
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,949
there are different types of three

581
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,120
original raters uni-directional

582
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,420
regenerators or b direction are we

583
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,629
generators so these kind of devices that

584
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:35,790
are used in today's network have to be

585
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:39,450
supported by the model next steps of

586
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:43,550
course we will continue our discussion

587
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:49,230
or interactions with the iqt as I said

588
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:51,810
we will have to keep the alignment of

589
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,690
the topology model with the interface

590
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:57,960
model that's going to be presented in a

591
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,810
few minutes by a Gabriela and of course

592
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,990
we'll have to add then also the model

593
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:06,990
for three original raters and manage the

594
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,070
open issues on our github so that's

595
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:13,640
pretty much it

596
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:13,639
regarding this draft questions

597
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:27,820
no question Gabriella actually Gabriela

598
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:32,050
speaking uh sure is not a question but

599
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:35,470
is foundation as when we introduce for

600
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:39,340
example to our generator also the layer

601
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:43,030
layer layer zero type draft should be

602
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,830
updated accordingly and then okay we are

603
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,710
working with your importer of the

604
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:54,060
drafter in order to make a or keep this

605
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:57,100
that draft you see with our okay okay

606
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:01,210
yeah I think that's that's our general

607
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:03,520
strategy that we have one young file

608
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:07,900
that contains the type definitions for

609
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:11,668
Holly zero work including the topology

610
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:14,889
model as well as the interface model yes

611
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:17,500
Tara a single source that's import then

612
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:19,960
into the yang models for for the

613
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,500
interface as well for topology and maybe

614
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,380
there are others just to reinforce again

615
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,649
the message go to the heat up because

616
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,470
indicator actually move over those

617
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:36,639
documents and then you can see how they

618
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:39,668
are aligned and then we make it easy to

619
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:46,239
manage all this stuff and keep all this

620
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:48,969
job synchronized together ok great

621
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,639
thanks so on either and this different

622
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,600
time so I have one comment for

623
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,089
clarification could you go back to your

624
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,189
pager servant

625
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,189
[Music]

626
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:18,640
ok so kitty was fast could you move back

627
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:20,920
to you yeah so on here regarding the

628
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,279
assumptions I think actually are dis

629
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,720
reham assumptions are correct but you

630
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,010
know are based on the itu-t

631
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,769
recommendations it says that OTS I may

632
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:34,900
consist of

633
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:38,049
one thing go our carrier or a group of

634
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,990
carriers or sub carriers so for the

635
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:45,160
first item is cracked but I'm not sure

636
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:49,240
on my question is that if your model can

637
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:54,730
support OTS I consists of you know a

638
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:56,470
group of carriers or sub carriers yeah

639
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,480
we deliberately did not want to have

640
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,939
that because we believe that it's

641
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,410
sufficient to have an OTA Seiichi that

642
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:07,599
can contain multiple OTS eyes so and to

643
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:10,750
have a second level of inverse

644
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,329
multiplexing and that was the message of

645
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:17,079
the the proposal or the justification in

646
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:18,759
the itu-t kharak contribution we do

647
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,470
believe that this over complicates the

648
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:26,230
management of the WDM network yeah I

649
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,328
know you you know purpose of you and you

650
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,890
know a contribution to ITT but you know

651
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:33,579
this contribution of lopata was

652
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:36,460
protected you know I hate UT I mean so

653
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:39,220
because we have actually we don't define

654
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,690
data slam technologists usually from the

655
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,660
conscious land perspective we should

656
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:48,789
have followed the ITT you know

657
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:51,308
recommendations so on so if if if we so

658
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,859
in this case if it's it is if not

659
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:56,049
consisted of its itu-t documentation how

660
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:59,200
we can you know handle this issue

661
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,180
because anyway I could keep that not you

662
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,180
know modified the you know definition of

663
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,180
OTS I based on your proposal right

664
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:19,269
that's a good question on the other hand

665
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:21,578
if you look at the optical transponders

666
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:23,618
that are available today I think all the

667
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,829
vendors are actually using a single

668
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:30,940
optelec optical carrier that's modulated

669
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:33,130
to carry digital information so the in

670
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,230
the liaison statement and also in the

671
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,180
information that I received from the ITT

672
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,009
meeting they said in the future there

673
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:44,680
might be other modulation techniques

674
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:45,230
that may use subcarriers but today I

675
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,049
think

676
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,510
such modulation schemes do not exist in

677
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:53,300
in in real networks so therefore I think

678
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,950
we're okay for now and in the future if

679
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:03,170
required we can of course six and

680
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:04,730
remodel just to add to the question in

681
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,580
progress so maybe you can take it to

682
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,890
this later but the itu-t as a term to

683
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,619
refer to cars on we want to talk about

684
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:16,009
blue cars so we agree to reduce the

685
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:18,230
activity term cars to refer to our blue

686
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,869
cars if ya QT want to refer to all the

687
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,030
type of cars we don't combine but our

688
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:26,330
model is just about blue cars are we

689
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:29,060
naming baby blue cards because we want

690
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:31,160
it and I QT term to refer to blue cars

691
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,320
if it doesn't suit you

692
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:38,500
we may come up with a larger but we will

693
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,500
have some discrepancy between

694
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:48,130
terminology we felt it was necessary

695
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,130
because a blue car is gone that's it

696
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:58,580
moreover we are not redefining the

697
00:38:53,030 --> 00:39:02,930
concept of OTS I it can be composed by

698
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:05,779
one or multiple carriers we just support

699
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:10,899
the way of configuring one cabinets

700
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,900
exactly this was the legalese part

701
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,220
modern multiple carriers in ESI

702
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,839
[Laughter]

703
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:40,609
but nothing prevents us to say the SII

704
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,589
can be composed by one or multiple

705
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:51,799
carriers for the moment we define

706
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:55,450
outward I don't see it doesn't probably

707
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,520
be careful when writing in the draft

708
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:02,810
something like don't write we

709
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:06,170
assume that only a single carrier can be

710
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,210
part of any TSI but say something like

711
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,550
not yes I can be composed by single of

712
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,590
multiple carriers within the scope of

713
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,600
this document we are assuming we are

714
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:24,010
considering just the scenario of single

715
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:26,839
carrier entity is that anyway they

716
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:29,600
management entity they control an entity

717
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,420
is a single entity I the fact that is

718
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,610
one or multiple multi carrier does not

719
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,980
matter because the entity that has to be

720
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:39,140
a marriage is del psi and this is a

721
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:54,920
perfectly aligned with what the doctor

722
00:40:39,140 --> 00:41:09,529
is saying okay good morning the

723
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:14,060
covergirl investor speaking okay so this

724
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:17,560
draft is actually complimenting the

725
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:24,100
previous draft described by editor and

726
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:29,690
is working more at the lower level so

727
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:33,380
represent the optical impairment at the

728
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:37,570
interface level so while the previous

729
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:41,900
draft is augmenting the the topology

730
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:46,490
disrupt or the models described in this

731
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:50,270
draft augmented the interface the idea

732
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:55,520
of interface models so that the scope is

733
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:58,009
to give the possibility or expose all

734
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,400
the optical impairments motors and the

735
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:04,880
the way that in interface

736
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,270
DWM interface works to the to the

737
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,270
controller

738
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:20,570
document history is just quite a new

739
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:23,840
working document he has been promoted to

740
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:27,609
two zero zero ration in March so we

741
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:34,030
didn't have any presentation in Dragon

742
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:38,450
AIT f-104 and has been updated in July

743
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:41,150
what has been changed is the regime some

744
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:45,020
parameters that are reflecting better

745
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:49,400
the the meaning of the signal they

746
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,820
represent we added actually two new

747
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,790
parameters one is the BOD rate and the

748
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:59,359
second one is the total input power

749
00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:06,220
received at transceiver then we fix some

750
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:09,380
typos and so so the next step is ok

751
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:15,109
realign the document based on the latest

752
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:21,589
itu-t definition and models work very

753
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:23,598
closed to keep the draft in sync with

754
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:26,359
the optical impairment apology young

755
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:30,770
modest either in terms of terminology

756
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:33,609
and in terms of contents so I remind

757
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:36,920
that these two documents are

758
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:39,259
complementing each other so it's

759
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:45,910
important that they have the same

760
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:48,800
terminology and they don't present any

761
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:53,899
parameter duplication because this would

762
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:58,910
be misleading and so on okay for the

763
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:01,280
last call I think the the fate of this

764
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:04,990
document will follow the fate of the

765
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,869
topology anga document so there is still

766
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,759
quite a lot of work to do because this

767
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:17,450
one will be affected by three our

768
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:20,089
generator and again probably the enhance

769
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:23,368
motivation format study we are going to

770
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:27,400
start again and all the stuff so

771
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:31,930
of course not Astley not asking the

772
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:35,380
Telus coal but I think what what I'm

773
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:39,399
asking is to have a look to the draft

774
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:42,550
and then to provide the feedbacks on the

775
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,849
contents and on the parameters that we

776
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,849
have Maude

777
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:53,859
that's all from my side any question

778
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:57,279
let's get them all I was a holder of

779
00:44:53,859 --> 00:45:00,210
this job that has to clarify so in this

780
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,530
interface model there are also

781
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:06,550
possibility to define different carriers

782
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:08,920
which is to address your your concern we

783
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:12,520
still need to work out how let's it

784
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:16,829
bridge those two drafts together but at

785
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:22,240
least from that perspective we're okay

786
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:24,160
Thanks thank you one comment so do we

787
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,729
think this job needs to be reviewed by

788
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:33,578
young doctors yes that is not yet ready

789
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:37,060
evolving so you mean before then what

790
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:39,119
could last call we senator I'm sorry

791
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,290
young do you think you can manage that

792
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,700
actually I was going to write in the

793
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:48,400
representation but I forgot it just a

794
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:51,700
suggestion would it make sense to also

795
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,040
put that this draft or the yang model of

796
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,859
this craft on to our it up because you

797
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,200
said they go together we could actually

798
00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:02,319
think of putting them on the same get up

799
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,939
and we ensure that they are consistent

800
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,099
and that they were reviewed by that

801
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,490
people who are contributing to this

802
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:20,910
effort absolutely excellent suggestion

803
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:20,910
okay thank you very much thanks Ian next

804
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:38,589
okay this is a hobby come here from

805
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:41,109
Harley and welcome to lair what the

806
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:43,720
first draft is going to be present today

807
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:46,930
it's layer one types which is a new

808
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,328
draft but this is a grading the track

809
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:53,140
meeting to have a common session between

810
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:56,559
the among a few draft including the

811
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:59,170
odeon topology or Tintin oh and also

812
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:03,210
they layer one service model so we

813
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:07,839
generate common types and groupings and

814
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:10,150
put a model in this draft so firstly

815
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:15,660
let's look at what is proposed the model

816
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:19,660
relationship and the motivation is to

817
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:23,788
okay use the same philosophy with what

818
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:28,618
has been done 40 generic model and

819
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:28,619
extract the technology specific model

820
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:35,650
the types with the common types between

821
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:40,450
multiple models so here we just focus on

822
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:45,730
layer 1 and more explicitly odeon common

823
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:49,058
types so this model would be imported by

824
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:51,999
three different modules including the

825
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:55,420
Audion topology OTN danau and the layer

826
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:58,200
1 active the service model and this

827
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:02,140
module itself does not require I had any

828
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:08,109
importing from other models so this can

829
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:11,739
be used as a fundamental one and in this

830
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:14,980
table we just enumerate what has been

831
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:21,249
included in the current layer one types

832
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:23,650
so there are two groups of basic type of

833
00:48:21,249 --> 00:48:26,259
the first way is OD you type and the

834
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,839
second why is client signal so basically

835
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:34,390
audio type is used as a switching type

836
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:35,279
II and we are using we have specified

837
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:41,400
all

838
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:45,210
Audio types list in RFC scented ones 39

839
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:49,020
which is person I to teach it awesome

840
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:55,099
all died and also their RFC 79 63 which

841
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:58,230
is from the treatise at sacrament 43 and

842
00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:02,430
for the client signal we have different

843
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:06,680
granularities for Ethernet STM n OC

844
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:09,839
fibre channel and cycle so we have

845
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:14,730
reference to the cross bonding data

846
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:17,340
playing standard as well and besides the

847
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:20,190
types were also having similar groupings

848
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:24,630
which would be imported by multiple

849
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:27,240
models including basically besides audio

850
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:29,790
type and the client signal we also have

851
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:33,930
the label information bandwidth

852
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:39,109
information and also some encoding

853
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:43,950
functions so from this table shows which

854
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:51,839
model import we or use of which

855
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:56,009
groupings so there is consecutive effort

856
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:58,619
to harmonize also there one models

857
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:02,490
especially for the OTO one and make it a

858
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:05,730
consistent between OTN topology tango

859
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:09,169
and there one connectivity service model

860
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:13,290
and there is also the open issue to

861
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:16,109
check with our FCAT 407 which is a

862
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:21,660
guideline of the young model to avoid

863
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:24,060
annoying mr. patch and after we do that

864
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:28,259
we will repress the further working

865
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:34,589
class go and the end after review so any

866
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:37,230
comments so far regarding the types just

867
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:39,540
comment from a problem let me say

868
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:43,670
process point of view I would say that

869
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:46,050
that now that the flow to be followed in

870
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,690
progress in the work should be

871
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:52,050
types topology and

872
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:55,260
like like the divinities so yes this

873
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:57,359
will be the next billion zero types and

874
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:06,990
the layer one types will be the next in

875
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:10,348
the Python to be moved forward right yep

876
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:14,040
just so the slice is also following this

877
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:15,839
order I believe is attract so after the

878
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,000
types we are going to present to the

879
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,990
audience Apollo young which has been

880
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,270
silent for a while and last time is

881
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:29,939
mantra okay him so so let's reveal the

882
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:32,390
summary of the changes this is now it's

883
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,490
portion number seven but what we

884
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:38,220
compared a is Washington bursaries which

885
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:42,060
is our last presentation in Montreal as

886
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:47,819
well so for this one we have chaff the

887
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:52,230
compliance who is eighty 407 and we

888
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:54,390
corrected a few place to make model

889
00:51:52,230 --> 00:52:00,050
complete and makes a draft all the

890
00:51:54,390 --> 00:52:03,089
sessions with sufficient information and

891
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:07,619
we also changed the model according to

892
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:10,049
some of the issue on the github firstly

893
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:14,310
we added the supported Aquinas signals

894
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:17,550
to indicate the capabilities of the OT

895
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:20,040
node and we also harmonized with the

896
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:25,170
latest he generic model which is now in

897
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,940
the RFC editor queue and basically there

898
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:29,010
are two basic classes the first one is

899
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,140
to add the labels tab information and

900
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,470
for out here in so since it's it's

901
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:38,520
digital once and it's just always set

902
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:40,529
one and we also change the past

903
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:46,520
correspondent pass according to the

904
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:50,579
latest theater polity finally with

905
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:53,849
emergence of layer one types we switch

906
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:58,050
is importing from layer one types

907
00:52:53,849 --> 00:53:01,970
instead of alteon types so this page we

908
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:08,140
give a summary on

909
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:14,930
how we augment each part of the teat

910
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:17,720
apologies to specify the okhane specific

911
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:22,250
characteristics so basically for the

912
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:24,500
attributes we extend the link and did be

913
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,450
a little bit and the first band ways we

914
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,660
use audio type and the numbers to

915
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:35,240
indicate the the each half see of you in

916
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:35,990
as a list and a few parameters including

917
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,939
TPN

918
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:45,799
tributary slot tubular slot granularity

919
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:48,170
and list added into the teal able to

920
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:53,660
indicate the label start and the heart

921
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:56,150
and step restrictions then so this

922
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,848
worker is taking this table and we also

923
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,849
request for the last coin the end after

924
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:03,619
review after the previous one it is

925
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:06,520
worth noting that the model is now

926
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:10,280
available on the github so everybody is

927
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:18,339
welcome to review and provide your

928
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:18,339
comments and questions for this one I

929
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:29,500
left one to the young daughters are

930
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:33,080
pretty much overloaded with reviews etc

931
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:35,930
isn't it the tea types something quite

932
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:39,348
simple that we can skip at a young

933
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:41,149
daughter view do you feel comfortable

934
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:43,089
that would progress said that at the

935
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:48,760
drafter without a young method of you

936
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:48,759
for such a simple such a simple draft

937
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:56,740
I'm trying to understand whether I am

938
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,740
the right person to answer

939
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:06,290
jo-ann's are you thinking about if there

940
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,690
is another direction of that question

941
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:11,960
does the gang doctors actually need to

942
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:15,620
see leads today to review the other

943
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:21,500
documents it's just it's a question I

944
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:24,140
don't know if you haven't won one hand

945
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,930
sir I I would like to have is it would

946
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,910
be much more efficient if we have the

947
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:31,370
same young doctor reveals the topology

948
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:33,350
and the tie for sure sure I don't know

949
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:35,060
if it's possible to ask before a cluster

950
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:37,190
review something like I put this

951
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:40,790
together with the data for whether they

952
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:44,480
get apology probably I'll try to dig a

953
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:47,900
little bit into into data tracker to see

954
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,540
if it's possible to do so yes this

955
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:53,900
linear one touched used by topology

956
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:57,200
tangling needs to be if you do topology

957
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:59,630
time and I don't know if we can why I

958
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,759
get I heard it you're not going to do as

959
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:05,050
to be done anyway before we both were at

960
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:12,080
sea nashwa that's the question for you I

961
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:16,070
don't know the answer always focus on

962
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:18,380
demo now knock on folks and I know the

963
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:22,280
young doctor will like to reveal such as

964
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:25,670
tattle but we'll have our models such as

965
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,410
interface types and another's types are

966
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:43,640
seeing the under the rug to do this

967
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:48,170
works for future way so we went through

968
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:51,950
this process with a louder sorry we went

969
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:55,610
through this process many times already

970
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:57,980
and I think I recommend if it's possible

971
00:56:55,610 --> 00:57:02,530
and then to do it them to do it as early

972
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:05,930
as you can okay there is a lot of good

973
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:09,130
feedback comes from the doctors okay

974
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:12,609
with respect to readability and

975
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:15,940
so with respect to the gravity and

976
00:57:12,609 --> 00:57:18,130
correctness of the definitions this

977
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:21,099
important thing because if you don't get

978
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:25,329
it right then many models that depend on

979
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:28,630
that also affected right so also they

980
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:31,839
sometimes require different references

981
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:43,869
so that clearly understood

982
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:47,308
so I out say yeah you go lower and about

983
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:49,900
doing a cluster review it is possible

984
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:54,700
there were not immediately in the two

985
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:58,630
you have to talk to done that one of the

986
00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:01,750
people running the process and then you

987
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:04,660
actually request the reviews immediately

988
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:15,700
off each other and cross reference in

989
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:18,730
the thanked so okay so in the next one

990
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:21,460
is next draft it's a young model for ot

991
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:23,529
intono which is also related to with the

992
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:27,970
previous two and the mainly impulse is a

993
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:31,869
layer one types so we have also did some

994
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:34,269
changer to the text and the model so

995
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:37,480
taxi is basically form a checking and

996
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:42,220
make every section complete and the

997
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:44,589
compliance with RFC eighty 407 and the

998
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:48,689
young model Chandra we also harmonized

999
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:52,359
with the T generic model the same is too

1000
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:54,700
similar as Audient apology we add the OT

1001
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:58,058
label step and the change is the path to

1002
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:00,730
be consistent with latest Titano model

1003
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:03,759
and with switch we importing from there

1004
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:05,589
one types instead of Audion types and

1005
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:09,730
the final one we would like to mention

1006
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:12,369
is we have removed as the RPC for past

1007
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:20,109
computation after we negotiate who we

1008
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:22,670
see also on the path computation in the

1009
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:24,440
t's working group to have average in air

1010
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:28,190
Rikka framework or for how to do is a

1011
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:32,120
pretty past pre-computation and it would

1012
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:35,030
be by default to follow that one and for

1013
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:41,990
the OTN specific part we will leave it

1014
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:46,400
out of this document and similarly we

1015
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:50,240
augment ins a tea tunnel model in a few

1016
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:53,390
different segments the first plan is

1017
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,819
attributes we augment itano's the tea

1018
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:59,629
bandwidth we also indicate audio types

1019
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:02,810
for for teen to represent to the

1020
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:06,470
bandwidth information and again TPN

1021
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:09,110
tstst t s last range types as that kind

1022
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:13,339
of seeing Santa representing the Audion

1023
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:15,860
labels so basically this is a consistent

1024
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:22,070
ways what we have been doing in the

1025
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:24,590
Audion topology so the next step this

1026
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:26,900
work is also technically technically

1027
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:29,330
stable we cannot see any potential

1028
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:34,670
change unless there is a change around

1029
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:36,920
the generic model so we we are

1030
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:39,290
requesting for last coin doctor review

1031
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,350
as you go suggest to start as early as

1032
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:47,600
possible as we also need to wait for the

1033
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:50,210
generic models to be published and we

1034
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:55,430
have the same github for this one for

1035
01:00:50,210 --> 01:01:00,470
all those three young files and that's

1036
01:00:55,430 --> 01:01:04,220
all okay I confirm what I said before we

1037
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:07,160
will go for the tights apology and then

1038
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:08,990
then this one okay and if possible try

1039
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:14,080
to cluster them together for the Y and

1040
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:14,080
utterly sure it'll your next right

1041
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,050
thank you

1042
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:30,009
emitter woozy from away and presenting

1043
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:43,420
on behalf of kotas the draft on eternity

1044
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:45,130
and client apology so what is the

1045
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,800
problem statement what is the problem we

1046
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,780
are trying to address with this rafter

1047
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,089
is tooth problems the first problem is

1048
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:54,910
to describe by the ethernet assess link

1049
01:01:52,089 --> 01:01:58,328
so what do we have defined up to now is

1050
01:01:54,910 --> 01:02:00,759
we have a key topology and t tunnel

1051
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:04,180
models which are low to set up a tunnel

1052
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:07,119
in the network for any type of server T

1053
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:09,250
top network like o TN and after we

1054
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:11,050
create this o TN tunnel for example we

1055
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:13,540
can map thanks to the Ethernet line

1056
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:15,250
senior we can describe how the ethernet

1057
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,009
traffic from the access link can be

1058
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:21,640
mapped and transported over the T tunnel

1059
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:23,980
what is missing is what addresses links

1060
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,890
how to represent is assess leaks in

1061
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:29,470
terms of apology how to describe the

1062
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:32,170
interlayer relationship between the

1063
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:34,240
businesses link and a seven-layer TTP

1064
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,670
because if I want to create a tunnel to

1065
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,410
carry traffic from Atlantis from a given

1066
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,900
access link there should be a back

1067
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:43,629
another tissue cavity between this SS

1068
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:45,400
link and the TTP otherwise e the traffic

1069
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:48,190
from the client cannot assess the tunnel

1070
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,780
and what are the capabilities from the

1071
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,700
access link in terms of villain

1072
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,950
classification and operations which have

1073
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:57,250
to be configured during the in decline

1074
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:58,930
signal model and one requirement we have

1075
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,790
for example in the F which people wants

1076
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:03,029
to configure per you and I Bennett

1077
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:05,710
profiles so how you can configure and a

1078
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:09,040
vendor profile on an ass's link and the

1079
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:10,900
solution is to have a client apology for

1080
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,759
Ethernet the where we report the access

1081
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,160
links and the inter layer relationship

1082
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,599
we can use the internet lock all the

1083
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:20,368
transitional link approach which is a

1084
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:23,170
general approach and will be adopted for

1085
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:26,140
indicating in ternary relationship

1086
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:28,710
between a tenet client and server key

1087
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,710
topology

1088
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:50,580
the second bonus statement can you we

1089
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:53,850
are trying to address okay next one okay

1090
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:56,910
or is basically support topology

1091
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:59,490
discovery for an eternity layer so you

1092
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,259
want to discover all the network the

1093
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:03,990
links and the notes er which are camera

1094
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:06,750
bottles which Ethernet and SLS visa and

1095
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:08,729
you can use this for par computation and

1096
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,980
tongue as the top of those LSP so

1097
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:13,200
basically is providing is yet another

1098
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,270
technology specific commentation of the

1099
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,520
generic T topology model when the

1100
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:20,240
switching technology is a layer 2 as

1101
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:23,070
switching capability and this type of

1102
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,779
switching technology is a generic T can

1103
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:27,450
be also used to support the ethernet

1104
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,920
client seniors as before and that's the

1105
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,439
eighth another technology that we can

1106
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,590
use we can represent the same topology

1107
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,640
both the server T and a client topology

1108
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:37,640
next please

1109
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:42,910
[Laughter]

1110
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,009
that we did is basically to create this

1111
01:04:53,039 --> 01:05:00,329
new one topology a model which provides

1112
01:04:56,009 --> 01:05:02,720
both T and client descriptions we as an

1113
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:07,890
augmentation of the generic T topology

1114
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:08,730
next and that's okay we can go script

1115
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,230
quickly here

1116
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,210
it's the generate the augmentation so

1117
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,549
what is the next steps okay this

1118
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:17,279
approach is quite consistent with the

1119
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:19,109
existing at EF modus 80 is just an

1120
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:20,880
augmentation of the topology where the

1121
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:22,589
client is basically providing the

1122
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,200
capabilities that are used by the client

1123
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:28,049
signal which has been recently adopted

1124
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,029
as a working document we are relying for

1125
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:32,038
problem statement under 1 on this

1126
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:34,859
document also in the transport MPI

1127
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:36,989
design team to represent the SS links to

1128
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:39,569
carry services over at the end so we

1129
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:41,789
think we can start we can move this

1130
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:44,759
worker to the working group and asked

1131
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:46,739
for a pole and his work is also

1132
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:50,309
available and we use the same a young

1133
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:52,710
model as before with Toro Tien and other

1134
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:55,410
seniors and one that that we got

1135
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:57,390
recently is whether we need packet t

1136
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:59,759
types and packet e topology as an impact

1137
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,739
on the concept on the structure of the

1138
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:03,380
document I think this can be addressed

1139
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:05,609
by the working group and we need to

1140
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,960
unseat discussing with the authors of

1141
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:08,700
those drafts because not very clever

1142
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,519
that they are generic or at least T

1143
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:20,129
specific these two documents thank you

1144
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:24,359
questions white people course the

1145
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:28,319
Michael make a quick one y te topology

1146
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:30,930
and not to polish yeah good question

1147
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:32,849
yes the reason for TS that there are

1148
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:34,828
some attributes in the T topology which

1149
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:37,440
can be useful for us for example the

1150
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:39,239
interlayer lock which allows you to link

1151
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,539
the client apology with a server

1152
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:46,170
topology you have also information about

1153
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:48,569
the client ID server ID which is a spoke

1154
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:50,369
whose exposing this topology and also

1155
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:51,989
you have the Plaga D that you can use if

1156
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:53,430
you want to stitch at us as links

1157
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:55,619
topology between two different domains

1158
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,788
these are I think them three major

1159
01:06:55,619 --> 01:07:01,109
reasons and make sense

1160
01:06:56,789 --> 01:07:03,569
thank you alright so back to your

1161
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:03,980
diagram where you had the access links

1162
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:07,920
and

1163
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:09,720
yep it's not clear which one you're

1164
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,820
trying to source or the ethernet links

1165
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:17,609
are in the under Irizarry Chris runs

1166
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:26,940
Ethernet is a service layer yes yes yes

1167
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:33,710
or OTN or yeah or WM this one is the

1168
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:37,320
topology of the server okay that I kept

1169
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:39,960
and when you're modeling l2 how's it

1170
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:45,440
different from any l2 topology basically

1171
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:52,920
is l2 VPN kind of service topology

1172
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:56,430
well cubed appear so so an l2 I mean

1173
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,720
maybe I'll expect too much but there is

1174
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,319
you know you don't sir how do you

1175
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:03,180
establish a path normal SCPD

1176
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:06,600
establishing your path it's not te

1177
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:09,330
constraining path and l2 oh this is for

1178
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,190
when you want to do a tunnel at the

1179
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:13,319
problem we are trying to address is the

1180
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:16,080
trying senior over traffic engineering

1181
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,870
Tanis so you set up a tea tunnel and you

1182
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,090
want to say which traffic goes that you

1183
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:29,819
want this particular stuff you got to go

1184
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:31,500
over this tea tunnels just know is just

1185
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,540
describing what these are the SS link

1186
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,580
because I want to say the traffic that

1187
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,380
enters the network from this s is linked

1188
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,850
with villain number 10 I want this

1189
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,430
traffic to be carried over priest

1190
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:48,330
eternal up to this last link with

1191
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:51,600
villain number 20 and then we have a

1192
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:53,580
service yes so there it cannot be any

1193
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,640
switching in between you're saying no

1194
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:59,399
I'm saying that could be maybe they

1195
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:03,540
should be divided to a service model and

1196
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:06,839
a transport model mm-hmm right where the

1197
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:09,960
service is the access things and then

1198
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:12,090
you have your time number yes this is a

1199
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,880
satanic right senior that is basically

1200
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:16,270
spelling that a draft that is clarifying

1201
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,850
how the traffic is

1202
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:20,980
Yeah right and which is a tunnel if you

1203
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:24,880
are using the problem is when you say

1204
01:09:20,979 --> 01:09:27,790
which link what is the link yes

1205
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,770
basically yeah yeah yeah yeah

1206
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:34,269
so we know to service model and then

1207
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:37,330
they have the tunnel model and the

1208
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:40,450
tunnel can separate right what are you

1209
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:42,880
mixing no no this is not so it's this

1210
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:45,880
ever you have the tunnel model the teeth

1211
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,470
on the model we can be OTN what is by

1212
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,630
the Italian motor stops the tunnel from

1213
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:51,640
this point to this point now what you

1214
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:54,640
have to say is you have to say which

1215
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,920
traffic goes here and that's the climb

1216
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,720
senior the current senior say buy the

1217
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:03,280
currency a reference to a nod to a link

1218
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:05,320
what is this link yes what is the link

1219
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,440
and what are the capabilities of the

1220
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:10,420
link and then and then make sure that

1221
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,700
the traffic that goes from this thing

1222
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:15,310
can go can assess the HTTP because

1223
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:17,679
otherwise I set up a tunnel which is not

1224
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:22,680
reachable from from the assess linker

1225
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,680
and I cannot use the tunnel thank you

1226
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:30,580
qualification so basically talking about

1227
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:32,710
where to source per se were talking

1228
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:34,930
about the investment of their to service

1229
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:37,090
right so for example if you have there

1230
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:41,320
are two VPN vision which has some kind

1231
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:44,080
of T constraints or optimization then

1232
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,719
you will do that yeah okay so it's not

1233
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:49,030
about rich purity per se its it's about

1234
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,190
traffic engineering aspect especially in

1235
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:54,630
this verse in the second thing you can

1236
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:58,240
think about this is basically a one hop

1237
01:10:54,630 --> 01:11:01,120
infinitely which is basically supported

1238
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:04,000
by and to end the tunnel in the solar

1239
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:09,250
well yeah right so so but there is also

1240
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:11,710
in important use case when it is not

1241
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:14,680
just one and two and tunnel but say a

1242
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:17,020
couple of tunnels with some moat in

1243
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:19,720
between which do a room not necessarily

1244
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:21,990
Ethernet switch and Patrick Roman your

1245
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:25,680
me speaker talking about something like

1246
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,679
service teaching

1247
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:33,610
oh no no okay there are two cases that's

1248
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,380
why we have the second problem statement

1249
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:37,630
if you would if you cannot do an

1250
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:40,270
end-to-end OTN tunnel then you ever know

1251
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:42,040
then you have a basically in principle

1252
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:44,230
to type of options one option is that

1253
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,930
the end-to-end tunnel is an eternity

1254
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:48,639
tunnel and then you have then that's why

1255
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:50,770
you have a second issue and there you

1256
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,410
have to manage an eternity topology and

1257
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:55,780
an eternity LSP so what you do you you

1258
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:58,120
created a to attend attack or detergent

1259
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:00,550
analyst becomes three links in the

1260
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,769
Eternity topology and then you set up an

1261
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:04,600
iterative tunnel but you still have to

1262
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:08,290
steer the traffic from the access link

1263
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:11,080
into this eternity tangle so so that and

1264
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:13,239
that's I said this document addresses

1265
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:15,610
both you you can expose an eternity

1266
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:17,530
topology which can be based on top of a

1267
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:20,080
new TN topology as well as a multi-layer

1268
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:22,239
topology or as you can deploy it as

1269
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,370
adjust Ethernet switches which support

1270
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:26,799
eternity LSP the topology is complete

1271
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:28,269
independent and then you are in the

1272
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,030
right even if you don't have it at this

1273
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:32,380
type of topology if all your TN you

1274
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:34,710
still have the problem to discovery

1275
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:44,530
access links so the two problems are

1276
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:47,980
orthogonal and yes okay you are saying I

1277
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:50,650
understand is that you in most of the

1278
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:54,250
cases you have a single say and wind

1279
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:56,620
tunnel which basically supports one

1280
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,590
leave a one-foot over which you will

1281
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:01,570
deliver service in more general case it

1282
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:03,760
doesn't have to be a single tunnel but

1283
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:07,179
it could be say two or three with nodes

1284
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,750
in between which is basically can

1285
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:13,210
terminate they say Donald regroup the

1286
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,830
service and put it back so in this

1287
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:17,500
respect they are not so much different

1288
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:20,350
from Ethernet switches except they have

1289
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:22,810
like that rigid you know switching

1290
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:25,960
capability from who from left to right

1291
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:27,700
and so on so yeah and in the more

1292
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:32,500
general case you have like that free

1293
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:34,389
solution which is like a more more

1294
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:40,560
comprehensive Ethernet the poles apart

1295
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:40,560
you are not talking about thank you

1296
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:48,210
thank Sita thank you not the blue

1297
01:13:53,160 --> 01:14:00,550
okay okay

1298
01:13:55,150 --> 01:14:02,349
hello everyone this is Chile I'm going

1299
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:06,190
to provide into this practices about how

1300
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:11,260
to apply the CMP s to the Beyonder

1301
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:13,719
Oaxaca coaching next since last since

1302
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:17,320
they're our top team of this job that we

1303
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:19,150
make some updates as soon as there's

1304
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:22,150
updates that's a based on the comments

1305
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:25,179
just before the opposition first up this

1306
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:28,330
is some discussion about how to report

1307
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:31,030
into the OT you see a link with healing

1308
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:34,320
where other one fingers will try to

1309
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:37,450
discover this and a second one is some

1310
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:41,170
it's based on the comments that from as

1311
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:43,809
in maybe blossom Bangkok meeting where

1312
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:46,260
are some tags about how to know should

1313
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:49,780
you tell the odious any link with

1314
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:52,270
awesome weather this is obviously

1315
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:56,740
falling how to use it food into it

1316
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:59,560
societies and also just the office after

1317
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:01,809
way some minutes later this comes this

1318
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:05,980
graph that we also received some other

1319
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:11,500
comments the first common testing has

1320
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:15,309
just about the case without a 3i that is

1321
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:17,140
things with surah at least to describe a

1322
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:20,740
trip or anything about audio singing

1323
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:23,350
with healing also ways they save some

1324
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:26,380
comments about the attacks referring

1325
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:30,160
written try to align with some other

1326
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:32,650
document not to overlap with the

1327
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:35,070
currently like OD okay arrived in

1328
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:36,610
document analysis kind of comments okay

1329
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:38,769
okay

1330
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:42,599
yeah it's proteins and I think it's

1331
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,600
pretty simple and comments

1332
01:15:48,360 --> 01:16:25,299
quick thanks Laura take your time

1333
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:27,098
Ricky all the animations they are okay

1334
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:33,309
thank you

1335
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:36,429
so time to put the clock back like free

1336
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:39,789
month and we are now in the cecum

1337
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:43,949
session in Prague I actually requested a

1338
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:46,268
slot in Prague but never happen and

1339
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:53,489
daniela claims that that's because he

1340
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:56,409
doesn't read mail maybe we mean bespoke

1341
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:59,169
cross each other so I didn't get the

1342
01:16:56,409 --> 01:17:06,759
slot this is actually what I would have

1343
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:10,449
presented in Prague yeah so what happens

1344
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:14,079
is lost like the meeting before Prague

1345
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:17,799
Prague was that we posted a new version

1346
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:21,099
of the document we restructure quite a

1347
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:30,210
bit based on comments including comments

1348
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:34,239
from a--from Daniele we put the swab in

1349
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:38,440
the interface and some interfaces back

1350
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:46,150
in moved all the requirements to the

1351
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:48,400
agenda and a lot of spelling errors and

1352
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:51,039
other grammatical changes and things

1353
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:54,308
like that because of comments we got and

1354
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:58,499
we say that the document is now or was

1355
01:17:54,309 --> 01:17:58,499
free month ago reasonably stable

1356
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,880
they have made improvements to a

1357
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:09,070
document but not really not really and

1358
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:12,520
the technical changes this is a picture

1359
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:17,110
that is and has ASCII art in the

1360
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:20,410
document and this is the I think the

1361
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:24,759
weak point of the document I tried to

1362
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:27,340
come up with a reference model I need

1363
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:33,370
help to go with this model and see if

1364
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:36,880
it's actually correct I think I had so I

1365
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:38,470
have had cross comments on it so people

1366
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,690
saying this is correct it should do it

1367
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:42,910
like that no no this is strong you

1368
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:45,969
should do it like this and then so this

1369
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:49,210
is the kind of a compromise but anyone

1370
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:51,040
they can grab me in the corridor send me

1371
01:18:49,210 --> 01:19:00,210
a mail and actually discuss this

1372
01:18:51,040 --> 01:19:06,820
reference model of these two sir so we

1373
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:10,780
put the terminology of using him we

1374
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:13,929
actually given back to our CV 4201 where

1375
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:16,540
link bundles are actually defined as

1376
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:18,760
logical interfaces on or out there we

1377
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:21,820
actually do the same saying where the

1378
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:27,370
Flexi group reflects see links on these

1379
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:30,170
boxes here it in in and out I think this

1380
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:33,289
is the second time I put them back in

1381
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:33,289
[Music]

1382
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:47,589
well yeah so we've been off to put stuff

1383
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:50,860
into document what we want to do when

1384
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:54,010
here's a list of what we think a GMP

1385
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:58,719
less control claim of LexA can do we can

1386
01:19:54,010 --> 01:20:00,910
set up flex ago or as an Ethernet

1387
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:05,739
interface you can set up a flexi client

1388
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:09,070
I say Ethan a sub interface we can

1389
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:10,849
advertise those interfaces into the

1390
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:14,509
routing system

1391
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:22,870
and we can actually set up an LSP on top

1392
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:26,270
of those that the deflection network and

1393
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:30,230
if we go to real life deployment they

1394
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:35,420
can use all of this part of this any

1395
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:38,900
subset and we can actually control the

1396
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:41,660
network not only through a control plane

1397
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:44,839
we can also use an NMS or a centralized

1398
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:47,030
controller or it can be modeled even if

1399
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,180
you want to anything is possible and

1400
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:56,530
actually I think any combination of them

1401
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:56,530
I sort of think it's also possible that

1402
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:07,670
that line break was not in my slide

1403
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:10,099
Stone has been introduced so when we do

1404
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:12,100
flexi configuration we can do we have a

1405
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:15,680
lot of alternatives are certainly

1406
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:18,620
previous slides we can use an animus

1407
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:23,120
only set up everything down to the last

1408
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:26,080
bit on the MPLS LSP became the

1409
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:32,120
combination or the Animus and conflict

1410
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:34,480
gm+ control plane or any type of the

1411
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:38,150
method we discussed before

1412
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:40,610
there isn't available signaling channel

1413
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:45,670
in flexi that we have as soon as we have

1414
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:45,670
a flexi group it's possible to use that

1415
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:54,770
so once we have configured the flexi

1416
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:59,000
level of the network we need to export

1417
01:21:54,770 --> 01:22:02,090
that to the routing system to be able to

1418
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:07,790
use it for efficient routing of any

1419
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:11,000
service on top of the flexi oh no no

1420
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:13,480
there is no animations this is almost

1421
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,480
impossible

1422
01:22:18,369 --> 01:22:25,598
ah yeah okay so let's start with an

1423
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:29,290
example where we have an MS or a

1424
01:22:25,599 --> 01:22:33,750
controller so the controller talked to

1425
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:38,280
the shin on Bo's and flexy group is

1426
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:41,500
established across and then we leave the

1427
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:45,759
Flexi client out just for in this

1428
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:49,230
example but this information could be

1429
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:52,770
exported to the control plane and then

1430
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:59,138
to any routing system that we have and

1431
01:22:52,770 --> 01:23:05,920
then ah yeah so then we have a network

1432
01:22:59,139 --> 01:23:12,849
where we have a mix of flexi capable

1433
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:20,040
links where blue and all non flexi

1434
01:23:12,849 --> 01:23:20,040
capable they are yellow and you want to

1435
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:28,119
it's kind of playing a trick on me so

1436
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:33,759
you want to set up a connectivity from

1437
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:36,880
here to there and the straight link you

1438
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:42,670
would where you could go if you only use

1439
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:47,099
term cost metrics would be going across

1440
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:50,010
from here so now we introduce the

1441
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:55,179
condition that we actually want to use

1442
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:58,869
flexi cable links all the way from A to

1443
01:23:55,179 --> 01:24:01,420
B and then we actually get something

1444
01:23:58,869 --> 01:24:04,389
that traverses the network that way I

1445
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:07,100
don't know it it's the best you can find

1446
01:24:04,389 --> 01:24:09,060
a better way but I don't think so

1447
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,349
[Music]

1448
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:14,949
question for clarification before you

1449
01:24:11,349 --> 01:24:18,219
move on so these are this is a

1450
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:21,280
collection of a flexi links or is a

1451
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:26,500
fluctuating from the ingress to the

1452
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:29,719
egress so one thing that we actually

1453
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:32,810
said like 200 times in

1454
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:36,950
males to the mailing list and in the

1455
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:43,030
presentation here a flexi linked yes

1456
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:44,929
switched yes between two boxes it termed

1457
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:48,679
originates and one box

1458
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:52,730
terminus on the other but in the control

1459
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:55,790
claim you can see which boxes that has

1460
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:59,169
flexi links attached and to which spoke

1461
01:24:55,790 --> 01:25:01,970
in the box it go so you can pick

1462
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:06,230
interfaces someone called a daisy

1463
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:08,540
chaining I think I was deeper but yeah

1464
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:12,559
that's what we do but that's what you do

1465
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:15,800
always on these nuts you you probably do

1466
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:17,720
you do exactly the same thing you say

1467
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:20,240
you want to have an Ethernet link with

1468
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:22,400
the following characteristics and then

1469
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:26,090
you do daisy chaining across to get

1470
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:34,040
there with to the other side did that

1471
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:37,130
yeah okay so next steps well since we

1472
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:40,160
didn't present at last time we kind of

1473
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:45,860
did go in hibernate for three months and

1474
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:50,210
now we're back here I'm prepared to work

1475
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:53,269
further than this but yes now it's kind

1476
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:56,030
of hard because I need the input from

1477
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:58,040
very working room and the only time only

1478
01:25:56,030 --> 01:26:00,349
way to get that is actually making a

1479
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:02,180
working group document and we have other

1480
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:04,220
reflection document that actually

1481
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:09,070
depends on this so we should really make

1482
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:09,070
it a working group document quite soon I

1483
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:18,469
think I'm done let's go to questions

1484
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:21,740
before falling please please my question

1485
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:25,450
is the first question since it's kind of

1486
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,450
like an MVP fine

1487
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:37,910
can you repeat that I'm philosophy

1488
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:44,820
planet it'd be fine as a network layer

1489
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:50,330
can flexi client be defined as a network

1490
01:26:44,820 --> 01:27:06,030
layer and I don't really think so

1491
01:26:50,330 --> 01:27:10,800
but the collection try to use a CB key

1492
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:14,370
to set up a free clinic kinnexa sure

1493
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:27,500
yeah same way as you set up on the other

1494
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:31,340
link the thing I think we can model as a

1495
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:35,610
network layer is the collection of

1496
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:42,480
existing flexi clients in the network

1497
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:45,500
not a single link if I remember correct

1498
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:49,889
in current philosophy if a plan

1499
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:53,040
stranded there's no information look

1500
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:55,290
like sauce or twice information out at

1501
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:57,450
Stinson address information to a Final

1502
01:27:55,290 --> 01:28:02,760
Four philosophy planet without whose

1503
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:09,000
lives you how great a lot of likely

1504
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:12,830
planet connects I don't clearly get the

1505
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:17,820
question that anyone can help me

1506
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:23,280
although could you repeat your question

1507
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:33,059
you say it in Chinese have you want to

1508
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:36,120
tell satire in Chinese in currently

1509
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:39,750
country in the freshly-baked technology

1510
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:41,460
as soon as there's no instance of

1511
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:44,800
information like a lot

1512
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:47,770
salsa - I saw destination twice be fine

1513
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,920
for crazy connected with our lives

1514
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:55,630
how can you say flatly canonical

1515
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:56,230
connection its Augusta anyway took a

1516
01:28:55,630 --> 01:29:00,460
look at it

1517
01:28:56,230 --> 01:29:09,519
so how do you do it with your model

1518
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:22,210
driven in a young model so we have the

1519
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:24,910
identifiers here also that's so you sing

1520
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:28,000
you can do something with the same going

1521
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:30,280
to the same arrived 5 you can do it in

1522
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:39,580
Jiang but you can't do it with a control

1523
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:42,130
plane but it seems to be the connection

1524
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:44,490
with nice big here let's repeat so it's

1525
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:44,490
in high

1526
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:58,840
so that song you start working on the

1527
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,640
signaling part and the routing Park we

1528
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:05,140
need to define those things correctly

1529
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:14,050
it's has been done before so why

1530
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:15,610
couldn't we do it here so we take now

1531
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:21,340
julienne and then we have a remote

1532
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:23,230
question go to the next slide with the

1533
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:27,850
network please

1534
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:31,650
here I'm confused with the use case you

1535
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:35,680
depict here why would i has an operator

1536
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:38,200
set up an RSP of our xtq Alex or not you

1537
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:41,100
know what I will need is I have 200 big

1538
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:43,420
service to set up my recipes to hoagies

1539
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:46,900
where I care is the bandwidth of the

1540
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:49,180
link whether there are flexi capable or

1541
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:50,969
not I need to her lips over a blue or

1542
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:54,880
yellow things I don't care if they're

1543
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:56,530
achieve 200 with flexi or not it's

1544
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,630
matter of setting up to the capita

1545
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:02,019
capacity between the neighbors using

1546
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:04,510
plexi or not but I don't see the use

1547
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:09,160
case of setting up our needs to be over

1548
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:12,580
a flexi capable set of links I don't see

1549
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:17,139
the value sorry okay so I think that

1550
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:20,830
question is one of the custom we really

1551
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:25,660
had to address the thing here is that my

1552
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:30,990
assumption is that flex e links have a

1553
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:34,210
bandwidth that the way way bigger then

1554
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:37,000
had the bonnets on maybe sometimes it

1555
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:39,850
will flex accrete C capable thing that

1556
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:43,270
could it be by my pass computation

1557
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:51,550
sometime what but whether I reach my

1558
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:53,980
money using other weight you kind of

1559
01:31:51,550 --> 01:32:00,390
interrupted me so say if the way way

1560
01:31:53,980 --> 01:32:04,030
bigger bandwidth and it's possible to

1561
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:06,670
split them up in granularity so you can

1562
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:10,120
actually allocate bandwidth on a flexi

1563
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:12,670
client for a specific purpose and you

1564
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:15,849
can't do that on Ethernet on a regular

1565
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:20,440
Ethernet so in regularly that you mix

1566
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:24,850
packets over the same same link in Flex

1567
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:27,429
and in flexi you can send traffic on a

1568
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:38,860
dedicated bandwidth that it's just for

1569
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:41,950
you between my Flex equal ends which on

1570
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:44,440
a particular flex flex II group you have

1571
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:46,750
a flexi client that has a certain

1572
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:51,790
boundary we can give you all that

1573
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:54,960
bandwidth to you only and there's no way

1574
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:58,780
of doing that on on the regular Ethernet

1575
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:02,890
and that's a point where the flexi I

1576
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:04,670
think it's just to me that unify in

1577
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:07,850
flexi as

1578
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:13,610
a kind of what were you used to go back

1579
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:15,830
gels is not the label switching or kind

1580
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,299
of connection or EOD Ethernet which is

1581
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:19,820
not the way I'm understanding flexi

1582
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:22,210
today so that's why probably I'm

1583
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:22,210
confused

1584
01:33:24,679 --> 01:33:29,060
Dave synagro from erickson I'm kind of

1585
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:30,949
with Julian on this I mean how is this

1586
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:34,100
any different than what we have with

1587
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:48,559
gels and Ethernet today the the Flexi is

1588
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:50,600
not no we don't have gel sorry so my

1589
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,639
understanding of the flexi links is the

1590
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:56,929
flexi is not visible to anything above

1591
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:59,270
the ethernet 60 to 64 66 b right so how

1592
01:33:56,929 --> 01:34:01,310
does any kind of control protocol know

1593
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:04,610
that it's even talking about a flexi

1594
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:07,699
link remain convinced of them o says

1595
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:10,630
we're not going to use the Oh out there

1596
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:13,610
you're gonna make it visible well

1597
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:15,290
totally flexi because the whole thing

1598
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:16,909
behind flexi was that it was hidden

1599
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:20,119
underneath Ethernet it looked like

1600
01:34:16,909 --> 01:34:25,159
Ethernet to the upper layers so you're

1601
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:30,230
saying this isn't quite flexing its

1602
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:33,349
flexi define you define a flexi client

1603
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:38,178
over your over your flexi group that

1604
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:44,900
flexi client is visible for the control

1605
01:34:38,179 --> 01:34:48,619
plane they uses a flexi on later no

1606
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:51,259
flexi client flexi is configured

1607
01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:53,780
underneath even and it's done on a very

1608
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:56,119
coarse granular basis by configuration

1609
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:58,280
so the idea that it's dynamic and we can

1610
01:34:56,119 --> 01:35:00,860
switch the bandwidth you know with a

1611
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,690
control protocol to Tilly's point which

1612
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:04,790
i think i understood there's not a

1613
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:07,519
handle for the control protocol to get

1614
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:10,850
ahold of unless you're exposing it

1615
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:14,630
algorithmic ste for 66 beat layer in

1616
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:19,030
which case it's not Alya flexi and it

1617
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:19,030
probably violates 8o 2.3

1618
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:33,290
so what did handle do you use if you use

1619
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:36,710
it from the yang model change the

1620
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:38,630
configuration that box in that box the

1621
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:40,489
same way I would forget the yang model I

1622
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:43,160
use the proprietary data model that

1623
01:35:40,489 --> 01:35:49,849
works the same way but there's no

1624
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:52,519
control for us all to do anything to

1625
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:55,660
help you know I think you're talking

1626
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:59,690
with guys from different levels okay so

1627
01:35:55,660 --> 01:36:02,450
it is true that on the on the flying

1628
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:04,549
player it just Ethernet right but but

1629
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:06,679
for example how to actually implement

1630
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:09,830
this Ethernet it's a different story and

1631
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:11,960
require different orchestration or

1632
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:14,269
control mechanism it just like for

1633
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:16,730
example when you are castrates a layer 3

1634
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:18,560
VPN service from the client point of

1635
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:21,200
view just leave MVP enough from the

1636
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,450
orchestrator point of view it's many

1637
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:27,110
many different other things he put in

1638
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:30,889
setting up tunnels steering services and

1639
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:32,330
so forth right so so if I understood you

1640
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:34,310
correctly we are talking about the

1641
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:40,360
letter basically orchestration the

1642
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:44,630
support for flexing is - then incorrect

1643
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:48,320
yeah think so yeah then it's basically

1644
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:51,500
it answers both children and do it

1645
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:53,210
because they're thinking about like from

1646
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:56,660
the client point of view is just purely

1647
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:59,480
son yet ok just not from the client is a

1648
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,790
pure way our three BPM but actual

1649
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:03,500
implementation that makes very big

1650
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:06,860
difference whether for example the f3

1651
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:09,530
BPM is T rather I can say it or not and

1652
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:11,299
other things right so it requires

1653
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:18,590
different models and different control

1654
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:20,780
mechanism just a second we are seeing

1655
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:22,880
some time to the next presentations but

1656
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:24,920
I think this is a pretty acquirement to

1657
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,210
the next presentation so I would keep on

1658
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:28,660
discussing it

1659
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:31,540
if the presenters of the next

1660
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:38,530
the slots have nothing to complain about

1661
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:39,580
okay let's go ahead no Laura go to the

1662
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:45,190
one we were you showing your mesh

1663
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:48,070
network okay so I think people are just

1664
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:52,799
concerned that those intermediate nodes

1665
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:54,969
you're showing switching of the flexi on

1666
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,160
and I think you're doing that but I

1667
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:59,770
guess what it would come down to it's

1668
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:04,290
how you advertise the bandwidth the

1669
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:06,490
flexi is capable of optimizing better

1670
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:09,100
for different bandwidths instead of

1671
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:14,260
nailing up a whole save hundred gig on a

1672
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:17,470
wavelength it's able to to do more

1673
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:19,900
granularity but I guess how I guess

1674
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:25,300
Julianne area Mary said that we would

1675
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:28,960
not look at necessarily having to prefer

1676
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:31,060
a flexi route in that it's flexi the

1677
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:34,330
preference would be more that you would

1678
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:37,000
have better bandwidth optimization for

1679
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:39,670
those links so when it's advertised you

1680
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:44,770
would be able to see that you could

1681
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:46,870
support this intermediate rate and so it

1682
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:49,000
would be not so much that it's

1683
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:51,160
advertised as flexi it would be

1684
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,270
advertised more that it can do this

1685
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:58,900
granularity and they only so I think you

1686
01:38:55,270 --> 01:39:01,330
know it's just as when we had SDH signal

1687
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:04,750
or TN signal you advertise different

1688
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:06,970
granularities that you could support and

1689
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:10,360
that's what people are looking for in

1690
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:11,980
their Browning tables so here that's

1691
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,049
wrong thing you miss it's not so much

1692
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:16,389
that it's flex EU when I will text you

1693
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:18,460
want to advertise the types of bandwidth

1694
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:21,780
that can be supported on that way and

1695
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:26,040
that's what you would go hunt for then

1696
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:33,219
so you're saying based on a flexi client

1697
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:37,449
you can advertise bandwidth okay so one

1698
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:39,800
is nodding the one is shaking your head

1699
01:39:37,449 --> 01:39:41,719
so the way I understand this is you

1700
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,399
wouldn't advertise it as a flexi

1701
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:46,359
climbing what advertise it is an

1702
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:49,129
Ethernet link with very good QoS

1703
01:39:46,359 --> 01:39:51,409
characteristics things that could hit a

1704
01:39:49,129 --> 01:39:52,999
very fine level of jitter of things that

1705
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:55,728
you link they could hit a very fine

1706
01:39:52,999 --> 01:39:59,079
level of latency things that could

1707
01:39:55,729 --> 01:40:01,969
handle a very strict key or less policy

1708
01:39:59,079 --> 01:40:03,768
but it's Ethernet and it gets advertised

1709
01:40:01,969 --> 01:40:06,260
and propagated through the routing and

1710
01:40:03,769 --> 01:40:10,249
the control protocols as Ethernet which

1711
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:15,590
we can already do today a new connection

1712
01:40:10,249 --> 01:40:20,239
and and you can actually on what is

1713
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:22,449
basically the Flexi group down down that

1714
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:26,659
that you don't see you can actually

1715
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:30,018
advertise more than one more than one

1716
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:37,070
chunk of bandwidth no affects your

1717
01:40:30,019 --> 01:40:40,280
client there's nothing to grab onto the

1718
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:42,469
Flexi group there is nothing exposed to

1719
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,938
grab on to and advertise I can't send it

1720
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:46,999
in routing I can't send it in a

1721
01:40:43,939 --> 01:40:49,129
signaling protocol to Igor's point yeah

1722
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:50,929
the orchestration would be different why

1723
01:40:49,129 --> 01:40:53,599
because it's in the interface

1724
01:40:50,929 --> 01:40:55,909
configuration that I configure the Flexi

1725
01:40:53,599 --> 01:40:58,129
groups and the channels and associate

1726
01:40:55,909 --> 01:41:00,379
them together not in the control

1727
01:40:58,129 --> 01:41:03,590
protocol and not on the priority so it's

1728
01:41:00,379 --> 01:41:05,449
very static it can be changed and then

1729
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:07,669
that can be reflected into the routing

1730
01:41:05,449 --> 01:41:10,789
into the control protocol but as far as

1731
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:18,919
I understand oh I F flexi it's

1732
01:41:10,789 --> 01:41:20,929
configured in its point one yeah this is

1733
01:41:18,919 --> 01:41:38,119
the most complex a session uh since M

1734
01:41:20,929 --> 01:41:42,649
KSTP okay I think we deserve law at

1735
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:44,419
least appalling so even if it's really

1736
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:47,899
really difficult to understand which

1737
01:41:44,419 --> 01:41:50,480
question to ask so how many people

1738
01:41:47,899 --> 01:41:58,520
believe that we should work on a flag

1739
01:41:50,480 --> 01:42:10,910
see in general hey now what's the next

1740
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:14,180
question is these etiquette technical

1741
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:16,489
internet yeah the next question mama

1742
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:19,670
would be how much extra work is that you

1743
01:42:16,489 --> 01:42:22,400
do over the top of the gmpls for the

1744
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:32,660
pbbt or gmpls for the ethernet that we

1745
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:41,330
already have so now let's let's make it

1746
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:45,410
simpler maybe a fee fee goes up to lower

1747
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:50,600
so when I saw at least one before I

1748
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:54,320
thought okay let's extend LMP so we set

1749
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:57,770
up the end points for Frieza net and we

1750
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:59,299
are all done but what confused me that

1751
01:42:57,770 --> 01:43:01,310
presentation and also there are

1752
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,739
discussions to create a kind of a

1753
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:09,230
network layer out of it by selecting

1754
01:43:03,739 --> 01:43:12,759
everything so again from a my

1755
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:14,870
perspective ending heading into LP

1756
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:18,560
should be kind of straightforward and

1757
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:21,650
that I would add that or whose kind of

1758
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:27,710
connectivity a little bit more reluctant

1759
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:30,019
or they should lead it up the

1760
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:31,880
significant Cove Ericsson again it the

1761
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:35,630
risk of confusing the situation even

1762
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:39,020
further there is work on a flexi switch

1763
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:41,120
technology flexi switched I mean for

1764
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:44,120
tying sister right you have flex T

1765
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:46,849
switch sub-layer that would be something

1766
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,739
that we possibly that we would possibly

1767
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:51,350
look at C camp to create a control

1768
01:43:48,739 --> 01:43:52,969
protocol before right but there's a

1769
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:54,050
whole lot of extra work there's a whole

1770
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:58,730
lot of work that needs to be done

1771
01:43:54,050 --> 01:44:00,620
instead of the 15 first oh okay and the

1772
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:02,780
name is the same way we would be if flex

1773
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:03,639
he dies on another game there is called

1774
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:08,949
G de

1775
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:12,820
chiana transport that which is reached

1776
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:14,978
while flexi is not which is a switch to

1777
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:16,898
white flexi it's us it's got it's a

1778
01:44:14,979 --> 01:44:22,119
switch cell layer think of it is a new

1779
01:44:16,899 --> 01:44:26,669
type of OTN so to speak but this is not

1780
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:26,669
what what louis document is covering

1781
01:44:39,749 --> 01:44:55,300
okay guys I'm sweating let me let fat I

1782
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:57,189
and I have some sort of it offline and

1783
01:44:55,300 --> 01:45:13,689
then we will discuss on the list that's

1784
01:44:57,189 --> 01:45:16,110
good let's go to next presentation does

1785
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:19,329
it better okay

1786
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:22,360
this is Michael from Holly and notice

1787
01:45:19,329 --> 01:45:25,780
our I helped to my colleague you are

1788
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:27,789
long to pretend is document this

1789
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:29,829
document needs to talk about young day

1790
01:45:27,789 --> 01:45:34,360
tomorrow for Falacci magnaflux the

1791
01:45:29,829 --> 01:45:37,659
interface measurement okay if we want to

1792
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:41,348
configure flux the interface so see

1793
01:45:37,659 --> 01:45:44,289
really is a sacrament fussy manner and

1794
01:45:41,349 --> 01:45:47,260
if we need to configure to flossy group

1795
01:45:44,289 --> 01:45:50,110
as a network interface the bonding

1796
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:52,329
multiple fluxes of basic skills and the

1797
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:56,228
key figure of the flossing hunt and a

1798
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:59,768
mapping juice large philosophers and we

1799
01:45:56,229 --> 01:46:02,469
also to need to provide ability to drive

1800
01:45:59,769 --> 01:46:05,800
the flux user Staters include is a

1801
01:46:02,469 --> 01:46:11,189
flashy group plus the physicals and the

1802
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:11,189
flossy grunt also we need to support

1803
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:15,630
interface management in implication of

1804
01:46:14,559 --> 01:46:18,960
both st

1805
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:26,010
and distribute routing and our way also

1806
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:28,500
to support flag c 2.0 and also want to

1807
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:33,540
support back work pat bow with a fluffy

1808
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:35,850
one point error so it will go away is

1809
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:39,000
that the frosty years some kind of

1810
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:42,350
interface so we should do some walks

1811
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:45,870
like young did model for interface as

1812
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:49,620
young HIV on data remotely interface on

1813
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:52,949
tekmoto is deterrent following following

1814
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:56,420
criteria stick the defender streaming of

1815
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:59,190
network traffic and it's important to

1816
01:46:56,420 --> 01:47:01,469
apply features and the protocol

1817
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:06,150
forwarding configurations training

1818
01:47:01,469 --> 01:47:11,820
traffic and it also defined an interface

1819
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:15,388
type which present in Darcy sent to 24

1820
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:16,849
and its status such as twenty Vista can

1821
01:47:15,389 --> 01:47:21,690
be maintained

1822
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:26,460
okay here is our design of the erotic of

1823
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:30,269
interfacing Flossie we different - Madhu

1824
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:33,989
sir - blocks is Flossie group and flask

1825
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:36,600
hunt and a measurement as an interface

1826
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:39,780
and it opposed argument for ITF

1827
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:43,409
interface emotive grant is actually

1828
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:46,500
contending for secret and they can be

1829
01:47:43,409 --> 01:47:52,679
convicted based our results and some

1830
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:58,050
fallacies out this is our young model

1831
01:47:52,679 --> 01:48:03,380
trees and okay this is what we have to

1832
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:06,210
after previous last status meeting we

1833
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:09,540
because plastic Ron is decoupled from

1834
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:13,739
philosophy guru so it is a motive as a

1835
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:16,860
new type of interface so a new France

1836
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:19,049
account can be more appropriate motive

1837
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:22,110
and easy to be recommend to support more

1838
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:25,170
some new Mac layers features such as a

1839
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:28,139
flow can show and the way you want to

1840
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:30,230
keep this module simple so we removed

1841
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:33,930
data plans in window implementation

1842
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:37,950
depend on the artifacts such as a

1843
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:40,710
fluxing to instance vendor NB and the

1844
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:47,970
way also a to new author who works full

1845
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:51,630
of paper homes okay this is some i knows

1846
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:55,170
and even even though another our houses

1847
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:57,150
drafter brother are i still review okay

1848
01:48:55,170 --> 01:49:00,890
there's a working group skaters and no

1849
01:48:57,150 --> 01:49:04,559
okay there may be some another walks

1850
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:06,810
do is a flat c interface module so here

1851
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:11,390
is a separation where is this module and

1852
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:14,900
the way that to coordinate ways another

1853
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:17,910
document ulcers and we know no sizes

1854
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:21,450
difference way present here and the

1855
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:26,160
wither back to post exists difference on

1856
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:28,200
the mailing list and maybe it's a

1857
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:32,490
working group and another folks here

1858
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:39,210
past to present as here 'dear under give

1859
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:43,260
us some comments yes the next time this

1860
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:47,820
is less right so okay yes I see I'd like

1861
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:50,310
to coordinate Raza officers and but

1862
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:55,620
since there are quite different opinions

1863
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:57,810
so maybe we internally we will decide to

1864
01:49:55,620 --> 01:50:00,210
update the documenting our way and

1865
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:03,510
there's a working group who may help us

1866
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:06,330
to make a decision how to his works are

1867
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:10,170
shall be processed and the would like to

1868
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:12,650
como people to help us to reveal this

1869
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:12,650
document

1870
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:22,339
[Music]

1871
01:50:44,420 --> 01:52:03,059
okay so so what do you want to use is

1872
01:52:00,929 --> 01:52:05,780
grande in the B you want to do some

1873
01:52:03,059 --> 01:52:09,989
configuration data transaction

1874
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:12,079
translator transaction to verify whether

1875
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:15,900
this negative data can be configured

1876
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:20,429
crack crack

1877
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:23,219
doesn't cry what was it you do because

1878
01:52:20,429 --> 01:52:30,179
I'm not an expert Eon fancy do some

1879
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:32,460
walks out a young module so so actually

1880
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:34,440
on your presentation is relevant to this

1881
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:38,579
one and the you are the last one so we

1882
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:44,699
have only eight minutes so I'm sorry to

1883
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:46,030
say that we have enough time for other

1884
01:52:44,699 --> 01:52:47,799
work to all services

1885
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:50,199
the surgeons will have more discussion

1886
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:55,659
after you know our chili specifications

1887
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:58,329
right oh okay so the question the first

1888
01:52:55,659 --> 01:53:01,269
day is because if you module supported

1889
01:52:58,329 --> 01:53:04,269
to mdhil and the architecture the young

1890
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:07,630
models and the architecture also can

1891
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:11,770
provides ability to require to help you

1892
01:53:07,630 --> 01:53:13,840
to do the configuration transaction it

1893
01:53:11,770 --> 01:53:15,789
can help you intended Edisto the

1894
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,369
intended it's though they can help you

1895
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:21,250
to verify whether this mode this data

1896
01:53:18,369 --> 01:53:24,179
can be configured whether asa can be

1897
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:34,150
whether it's in print and in the

1898
01:53:24,179 --> 01:53:35,380
operational data store but if you use

1899
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:37,900
the reconfiguration

1900
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:40,119
how about okay you haven't against all

1901
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:46,920
of this damage instance and I can't

1902
01:53:40,119 --> 01:53:49,329
thank you thank you we have a remote

1903
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:53,739
remotely your on longer which tried the

1904
01:53:49,329 --> 01:53:55,989
three times that if it's if it's shorter

1905
01:53:53,739 --> 01:53:59,428
you can make a comment that you're long

1906
01:53:55,989 --> 01:54:07,150
and if we manage it to make you speak

1907
01:53:59,429 --> 01:54:10,840
quick thank you shimon peres me yes yeah

1908
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:13,659
first for the young or young module

1909
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:17,980
itself all they have a multiple restore

1910
01:54:13,659 --> 01:54:21,848
capabilities such as startup her

1911
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:25,989
candidate learning substance so we don't

1912
01:54:21,849 --> 01:54:30,730
need to leave it in the action another

1913
01:54:25,989 --> 01:54:34,869
point is if you automatically add a new

1914
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:38,230
client usually it's done in sequence you

1915
01:54:34,869 --> 01:54:43,659
cannot add to it her on some day on the

1916
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:51,519
first day if you do it her one by one

1917
01:54:43,659 --> 01:54:55,480
for example today and this week then you

1918
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:57,469
can send the to working relations in

1919
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:59,839
sequence and

1920
01:54:57,469 --> 01:55:02,630
so that the plane can still regards the

1921
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:05,449
first the previous condition as current

1922
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:09,980
a and it's a new combination as a kind

1923
01:55:05,449 --> 01:55:13,969
of B so it doesn't matter we provided

1924
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:20,290
her in the communication module as a

1925
01:55:13,969 --> 01:55:20,290
hunter a II or Canada B that's my point

1926
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:37,030
finish so again not from Erickson but

1927
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:39,739
I'm speaking as the liaison manager BBF

1928
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:42,650
there is work in the Broadway inform

1929
01:55:39,739 --> 01:55:48,530
that is waiting on some sort of the yang

1930
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:55,989
model to be able to configure will have

1931
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:58,400
to wait I just wear that there is work

1932
01:55:55,989 --> 01:56:00,230
whether or not it ever comes to fruition

1933
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:15,170
or not as a difference I already feel I

1934
01:56:00,230 --> 01:56:19,190
would be seeking Singapore okay thank

1935
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:21,739
you little chilly again for this protein

1936
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:25,099
since it's at some it model in a way for

1937
01:56:21,739 --> 01:56:28,190
powerful flexi next okay this is a

1938
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:30,739
content of this so this is an updated of

1939
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:33,769
the draft of progressing or - at UTS a

1940
01:56:30,739 --> 01:56:35,839
top-15 and conversing with a draft and

1941
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:39,199
also for questioning the minister next

1942
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:41,390
step and for update so it just as us we

1943
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:46,190
made a point the force of III doesn't

1944
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:48,350
expire the value although I think this

1945
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:51,469
can be usually the case of a mismatch

1946
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:53,690
checking and a second one we added to

1947
01:56:51,469 --> 01:56:55,969
configuration more the for Policy Canada

1948
01:56:53,690 --> 01:57:00,949
it could be master/slave mode it could

1949
01:56:55,969 --> 01:57:04,100
be we've got this requirement from Cisco

1950
01:57:00,949 --> 01:57:06,889
from some vendors and we also found some

1951
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:11,300
related information related at escorting

1952
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:14,330
you for a CI and the soda where I

1953
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:16,820
sorry we either flesh you kinda to sorta

1954
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:19,700
location information we give someone s

1955
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:22,790
as a why when you know why we want to do

1956
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:25,280
this we also had a new answer from Cisco

1957
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:29,780
and the photo fluorescein necessarily

1958
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:30,710
sort of updated accordingly and next

1959
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:32,960
time

1960
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:35,510
this is a clinical location sort of a

1961
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:37,790
locus information we didn't worry about

1962
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:39,940
is a lot because was the first time we

1963
01:57:37,790 --> 01:57:43,160
don't want to put this information in

1964
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:45,410
2000 because we are thinking about it

1965
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:48,710
was it's differently oh it's similar

1966
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:53,090
okay after some discussing with the guys

1967
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:57,010
from actually some all also recalled

1968
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:59,420
some information from flexi I did with

1969
01:57:57,010 --> 01:58:02,120
continuous in the same at the first

1970
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:06,590
group of the fleshy planet has just some

1971
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:08,870
ethics over yeast notified so was single

1972
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:11,030
okay that's the phone network a point of

1973
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:13,280
a opposed for a second and in a cortical

1974
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:16,460
the existing you know sim that water

1975
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:18,740
layer it can be aware of the existence

1976
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:21,770
of a saucer that's why I would do this

1977
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:27,380
in the modeling and next we add some

1978
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:31,160
explain okay the model value number five

1979
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:33,050
my calendar configuration we just use

1980
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:35,540
also to do a mismatch mapping from

1981
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:37,430
different level and for the right side

1982
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:39,850
of this is an idea that we add the true

1983
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:42,260
configuration mode of a flex eternity

1984
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:44,300
it's amazing that you for accelerating

1985
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:47,600
from some description idea but in the

1986
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:49,460
country is not indeed over 1823 I got

1987
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:51,350
some feedback from question 14 we should

1988
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:54,380
talk about this over the question

1989
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:58,340
learning to sing together you from then

1990
01:58:54,380 --> 01:59:02,210
why took all the information over Sierra

1991
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:04,100
I'm standing currently either two moles

1992
01:59:02,210 --> 01:59:08,750
of the first - static mode with us very

1993
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:10,700
uses a country to to configure both the

1994
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:14,090
transceiver side and the receiver side

1995
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:15,889
and and a father ii know that we just

1996
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:18,890
say it's masculine even more we just

1997
01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:20,900
used to configure the soft side another

1998
01:59:18,890 --> 01:59:22,700
computer information can be conveying

1999
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:24,659
that were destinations through overhead

2000
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:26,730
and the current

2001
01:59:24,659 --> 01:59:28,290
this is an update on the photos we seen

2002
01:59:26,730 --> 01:59:32,459
the progress in your life and activities

2003
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:34,469
that was 15 I think that is no okay

2004
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:37,350
public progress in your country that

2005
01:59:34,469 --> 01:59:41,070
working young a 2.1 was about another

2006
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:44,460
publicity years and for 715 I think they

2007
01:59:41,070 --> 01:59:47,210
concentrated as 8.8 23 I mean didn't

2008
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:50,460
have one to income that the Frazee I

2009
01:59:47,210 --> 01:59:53,610
true wasn't true that hey the Pharisee

2010
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:56,400
instance and that way also submit a

2011
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:59,009
pricing model comes video sent to the

2012
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:01,138
management question question is really

2013
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:07,580
so we don't have creature to look at the

2014
02:00:01,139 --> 02:00:10,230
next steps okay the next question

2015
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:12,570
what do we define another kilobytes also

2016
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:15,209
some local scope okay next step

2017
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:17,639
whistling who currently the requirements

2018
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:19,350
is required a courier we have a lot of

2019
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:23,370
disgust and violation we incur the ways

2020
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:25,949
for a CIA date upon an editor with also

2021
02:00:23,370 --> 02:00:29,010
some guys from question 14 question 11

2022
02:00:25,949 --> 02:00:32,099
our single I said so there was that yeah

2023
02:00:29,010 --> 02:00:33,840
from Anacin thank you thanks things in

2024
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:37,860
the group now speaking from Erickson

2025
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:40,920
this is this model seems more consistent

2026
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:42,929
with my understanding of flexi and my

2027
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:45,870
question is have you confirmed this with

2028
02:00:42,929 --> 02:00:48,150
OIF have you run this bio I up it says

2029
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:50,340
surely he went by your slide one for

2030
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:52,650
Title II to move forward but I was

2031
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:54,480
reading that so is this confirmed to be

2032
02:00:52,650 --> 02:00:57,210
like a model that would reflect the old

2033
02:00:54,480 --> 02:01:02,120
away a flexi 2.0 interface

2034
02:00:57,210 --> 02:01:05,400
I guess Hawaii with a guy if I might

2035
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:07,170
also say that yeah well missing what's

2036
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:10,110
missing in the work that I'm familiar

2037
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:13,620
with is a model to be able to configure

2038
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:16,049
by a yang a flexi 2.0 interface yeah

2039
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:18,210
that's what's missing so I was a little

2040
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:20,100
distraught at the previous hunt the

2041
02:01:18,210 --> 02:01:23,040
previous draft that said that they were

2042
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:24,540
defining flexi is a new type of

2043
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:26,670
interface because really it's an

2044
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:30,449
Ethernet interface like you presented

2045
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:32,580
here right so this seems more in line

2046
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:36,469
with the understanding of the folks that

2047
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:36,469
I know that are progressive or okay

2048
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:43,419
how many hallelujah this comment applies

2049
02:01:41,590 --> 02:01:45,489
to both this presentation in the

2050
02:01:43,419 --> 02:01:47,079
previous one I don't know we understand

2051
02:01:45,489 --> 02:01:50,650
that there are related to war people's

2052
02:01:47,079 --> 02:01:53,289
OIF and itu-t but the more importance in

2053
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:55,780
Syria is we also need to design a young

2054
02:01:53,289 --> 02:01:57,969
model that's fits into the Hawaii of

2055
02:01:55,780 --> 02:02:03,130
young system and as we need to look into

2056
02:01:57,969 --> 02:02:04,900
other young model specifies here so as

2057
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:07,630
far as I know I didn't see any merit

2058
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:20,199
written directly augmentations to other

2059
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:22,139
models last one so pretending you're the

2060
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:24,909
last comment my understanding is that

2061
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:28,749
having a model that would be compliant

2062
02:02:24,909 --> 02:02:31,478
with and fit into the ITF yang model

2063
02:02:28,749 --> 02:02:34,599
structure and having that same model fit

2064
02:02:31,479 --> 02:02:36,099
into the data modeling information model

2065
02:02:34,599 --> 02:02:46,119
and coming out of study group fifteen

2066
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:48,130
may be mutually exclusive email from my

2067
02:02:46,119 --> 02:02:50,380
colleague and Sims there are quite

2068
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:56,559
different there are quite a lot of

2069
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:59,469
issues so maybe we are for the mother

2070
02:02:56,559 --> 02:03:02,889
Jean maybe it's a lot of issues we

2071
02:02:59,469 --> 02:03:06,159
should further discussions so I think I

2072
02:03:02,889 --> 02:03:09,510
think that we need flux the young lady

2073
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:12,369
mother insist I have but I don't think

2074
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:19,449
we can do this walk face of this

2075
02:03:12,369 --> 02:03:21,659
document so far I don't see any big

2076
02:03:19,449 --> 02:03:24,070
agreement on and none of the documents I

2077
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:26,469
would disagree with the last colony

2078
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:30,489
think there's a great base to start the

2079
02:03:26,469 --> 02:03:34,090
work okay going to take thank you thank

2080
02:03:30,489 --> 02:03:37,449
you so thank you for making us wet in

2081
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:40,139
such a cool the room and see you in

2082
02:03:37,449 --> 02:03:40,138
Singapore
