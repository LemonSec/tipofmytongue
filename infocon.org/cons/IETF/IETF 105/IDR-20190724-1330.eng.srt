1
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:18,810
okay okay it's 1:30 let's get started

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:23,259
so as we've all seen again and again

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:26,770
this is our note well please note it

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,990
well don't have anything funny to say

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,689
about it sorry

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:01:01,718
do we have an agenda to project are we

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:01:06,670
just going to dive right in what are we

8
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:09,970
looking for just that so you can just

9
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:14,010
pull it up off this one scroll down to

10
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:17,140
the hearing I mean if you want to start

11
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,280
yeah I'm talking about one side well I'm

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,280
pulling this up you can do that

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:39,539
okay so I'm gonna start because I'm

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:43,590
gonna for my sins I'm sharing the IPSec

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,450
related work section and so John I think

16
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,630
you need we're going to go through

17
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,840
agenda bashing which is right now then

18
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,979
we're going to go through my

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,680
introduction to it which will take about

20
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,570
15 minutes in that if you're an IDR

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,940
person I've put a whole lot of detail

22
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,949
that gives you the tlvs but I'm going to

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,160
give the high level for the security

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,380
people because tlvs

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:13,560
may not be as important as the general

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:17,010
security then Jun who is going to give a

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,090
remote presentation on the IP sick

28
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,429
singled tunnel configuration then Linda

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,070
is going to give some more details on SD

30
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,530
when courts because I think use cases

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,650
are as important and then Ally and

32
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:36,090
they've are going to give a presentation

33
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,709
on the secure methodology for evpn at

34
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,230
which point we're going to have a

35
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:43,200
general discussion about the security

36
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,440
methodology and issues relating to bgp

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,649
VPNs versus other things I know this has

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,250
been talked about in sector and suffer

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,940
some things in excuse me set dispatch

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,160
not sector set dispatch earlier this

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:08,120
week so now you have to find my

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:13,260
presentation this one right here that's

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,989
okay this is I an overview of IP links

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,798
and VPNs for all of you who are IT are

45
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,660
people you know I used to when I had

46
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,510
young kids who've watched certain TV

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,790
shows and there was two levels of

48
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,840
presentation one was for the parents and

49
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,090
one was for the kids and I liked it

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,100
because there was that sort of fun well

51
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,020
this you're all adults but the

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,000
I put in enough details that if you're

53
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,300
an ITR person you can read the details

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,300
but I'll be talking at the at the higher

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,850
level so we can interact with our

56
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,620
security brethren the drafts we're

57
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:57,500
considering our drafts agasi best

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:04:01,460
secured evpn dref who's une idée our bgp

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,200
IPSec and Dunbar ID rs1 there are

60
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,860
supporting drafts you have to realize

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,470
there are supporting drafts for the

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,650
secure VPN from draft Carol IPSec

63
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:16,040
controller there are some core I work

64
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,620
from I 2 and a SEF for an IPSec flow

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,280
controller and then there is supporting

66
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,770
work in bgp from the tunnel and a usage

67
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,130
case from dart andar so we'll just sort

68
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,530
of reference these I'm expecting you to

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,950
to read if your ID are to know how to

70
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,440
navigate a draft and find it's

71
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,450
supporting things the rest of it so why

72
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,940
are this meeting and you saw this in the

73
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:44,390
best working group we have multiple

74
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,930
overlapping protocols on IPSec in best

75
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:53,120
IDR and I to NSF I to NSF is really

76
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,920
looking at device controller a security

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,480
controller controlling many secure

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,280
devices so we got this in our 80s said

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,680
you know let's go work it out so the

80
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,619
best an idea our chairs agreed that calm

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,590
until these four idea are tunnel and

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,440
camp should be agreed upon in IDR which

83
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,150
means we need to agree in IDR that

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,280
that's the right place because the

85
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,880
tunnel and caps draft belongs to us

86
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,219
belongs to the IDR working group the SI

87
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,850
mechanisms need to be harmonized across

88
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,280
the three drafts but but the idea the

89
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,290
IDR on best chairs admit full well we

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,780
are not security experts I know you may

91
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:36,110
find that's unusual from the security

92
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,590
that we admit on unknowingness but we

93
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,360
are and then we have to determine in a

94
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:46,250
subsequent thing whether the NRI

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,800
requests in draft unbar IDR Sdn port so

96
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,690
this is why you're here we're trying to

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,930
do the second we're going to try to give

98
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,889
you

99
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,500
the various security mechanisms we do

100
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,080
not ask for an immediate answer we ask

101
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,699
for you to give us a sort of opinion if

102
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,000
you think this is a longer discussion

103
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,410
with the security people we should let

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,650
us know but we're trying to get a

105
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:12,050
scoping okay now this is mom and apple

106
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,299
pie for all the IDR folks but I thought

107
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,419
I should throw in a few introductions

108
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,669
this is the basic topology you have

109
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,460
IPSec tunnels those are the things that

110
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:26,240
they to go through goes through you have

111
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,880
bgp peering in some cases the BGP peers

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,509
talk directly to one another and in many

113
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,349
of the secure VPN and the sd1 case they

114
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:38,360
talk to an arc of BGP route effector BGP

115
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:42,740
route effectors are our mechanism by

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,110
which we scale I've we scale

117
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,720
tremendously so I think I've gone

118
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,530
through the fact that that the sigasi

119
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:56,120
graph is a secure VPN that the Dunbar

120
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,820
Draft is the sd1 and that June whose

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,780
graph is trying to make management

122
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,900
provisioning and management of large

123
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:07,719
numbers notice all of these say large

124
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:11,960
numbers large numbers of BGP based

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,080
secure VPNs with large numbers of IPSec

126
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,979
mesh tunnels who believes he can do it

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,109
with simpler tunnels and he can do it

128
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,880
without a centralized controller the

129
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,550
question is that's on a controller for

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:32,419
BGP what about a controller for the

131
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,810
security control as i2 NSF has began to

132
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:38,299
specify one note I have to have as I am

133
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,610
co-author on one of these drafts but in

134
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,860
this session I won't be answering that

135
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,800
draft in order to keep it clean I'm

136
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,960
acting as a working group controller so

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,780
if you ask the question toward that

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,580
draft you have to ask my co-authors okay

139
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,799
so how do we look at this we look at the

140
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,840
use case the architecture the security

141
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,389
issues the hierarchy and the BGP

142
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,919
mechanisms I need to give your security

143
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,880
folks heads-up we are replacing the BGP

144
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,270
implement

145
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:12,200
for tunnelling with the draft IDR tunnel

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:15,140
attribute it is essentially looking to

147
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,599
replace the encapsulated extended

148
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,419
communities but BGP lives in an

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,480
environment of deployment we deploy

150
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,160
things and we get implementations and

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,350
that's when we finalize the

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,700
standardization so a lot of these

153
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:34,460
wonderful things it's described secure

154
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,770
VPNs have already been deployed so in

155
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,050
that case they may be going with the

156
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,120
encapsulated in its extended community

157
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,599
but in the future we are hoping that

158
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,580
people will transition to the draft IDR

159
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,170
tunnel attribute why because there's

160
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,310
some better security around the

161
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,530
attribute okay okay this is a general

162
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,310
architecture that comes from the secure

163
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,750
VPN but seems to be followed there's a

164
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,760
zero touch bring up there's a

165
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,520
configuration management there's an

166
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,680
orchestration and signaling for PGP

167
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:12,199
folks during the the the non security

168
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,140
Association section you can ask

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,900
questions about that there are two types

170
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:22,640
of things there is a one administrative

171
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:25,790
domain IP security function that June

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,160
who is proposing that's within a single

173
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,680
administrative domain that may have

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,680
multiple asses but it is within one

175
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,170
administrative domain and that's a

176
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,410
definition the secure a VPN and the Sdn

177
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,370
goes through multiple a SS and multiple

178
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:46,790
domains okay so there - there's a range

179
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,120
of these security issues so if you're

180
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,520
reviewing one you need to know whether

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,340
what context you're in are you going

182
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,370
across multiple administrative domains

183
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,950
and administrative means this guy owns

184
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,860
it he owns the security for all the

185
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,920
boxes and he owns all the BGP stuff in

186
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,650
the secure VPN and the SD LAN case they

187
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,140
may be going between two places perhaps

188
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,650
two carriers perhaps two cloud providers

189
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,689
the security issues that I as a chair

190
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,340
and this is just my

191
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:23,390
first stab in the dark fall into two

192
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,750
characteristics you can have a

193
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,790
controller two device you can sis and

194
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,480
and and there are some assumptions here

195
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,939
we assume that the route reflector which

196
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,640
is the thing I'll show you that is like

197
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:41,570
the controller can securely identify the

198
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,610
other node we assume that that is part

199
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,380
of the operation in these architectures

200
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,620
we assume that they're setting up

201
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,020
traffic's selection policy that's part

202
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,530
of normal routing we determine where you

203
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:58,910
can send traffic how we do it a lot of

204
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:02,569
the yang policy distribution that's

205
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,209
being worked on by the routing working

206
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,990
group is doing some policy Jeff wave

207
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:11,270
your hand

208
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:14,840
he's the routing working group person

209
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,930
that's working on policy that policy

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,350
distribution is being has configuration

211
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:24,349
and yang and can be run over the yang

212
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:28,370
secure topology just as if you had I to

213
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,880
NSF he's got the policy language en

214
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,320
description that's not the type of

215
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,200
capabilities that might come from I to

216
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,410
NSF now if you set up the security

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,790
databases they could be downloaded

218
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:47,270
outside you unions a draft does suggest

219
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,520
that and but those are places you should

220
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,100
look at us you should say do we know

221
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,920
what we're doing there do you think we

222
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,470
can have it conflict also could occur

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,959
between two mechanisms you could have -

224
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,810
I - + SF mechanisms conflicting with

225
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,780
yourself and there's a way to work on

226
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,119
that you could have two bgp mechanisms

227
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,360
that are singling these here give secure

228
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,220
VPNs you could have one of each the goal

229
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,240
in all of this is to have non

230
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:20,210
overlapping policy roles or rules if you

231
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,089
have it that in in routing we call it

232
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:26,210
preference if I got top reference and we

233
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:29,390
have a conflict I win so the routing

234
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,089
people are used to that and I think I

235
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,059
went through the tunnel attribute

236
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,009
but in our attributes we do have some

237
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,709
policy that we've been working on

238
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,779
we have validation of origin ID because

239
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:43,959
these are tracked by a route and

240
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,509
filtering as I just described or if you

241
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:48,939
want to get into the BGP second

242
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:51,309
vironment you could signature various

243
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:53,498
portions of the data by what I'm meaning

244
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:56,618
to the security people is this is the

245
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:59,829
data portion of BGP the links are

246
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:02,109
secured via IP second most of these

247
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:05,348
proposals you know whatever they're

248
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:07,779
distributing it and the but beyond that

249
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:09,969
we have data securing for the packets

250
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:12,729
that go through BGP because the data is

251
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:20,229
end-to-end and can be done okay

252
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:22,299
just for fun this I I i dr folks i took

253
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:24,819
a look at all the hierarchy and there's

254
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:27,129
hierarchy in most all of it and i've

255
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:29,019
laid it down there that's my best

256
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:31,089
reading of the drafts please tell me if

257
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,579
you think they're wrong for the security

258
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:38,079
folks notice we have significant

259
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:42,939
hierarchy because we have to scale in ib

260
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:46,478
sec we passed some data in bgp tlvs we

261
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:49,209
passed tunnel type we pass port

262
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:52,269
distinguisher in some repents nonce data

263
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:54,279
we pass tree key we do a key exchange

264
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:58,629
and we have SI transforms those are

265
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:03,159
actually being passed and the BGP PDUs

266
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:06,009
that are being passed okay we have some

267
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:09,669
open issues for the working group to

268
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:13,629
deal with some of our because our ID our

269
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:15,909
tunneling caption is being obsoleted

270
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:17,469
some of these drafts are being revved so

271
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,929
if you have comments on some of this

272
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:22,779
stuff we could catch something in there

273
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:25,358
but our current tunnel types based on

274
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,249
the change of ID our tunnel

275
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:29,559
encapsulation some of them have to be

276
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:32,499
read for IDR look at the number of

277
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:35,919
drafts we have to now fix now that if we

278
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:38,229
get tunnel and caption through bgp

279
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,019
secure requirements now this I'm going

280
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:43,629
to stop and focus on I put a little

281
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,889
later in the slides because just before

282
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:47,790
you see all the

283
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:51,009
requirements we have scalability issues

284
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,209
we have 10 K notes they oftentimes and

285
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,670
these things have a hundred million

286
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,469
links have a hundred thousand links we

287
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,628
have 10 million routes and maybe 20

288
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,410
million end customers this is not the

289
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:04,899
scale of a 1 even a small network these

290
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,699
are massive networks our robustness is

291
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:12,369
five nines in case you've never heard

292
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:14,439
that term it's 99.999 percent uptime you

293
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:17,139
have to have ready to go key management

294
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:19,118
sa on-the-fly within milliseconds that

295
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,249
may not be possible that sure is the

296
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:24,549
desire of the customer reoccurring

297
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:27,369
occurs this is not a static drop and go

298
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:29,290
this is a dynamic creaking there's a

299
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:32,169
separate path for control and data that

300
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,379
is hard baked into the scalability of

301
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:37,449
BGP route reflectors and there is

302
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:40,259
network topology with non directional

303
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:43,299
links because of data throughput issues

304
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:46,389
this is this is a complex environment

305
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,879
I've just said that ton of stuff there

306
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,889
if you're a security person and you want

307
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,249
to ask me what all this means it's

308
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:56,759
scaling with the star and it means that

309
00:15:54,249 --> 00:16:00,970
some of your assumptions on BGP the

310
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:03,029
IPSec VPNs has a different twist when we

311
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,529
get to be chipiya VPNs

312
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:08,889
BGP is a control plan this is again

313
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:11,079
basics and respect for our our security

314
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,600
brethren who have kindly come the

315
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,638
compelling reasons for using BGP is BGP

316
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,369
is widely deployed it has a reliable

317
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,069
transport it is a guaranteed order it

318
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:23,619
could be run or mandated to be run over

319
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:26,618
the best of TCP we're not going to go

320
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:28,569
into that you can we're going to go into

321
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:32,739
what happens after you have a secure

322
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:35,679
link the protocol runs on top of TCP it

323
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:37,389
has incremental updates that are as I've

324
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,980
mentioned several times and I probably

325
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:44,980
am repeating myself here the routing

326
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,980
reflector which means routes go up to a

327
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,109
central controller and then our

328
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,049
distributed reduces the full flag full

329
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:55,149
mesh and the route table size so we have

330
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:57,789
to have that and we have to have

331
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,520
security built in route reflectors have

332
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,890
the

333
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,160
to apply policy to communication that's

334
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,790
part of our DNA already and that last

335
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,280
face it's not three hours it's two hours

336
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:13,060
VG p plus route reflectors support many

337
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,849
types of topologies hub spoke mesh

338
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,220
anything else I've met missed our secure

339
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,770
VPN folks will pick up for me the

340
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:28,300
implementations are robust widely

341
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:34,330
accepted they go from data centers to to

342
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:39,200
corporate networks to mom-and-pop shops

343
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:42,379
they're it's flexible why are we asking

344
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,900
you to help you just probably got it

345
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,330
this is a longer conversation some

346
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,420
things of what I was trying to get us to

347
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,909
get to you may have already because the

348
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,240
Carroll draft is specified it for secure

349
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,430
VPN and Sdn leverages the Carroll draft

350
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,980
you may have an understanding of this in

351
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,980
detail they shortened it up seeing that

352
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,810
you'd seen it a few times but these are

353
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,720
the things I tried to look at what you

354
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:10,970
were requiring if you had something more

355
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,580
and you want us to work toward it please

356
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,490
do we're looking at generating IPSec

357
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,970
essays rekeying IV sec database

358
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:23,000
generation both SPD security policy and

359
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,970
s ad we're looking at peer author author

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,760
a ssin database and policy distribution

361
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:32,420
kudos to june he filled out all of us

362
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,680
for the domain there is the bgp security

363
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,750
issues that when you have an

364
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,270
implementation you need to check the box

365
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,960
whether you're doing origin filtering

366
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:45,200
that will require a link to the PKI or

367
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,150
something nearby it you need filters to

368
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,700
string out attacks those have to be

369
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,550
downloaded could that could be part of

370
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,640
an i2 and s download as one of the

371
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:59,899
capabilities and you have nested tunnels

372
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,490
did I say Nestor tunnels okay so with

373
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,670
the hierarchy you should realize that

374
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:08,630
nested tunnels are part of our life

375
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,920
they are nested sometimes six and seven

376
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:15,490
layers deep I will take a quick

377
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:18,430
jetpack and notice this hierarchy is

378
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:23,680
about seven layers you can have people

379
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:24,400
going that far in thank you and I will

380
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:39,670
be done

381
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:42,010
it is now jeans turn yes the slides yes

382
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:50,200
we're projecting them off the meeting

383
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:55,570
materials it's it's in the materials

384
00:19:50,200 --> 00:20:01,300
there in the Friday session Jim thank

385
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:03,220
you Jim yeah really loud and clear okay

386
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:11,290
you can even back off a little

387
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:14,050
oh thank you guys so my obsession is

388
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:16,860
really about the draft I wrote regarding

389
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:22,930
to signal the opposite complete by bgp

390
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:25,750
so next slide please so basically the

391
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,870
draft defines a message bgp to second

392
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:33,820
certain IPSec configuration along with

393
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:38,919
the NRI that will be updates it relies

394
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:43,899
on the GP tunneling cups is dropped for

395
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:46,390
the IPSec confusion and HP is only used

396
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,550
to you know it's projecting really loud

397
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,320
try to back off on your voice we can't

398
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:59,980
seem to figure out how to back off the

399
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:02,590
media Quahog okay okay so bitch be here

400
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:06,100
is in this draft is only used to signal

401
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,949
the config art of that music the actual

402
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,949
IPSec tunnel is still created by the

403
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,480
acquittal particle between the routers

404
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,960
that using EGP so really there's no

405
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,430
change on how IPSec tano is credit this

406
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,860
is still using I could be to and

407
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,830
everything

408
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,169
regarding our IP set work stays saying

409
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,980
there's no change on the IPSec part the

410
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:35,309
only thing I proposed in the draft is on

411
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:40,830
how to use BCE to signal the conflicts

412
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:43,379
at the convict of the IPSec so here the

413
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:47,820
list of the sub theories I propose that

414
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:51,420
we use two signals IPSec complete first

415
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:56,189
we can use the existing data type for

416
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:59,040
the IPSec tile which is a web form

417
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:02,760
yes little amount I did not accrue the

418
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:06,299
ashtar because it's hardly used in the

419
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:10,020
deployments and plus IH does not provide

420
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,940
the complete confidential protections so

421
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,870
I only put yes Python oh here in the

422
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:20,250
draft and also there are three new sub

423
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:22,770
theories I proposed underneath the

424
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,010
Italian caption attribute first why is

425
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:28,470
the public audiences so this sub theory

426
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,020
is basically is a rocking target to

427
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:37,140
indicate where the encapsulated IPSec

428
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:42,330
market before in because in the comments

429
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:44,400
IPSec the public side of IPSec different

430
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:47,100
from the public private side of the

431
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,559
IPSec this is a convenient way Dumbo you

432
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,230
could follow I kiss effect in one of the

433
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,540
VPNs

434
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,450
which slightly you on yeah this is a

435
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:03,090
slight the tree did this area showing

436
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:04,530
here yep okay we're fine yeah but your

437
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,049
payload packet back home from the

438
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,350
different total total different route

439
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:12,480
instance the second new tier II sub

440
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,629
theory is the remote address prefix sub

441
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,900
theory which is from the receiver point

442
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:27,299
of view so basically this is the IPSec

443
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:29,940
traffic selector like TSI and then

444
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,668
there's another one for the remote for

445
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,070
the local traffic

446
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:36,310
selector which is a local car local

447
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,830
address prefix

448
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:43,090
suppose this to nutrients of theory is

449
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:46,000
basically contain one or more IP prefix

450
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:51,370
that we use for the basic traffic

451
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,860
selector and there are some existing sub

452
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,280
theory I propose to reuse for the IPSec

453
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,350
config so why is the tunnel in point so

454
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,750
basically this is now the IPSec tunnel

455
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,449
endpoint address and then there's a

456
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:09,910
color so color here in my draft is

457
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:12,280
really aggregation for all other IPSec

458
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:15,640
config but not specifically mentioned

459
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:20,560
here because I do not want to introduce

460
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:26,650
too much change on the beach P site and

461
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:31,120
plus in most case the like transform

462
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:34,360
like lifetime they are all same on the

463
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,169
all parties participating routers they

464
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,550
are all same config so you have one

465
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,780
stead of those co-efficient or you have

466
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,610
a multiple set of this country but

467
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,200
typically you know we have same

468
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,899
completion for every participating

469
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,600
routers so which means I can actually

470
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,570
simplify this by just using a color to

471
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,530
signify that that's the collection of

472
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:58,389
those configure configurations so there

473
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,200
are two approach here one is the using

474
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:04,740
existing color sub theories another

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,560
approach that to just introduced a new

476
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,670
color subcarrier just 5p SEC to avoid

477
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:15,310
the confusion of using the existing

478
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:19,390
subtly and then last part is the

479
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:22,570
embedded label Henry so for the VPN

480
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:26,400
browse ipv4 will be 6 ppm rafts which

481
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:29,470
has embedded labels in the BG update

482
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,440
which is used to identify in the data

483
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:37,450
path which not instance or which will

484
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:41,320
appear in this packet belongs to but

485
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,000
here 5e sec encapsulation ab second not

486
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,750
really encapsulate that packet will be

487
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,700
the labels IP stack the only only IP IP

488
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,370
packet can be encapsulated inside ivy

489
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,520
Sopranos

490
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:56,330
so here I proposed we should ignore that

491
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,990
label contains it in the European routes

492
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:02,860
because with IPSec the China's say could

493
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:06,830
already identify which of the instance

494
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:09,010
that packets allows to so you don't

495
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:13,220
really need that additional label and

496
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:15,950
update so I propose to use that value to

497
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:20,570
of the embedded label had enduring sub

498
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:29,690
tier V to signal such process so next

499
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:33,350
slide so here's a table I created two

500
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:40,070
mapping between the needed IPSec config

501
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:42,740
to the BGP signal config so for the Ike

502
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:45,560
for all the I conflict like as they

503
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,200
transform like authentication Messer to

504
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,840
render shows lifetimes in cetera like

505
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,930
the NDP D those are all aggregated by

506
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,760
the color sub TV or we if we decide to

507
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,360
music use a new sub theory for this

508
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,490
purpose for try the same public forum is

509
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,939
vital on it's a channel type field in

510
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,610
the tano in cups H cute for the child as

511
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,400
they transform that's also a group made

512
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,610
by the color and for the traffic

513
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,250
selector local remote and this type of

514
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:20,439
there should be one local in a one

515
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:24,290
remote Travis Lecter address range which

516
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,860
signal Bibles those new sub theories

517
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:30,610
mentioned in previous slide for these

518
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:34,090
traps Lecter protocol in the pot range

519
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:37,429
it's not second out it's as soon as any

520
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:39,800
so which means the only only chopped

521
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:44,240
selector favorite we signal Y which P is

522
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:46,220
the address range or prefix for the

523
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,860
entire play config is a degrade by the

524
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:55,270
color ESL the config is also a delete by

525
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:57,740
the color next slide so here the table

526
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:02,290
showed in the previous slides that I

527
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:04,120
fear out so the general

528
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:07,720
of the initial every success ace is

529
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,540
based on the routing lookup so based on

530
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,030
the you would rather neutral for the

531
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,430
packet he will do a rotten lookup and if

532
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:18,910
we decide to using a particular bgp

533
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:21,090
update and that update has a IPSec can

534
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,370
encapsulate suit then he will use that

535
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:28,179
confusion to create a tree sectional by

536
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:31,149
a 3-2 and that penetration will created

537
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:37,630
the initial I can say and try to stay

538
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:39,790
and Ricky's Oh psych I say and try to

539
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:43,180
say Ricky we're down by a tree - based

540
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:46,440
on the config that we using in the

541
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,360
tunnel creation time sticking on by the

542
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,970
color some theory

543
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,300
so basically typically you will use

544
00:28:51,970 --> 00:29:02,190
lifetime paste ricky mechanism so that

545
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:02,190
lifetime use signal by the color also

546
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,820
there's not much difference between

547
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,090
single device Ricky and about device

548
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,310
Ricky because all the Ricky's here is

549
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:16,620
that down while standard Acme to

550
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:18,940
operations the device weekly visits tano

551
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,879
Pierce there's no involvement of any

552
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:26,290
third party device it really happened

553
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:30,580
between these two ton appear for the

554
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:32,889
different IPSec database for SPD is a

555
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,919
Accenture signal by the NRI

556
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:39,910
which is routes local prefix and the

557
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:43,090
remote prefix sub theories why stay D

558
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,980
SATs actually the China says I try to

559
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,600
say that create a dynamic day when that

560
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:51,850
could be to create a no or when the

561
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:54,520
tried ASAP happens and whenever whenever

562
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,959
a new try to say or trying to say Ricky

563
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:04,510
happens the new set of keys mass SP are

564
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:08,170
generally dynamically for the peering

565
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:13,560
database PID this is a signal by the

566
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:15,760
talent points of theory for the policy

567
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,330
policy distribution

568
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,720
the advertising rouse signal these IPSec

569
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:26,559
config it requires other to use when

570
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:31,779
reaching the NI advice so basically a

571
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,950
router advise certain brows and along

572
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:35,529
with those little rough

573
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,019
it also advised what can I protect a no

574
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:41,950
you need to use in order to reach this

575
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:43,750
route this could be done with our

576
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:49,179
without our ax because it's just

577
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:51,190
standard BGP updates the receiver use

578
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,470
normal BGP routing lookup mechanism to

579
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,419
decide which update to use so in case

580
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,149
let's say if there are multiple routes a

581
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:01,450
multiple router would advise the same

582
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:04,059
routes but with different IPSec config

583
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,130
then receiver just using standard which

584
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:11,010
pin mechanism elect with them who pacing

585
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:14,740
based on the preference to select one to

586
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:20,230
use and use the corresponding I pista

587
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:23,110
config in that update so next slide for

588
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:26,130
the security issues relate to this

589
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,389
approach so all the standard BGP

590
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,269
security makanda could be used to he has

591
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:36,389
the security of the BGP updates like

592
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:39,639
origin verification filter which we sack

593
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:42,149
for the nested tunnels just like at the

594
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:45,820
top type tunnels that you signal by BGP

595
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:50,620
you have to pay attention to avoid

596
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:52,779
looping because in case there are

597
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,809
multiple nested tunnels and there will

598
00:31:52,779 --> 00:32:00,039
be multiple BGP updates you have to be

599
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:04,330
careful not to make a loop out of it so

600
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:06,360
basically you have to either

601
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,860
intentionally or intentionally

602
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,620
misconfigurations that might cause the

603
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,620
loop next slide

604
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,730
so my draft is really focused on the

605
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:27,360
single and is read to me but for if you

606
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:30,090
want to have it work across the division

607
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,639
to me the only thing and if you make

608
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,800
sure is that the mapping between the

609
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,890
color and opposite configuration and

610
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,680
read and also I didn't put it here but

611
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:45,200
it's also important we have a common set

612
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:48,570
of syndication framework and credentials

613
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,190
policies for example let's say you if

614
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,580
you're using certificate or syndication

615
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:57,390
you make sure this two organization

616
00:32:52,580 --> 00:33:01,409
trustees charges RCA's and it's seen

617
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:04,110
issuing certificates as long as you can

618
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,870
do those things I mean this draft could

619
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:08,669
also work across administer to me but

620
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:13,949
typically you want to do the draft in

621
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:15,540
the same and mr. Toomy so the

622
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,760
distribution of traffic selection policy

623
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:22,170
is by the at fighting router because

624
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:26,129
again the main use case of this draft is

625
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:30,240
that if you don't have any central

626
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:32,460
controller and this is just like a

627
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,980
normal routing like traditional route

628
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,230
inheriting works each route Todd makes

629
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,150
their own decisions and also make the

630
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,059
whole decision of how what kind

631
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,880
protection they want to have for this

632
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,940
routes they advise so the advisor outer

633
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,740
will decide what kind of traffic

634
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:55,559
selection policy is able to use and the

635
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:58,350
they receive all those raw rapidly rafts

636
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,899
and need to you have to use those a

637
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:04,439
piece a config but including that those

638
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:09,409
big updates to reach those prefix those

639
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:12,260
routes because the receiver will enforce

640
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:16,050
Authority advising a lot of reinforced

641
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,179
the check of the receiving traffic that

642
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:21,169
if the single traffic comply with that

643
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:24,168
mister config that it the device

644
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,168
individuals

645
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:31,139
for the controller conflicts so again if

646
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:34,620
Toros advice same NRA but with different

647
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:39,710
config in computers or by the normal BGP

648
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:42,810
mechanisms for between and bitch PE so

649
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:46,020
if there's such confliction between the

650
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,449
this draft and another mechanism for

651
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,270
example local provision or prison

652
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:54,658
foreign controller I mean this is really

653
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:57,090
local matters is up to the intubation to

654
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:59,490
decide which one to prefer and typically

655
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,560
we would say for example if you have a

656
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,259
local configured a piece of configure

657
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,840
the overlap with the beach be signaled

658
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:12,090
mister config typically you would want

659
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:15,600
favor the local config once and then for

660
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:17,700
the last part the day or touch setup

661
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,060
so the trust this drug does not actually

662
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,120
actually address the attached provision

663
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,790
because it requires some pre provisions

664
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,319
before this could work for example you

665
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,380
need to provision pretty provisions the

666
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,540
color to IPSec config mappings and also

667
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:38,270
you need to pre provision the IPSec

668
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,270
authentication mechanism its credentials

669
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,689
but it could be a facilitate the

670
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:49,410
attachment provision the only because

671
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:53,550
you only we only require the relative

672
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:56,220
static config because the authentication

673
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,930
credential and color mapping it's it's

674
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,870
typically is common for all the routers

675
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,330
and typically it won't change very

676
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:07,680
frequently so you could actually prepare

677
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:10,500
users by other means other routers but

678
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:15,000
have this dynamic part like like the

679
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:20,700
trophy selectors and those things still

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,460
go by the BB for all those good pieces

681
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,060
of information folks for the security

682
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,080
folks will give you a bit of a moment to

683
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,490
investigate that unless you have a

684
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,819
burning question we'll take all

685
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,140
questions at the end

686
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,640
clarifying questions yeah if you have

687
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,990
clarifying questions related to this

688
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,118
draft then now is a good time other

689
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:44,799
as will as sue said take questions at

690
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:48,610
the end no one approaching the mic so

691
00:36:44,800 --> 00:37:12,010
thanks and we'll go on to who's our next

692
00:36:48,610 --> 00:37:14,890
one okay that's good thank you

693
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:18,970
so here I'm only going to talk about

694
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:21,100
user scenarios key requirements and I

695
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,368
know we have some offline discussion how

696
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,650
do we encode the bits and information

697
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:38,670
I'll leave that later we'll talk about

698
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:42,940
later after at least dropped so okay so

699
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:45,790
the key things about sd1 I present this

700
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,119
in the RTG working group briefly on the

701
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:52,810
problem statement you're talking about

702
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:57,240
mati players you have service providers

703
00:37:52,810 --> 00:38:00,700
have the VPNs you have the ISPs for the

704
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:04,060
internet connections and you have call

705
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,970
provider offer connection from their

706
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,430
gateway respective gateway to your

707
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:14,259
virtual router and you have your CPE

708
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:16,600
device somewhere maybe on your campus or

709
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:23,109
maybe in a shopping mall maybe in some

710
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:26,890
remote office so the sty itself is about

711
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:29,920
the overlay as you can see here like for

712
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:33,339
example the MPLS network itself has the

713
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,920
UM PGP control that's the one bgp

714
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,710
version you can think about underlay BTP

715
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,030
layer and this dotted line dotted purple

716
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:46,000
line here is control the devices in very

717
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:48,460
different geographic locations you could

718
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,220
have one CPU located here in Montreal

719
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:55,550
and you could have your virtual CPE

720
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:58,459
located in some cloud data center in a

721
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:01,790
different country and you could have a

722
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,850
controller using some kind of TLS or

723
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:08,450
some kind of TTL s to be able to connect

724
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:11,360
to those two devices and then distribute

725
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:14,770
information distribute IPSec

726
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:18,170
configuration or IPSec key establishment

727
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:21,200
so here in this example I only show just

728
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:23,360
one cloud location one CP but in reality

729
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,649
as sue mentioned in the earlier slides

730
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:32,090
there could be many more than hundreds

731
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:35,660
more than thousands and in the past in

732
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,640
our deployment we use an HR PE to read

733
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,460
kind of resolve some of the addresses

734
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:44,240
and tunnels but once the network go

735
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,850
beyond 100 it doesn't scale anymore so

736
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,930
we retreat to be GP because BGP has been

737
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:56,060
proven can scale to much larger number

738
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:59,839
of nodes and sessions so that's some of

739
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:02,720
the key characteristics of this sd-1

740
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,300
here we call hybrid sd1 simply because

741
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,310
for this virtual router they can have

742
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:10,100
different ways to be connected

743
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:12,230
one is through secure network see if the

744
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,680
traffic goes through MPLS network and

745
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,390
through that they were connect to the

746
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,600
virtual router the traffic don't have to

747
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:23,569
be encrypted in packet goes that way

748
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:26,720
then they can go natively to have better

749
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:29,540
performance and if traffic have to go

750
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,020
through the internet then that has to be

751
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:36,529
encrypted so IPSec only apply to certain

752
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:40,730
traffic going through certain paths and

753
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:42,980
same same traffic maybe at in the

754
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,410
morning it goes through the private

755
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,370
networks through that they recollect to

756
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:51,980
the virtual router that Inc doesn't have

757
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:54,650
to be encrypted and then maybe later on

758
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:57,620
when the traffic condition in a private

759
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:01,130
network at congested may be shifted to

760
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:03,440
the public networks through IPSec then

761
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,900
that has to go through the encryption so

762
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,200
the policy

763
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:13,010
is a local decision from like CPU one

764
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,140
they have basically have different kind

765
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:18,620
of monitoring system which is beyond the

766
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:21,799
scope of IDR to monitor the network

767
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:24,560
condition monitor the application status

768
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:31,970
and then make local decisions on where

769
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:34,370
to send and for many many cloud a

770
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,919
today's application and there'll be many

771
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:40,580
components right so application

772
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:45,200
components can be instantiated at

773
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:47,390
different locations and same application

774
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,450
they may have multiple versions of it

775
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:55,160
much multiple instantiation of it and

776
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:58,480
based on some policy sometimes can be

777
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:03,140
regulatory requirement sometimes can be

778
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:06,650
performance issues and the the

779
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:10,100
connection can be site based like say

780
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,950
for example my traffic has goes through

781
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:16,370
certain sites because of I have to

782
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:20,509
comply to some regulatory requirement so

783
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:23,270
and for the sd1 like the virtual pass

784
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:27,200
the BGP connection had to take the site

785
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:30,740
into consideration on top of your note

786
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,879
ID on top of your port ID so there's

787
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:36,729
another layer site that's just another

788
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,760
requirement that has to be considered

789
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:44,450
for inter canal multi-cloud

790
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:47,000
interconnections and for example in this

791
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:51,439
example here I only show that from CPE

792
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,540
to cloud data's in the one and then

793
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,870
called a descender to the traffic

794
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:00,259
between the two cloud datacenter like

795
00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:02,270
VPN virtual virtual router in datas in

796
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,030
the one the virtual call in data center

797
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,009
to some kind need to be communicated and

798
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,540
there will be pass among them as well

799
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:14,840
and the passed among them can be

800
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:19,749
encrypted through the public network or

801
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:23,539
can be through the trusted network

802
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:25,910
so just in general this one has been

803
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:29,329
presented in the RTG working group is

804
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:32,480
about here just summarize two different

805
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:35,240
type of iced tea wine scenarios one is I

806
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:40,099
call homogeneous sd-1 meaning that oh

807
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:43,758
traffic I encrypted you have a CPE like

808
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:47,690
in a shopping mall all the traffic from

809
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:51,619
this particular device to my campus

810
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:55,339
network or to my other places are

811
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:59,690
encrypted and so it doesn't matter which

812
00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:03,349
one port you egress from another one we

813
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:07,759
call it hybrid network hybrid sd1

814
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:09,559
meaning that someone ports need to be

815
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:12,680
encryption to be encrypted

816
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:17,089
someone ports you don't so it's really

817
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,578
from one point one perspective from the

818
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:27,999
client side you have client attachment

819
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:31,880
which can go through either port so the

820
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:34,519
for the sd1 control playing the

821
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,759
peer-to-peer model doesn't work very

822
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:42,308
well simply because I have those kind of

823
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,730
virtual edges they actually can be

824
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:48,259
instantiated

825
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:51,200
in different places and in the overpass

826
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:54,349
multiple domains and so we need the

827
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,899
dotted line route reflector which he

828
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:58,789
runs at the different layers from the

829
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,829
underlay network to connect them

830
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:07,759
together and it's very important that

831
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:10,910
those devices when powered up be able to

832
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:14,989
have burned address they can reach to an

833
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:18,440
establish secure channel this is not

834
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:23,720
just for IPSec attributes only this is

835
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:26,930
for other purposes like policies who you

836
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,149
can talk to for example this are one

837
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,700
being instantiated he wants to send

838
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:33,050
communicate with certain applications he

839
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,569
doesn't even know where

840
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,640
the application is located because they

841
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:42,380
may all have their own private addresses

842
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:45,379
so the the sequence is our one has to

843
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:47,660
send those traffic requests to the to

844
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,780
the controller which is I call it raw

845
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:53,000
reflector simply because when BGP used a

846
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:56,020
BGP itself has the mechanism to

847
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,630
distribute controlling information and

848
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:02,420
so all the communication is not directly

849
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,550
through each other through peers and

850
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,820
it's really through the controller I

851
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:09,260
know that in a security dispatch

852
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,390
discussion there are people debating on

853
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,930
whether we should use controller or

854
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:17,299
should be peer to peer so just for your

855
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,819
information the controller is there even

856
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,850
if it's now for IPSec purpose or a piece

857
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:26,030
a key distribution a management it is

858
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:29,120
there for other purposes and also form

859
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:32,000
the route distribution like just like a

860
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,339
VPN you may have attached routes you

861
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,160
need to Republic eight that routes to

862
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,650
other peers which in your domain and

863
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,310
that's also so the wrong reflector

864
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:49,280
because the edge node don't know how to

865
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:52,840
reach to the other peers and and it's

866
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,510
important that for the edge node to

867
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:59,450
register his web port right my one for

868
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:02,930
today I have three one ports and one is

869
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:05,770
connect to the reconnect is the VLAN or

870
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:09,710
is a secure connection another one is

871
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:10,190
private address which need net another

872
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,500
one

873
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:15,560
maybe it's public address public IP

874
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,260
reachable and that but you can use that

875
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:22,850
trees establish them

876
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:26,380
IPSec tunnel so and then on top of that

877
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:31,210
for the ports which needs

878
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:31,210
encryption they need a pisac management

879
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:40,880
so so

880
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:42,890
for the one-port propagation as i

881
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,340
mentioned earlier is through controller

882
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:50,509
and see for example here I have CPU one

883
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:52,430
in dollars I have a CPU in Beijing CPE

884
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:55,040
one need to communicate with their

885
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:57,950
corresponding application and they need

886
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,460
to go go to the controller to figure out

887
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:03,589
where is the CP to and how what is the

888
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,020
public address for CPE two because they

889
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,420
are open they may have private addresses

890
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,720
and then through that they can

891
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:21,950
communicate be able to establish channel

892
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:27,580
you have questions okay that's the last

893
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:30,980
time okay so in terms of how do we

894
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:33,170
encode the information we have

895
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:36,440
discussions have lots of discussion with

896
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:39,440
Ali and we all agreed that using tunnel

897
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,630
in cap is the right way to move forward

898
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:45,680
and the later on I have a couple slides

899
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:48,800
showing different ways of doing it the

900
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,100
pros and cons of different ways so we

901
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,950
can defer that discussion to - later on

902
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:57,319
later time so today because lots of

903
00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:01,609
people from security are here our main

904
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:05,450
purpose is to maybe convinced you guys

905
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:09,160
that for the IPSec configuration it

906
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:13,910
should be controller facilitate it

907
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:20,060
peer-to-peer doesn't scale well did you

908
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:22,399
have a clarifying question maybe you can

909
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:26,630
expand a little bit on a need to signal

910
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,490
ran puts across a a provider networks I

911
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,370
mean you brought up a brilliant case

912
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:34,399
here whether you may want to shunt

913
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:36,350
traffic at over different ports at

914
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,260
certain time of the day are you

915
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:41,870
expecting to add that when you signal

916
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:47,420
that of course through the wine ports to

917
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:48,950
increase the chatter within BGP ok ok ok

918
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,410
so the one point

919
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:54,140
self actually it's not really when you

920
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:57,410
need to send traffic is really when a

921
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:01,009
note powered up because for the sd1

922
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:03,618
well the important requirement is zero

923
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:05,570
touch provisioning you put a box you

924
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:08,930
ship a box to your client to your

925
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:11,390
customer they power them supposedly they

926
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,089
were touch provisioning will require

927
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:17,960
that box to be able to be up functioning

928
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:21,259
so depending on this web box where they

929
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,770
are located see if they are behind a net

930
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:27,859
right so they need to tell send a signal

931
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:31,540
to the controller Rob reflector here's

932
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:34,578
my box here's my port I have three ports

933
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:37,099
functioning and the port one is actually

934
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:39,410
is a private address and but my net

935
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:41,450
property is this I can go using some

936
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:44,328
kind of mechanism I have detailed in the

937
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,910
draft showing that a mechanism to detect

938
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:51,650
Manette property so I tell the

939
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:55,848
controller so in this example here I

940
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:58,069
want to make sure that you III heard the

941
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:01,010
question slightly separately did you get

942
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:03,609
the answer to what you have I think

943
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,650
we'll have to delay the the detailed

944
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:09,200
scenarios offline but did you get the

945
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:11,210
answer no I did it would be good if you

946
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,520
can send out an email on a mailing list

947
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:16,460
explaining it that would be also the

948
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,829
interest of time you question is the

949
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,780
need to signal and if you're gonna

950
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:22,970
signal it because the other end really

951
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,920
doesn't care it works on the routing so

952
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:27,109
what's the need to signal and if you're

953
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,670
gonna signal are you going to add what's

954
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:31,160
the indication on the charter of the

955
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,650
right bus so the challenge on the

956
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:36,410
creaking of the challenge or just to do

957
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:38,420
it at all okay we've got the question

958
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:41,210
we'll pick that up later Thank You Linda

959
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:52,130
for okay good presentation thank you

960
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:55,069
thank you very much the listing in the

961
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:57,829
agenda is Ali but Ali and Dave are gonna

962
00:51:55,069 --> 00:52:00,790
tag-team maybe it'll be more

963
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:00,790
entertaining that way

964
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:17,690
[Music]

965
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:19,940
so let me just think of easier so we got

966
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:25,550
the shortest presentation but it takes

967
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:28,040
two of us to present I'm not going to be

968
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:30,920
presenting what is on the agenda which

969
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:35,000
is security VPN because security pian is

970
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:40,070
a solution and it is talks about Harvey

971
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,920
doing the point to multi-point signaling

972
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:45,800
over bgp to set up the point-to-point

973
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:49,010
IPSec essays and it talks about the

974
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,740
details so before getting into the

975
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:53,990
Harvey do it we need to talk about what

976
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,089
we are doing it and why we are doing it

977
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:58,339
and given that this is Mike picking

978
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,670
Ellie up everybody can you hear me all

979
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,560
right okay thank you and this is given

980
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:07,100
that this is a joint session between the

981
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:09,560
security and BGP team I like to keep it

982
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:12,980
at the high level making sure everybody

983
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:17,960
is on board with the what and boy and

984
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:21,350
then later beginning to the half if I

985
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:24,920
start with the architecture component

986
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:27,980
which is not also in this s why it

987
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,660
basically we are talking about the three

988
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:35,090
four main components one is zero touch

989
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,339
for visioning such that when you have a

990
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:40,760
edge device you can just turn the power

991
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:43,520
on and goes to his ztp server gets the

992
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,290
info where to get the configuration and

993
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,520
then the next component is a

994
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:52,550
configuration component that HD version

995
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,670
gets a configuration component from it

996
00:53:52,550 --> 00:54:02,020
over the secure Channel and then third

997
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:06,350
is a signaling component that deals with

998
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:11,230
signaling the information we need to set

999
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:14,210
up the IPSec si as well as to do the

1000
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:17,240
keying reeking

1001
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:19,070
and so forth and these are the three

1002
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,830
main components and with the

1003
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:27,020
provisioning you know we defer that to I

1004
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:29,869
to NSF with the gtp it is outside of the

1005
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:32,119
scope and though and so the signaling is

1006
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:34,220
what we're gonna emphasize in here and

1007
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:40,160
we're going to talk about why we want to

1008
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:45,740
use BGP to set up these IPSec to set up

1009
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:49,819
these IPSec assays so a little bit of

1010
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:53,060
the background that I started the EVP

1011
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,859
and about 13 14 years ago and that

1012
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:59,109
goddess started as a research project

1013
00:54:54,859 --> 00:55:03,980
and right now it is very prevalent in

1014
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:09,529
data center in SP and in Enterprise is

1015
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:11,990
basically the facto overlay controls for

1016
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:15,250
Oracle and solution one of it has many

1017
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:17,868
reasons one of the reason is btp okay

1018
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:21,290
with respect to the capability it has

1019
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:24,230
with respect to is proven SQL proven

1020
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:30,940
functionality flexibility all that

1021
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:37,609
goodies okay so that with the same

1022
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:40,670
principle we want to leverage that for

1023
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:43,160
the security aspects when we want to add

1024
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:50,060
the security feature and secure the

1025
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:53,598
tunnels we currently use one signaling

1026
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:59,480
mechanism and this BGP and there has

1027
00:55:53,599 --> 00:56:01,790
been presidents before that in the last

1028
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:06,619
15-20 years for the people who've been

1029
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:08,930
around okay we solution had two

1030
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:13,570
signaling mechanism such as for the

1031
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:18,560
multicast VPN we did both PGP and we did

1032
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:21,530
PIM and we converge to BGP for the l2

1033
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,049
VPN with a targeted LDP and BGP for

1034
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:27,920
discovery then we converge to the BGP

1035
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:31,130
and many other instances this one

1036
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,700
we have a BGP we set up the use the BGP

1037
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:37,700
to set up many tunnels and for the IPSec

1038
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,439
tunnel is only one tunnel among many

1039
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:44,450
that we set up and we want to leverage

1040
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,220
the same signaling in here and some of

1041
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:50,569
the customers basically not they're not

1042
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:52,730
only asking using just the protocol the

1043
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:57,440
signaling protocol to be BGP but also

1044
00:56:52,730 --> 00:57:02,380
even to use a single Hafiz a fee or for

1045
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:06,620
example a single solution within that so

1046
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:21,800
that is basically the motivation to use

1047
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:23,830
BGP in here next please sure so I came

1048
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,050
at this from the sty inside of our house

1049
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:28,790
we've we developed st wan's not using

1050
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:32,450
BGP but with a really similar

1051
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:34,040
architecture we've got a management

1052
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:38,230
station that would be very analogous to

1053
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:40,430
what a knight to NSF does we've got our

1054
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:42,740
orchestrators that work very much like a

1055
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:45,710
route reflector does and we send around

1056
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,149
our are keying updates and our routing

1057
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:50,420
updates for the overlay network

1058
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:52,340
altogether it is entirely you know

1059
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:56,870
analogous to what we're proposing here

1060
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:59,150
with threw out reflectors so we have a

1061
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:01,520
key exchange protocol for those who

1062
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:04,850
weren't insect dispatch or IPSec amia a

1063
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,470
year or so ago there is a draft on our

1064
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:12,080
key exchange protocol that we've put out

1065
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:15,049
the the rationale for this is keeping it

1066
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,850
controller based we did this because of

1067
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:19,220
scalability as Olli was talking about

1068
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:22,400
that's kind of the primary functionality

1069
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:24,830
for it everybody talks to a central

1070
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,930
controller those are replicated they

1071
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:28,640
communicate with each other they push

1072
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:31,190
the information down and we got the

1073
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,410
scale that we need it there are other

1074
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:35,690
there are other needs that we that this

1075
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:37,609
met we don't want to drop packets

1076
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:40,580
obviously when something comes through

1077
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:41,420
and you need a session established we

1078
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,270
don't have we don't

1079
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,829
spend the time to do six round trips or

1080
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:48,079
three round trips or whatever we're

1081
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:51,589
going to do we want those packets to

1082
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:54,260
just go out so we have sessions usually

1083
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:57,770
pre-established if they're not it's very

1084
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:59,480
quick to establish them because we don't

1085
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:02,859
have to actually go off box to get the

1086
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:06,020
information we found other issues that

1087
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:09,348
made the controller based model really

1088
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:12,259
nice for us we run control connections

1089
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:15,859
over typically provisioned quote/unquote

1090
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:18,799
secure networks customers certain of our

1091
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:21,319
customers insist upon this data may go

1092
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:24,819
out over the public internet or a public

1093
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:30,680
network but control goes over the

1094
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:33,619
provision of networks and so I'll go

1095
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,000
really high-level into this key exchange

1096
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:36,980
thing I don't want to go into a lot of

1097
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,589
the details of it here because I think

1098
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,930
that's a task for later if we decide to

1099
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:43,880
move forward with any of this but the

1100
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:48,049
concept is actually really pretty simple

1101
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,309
we send it's a different exchange but

1102
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:52,400
it's done through a centralized

1103
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:54,799
controller so an individual node will

1104
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,329
create a diffie-hellman pair send the

1105
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,520
public value up to the controller

1106
00:59:56,329 --> 01:00:01,040
controller aggregates all the public

1107
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,020
values from the different nodes and it

1108
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,150
sends out updates on regular on a

1109
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,640
regular basis now everybody knows

1110
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:09,799
everybody else's public number you can

1111
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,750
create a different pair you know there's

1112
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:14,210
a little bit more to it there are nonces

1113
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,440
and we try to do some good hygiene and

1114
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:19,549
some other stuff but at a high level

1115
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,920
it's just a simple diffie-hellman some

1116
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:24,020
some key misconceptions people have

1117
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,520
thought this was long term static

1118
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:30,440
diffie-hellman it is not we rekey in the

1119
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,980
lab when we're trying to thrash on the

1120
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,940
stuff we rekey every 15 minutes

1121
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:38,270
typically that's not how often you're

1122
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:41,270
going to rekey in the real world but it

1123
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:45,200
does thrash the stuff let me tell you we

1124
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:46,640
but but things do rekey and honestly the

1125
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,290
part of this protocol that makes it more

1126
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,598
interesting than just hey we're

1127
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:53,630
exchanging diffing Hellman pairs is the

1128
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:55,069
synchronization over the rekey so if you

1129
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:57,739
imagine a network with ten

1130
01:00:55,069 --> 01:01:00,739
thousand nodes you need to keep that all

1131
01:00:57,739 --> 01:01:02,930
synchronized when one of them decides to

1132
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:04,789
rekey he's going to send information to

1133
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,558
a controller it's going to get to the

1134
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:10,849
different nodes at different times and

1135
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,440
yet we can't drop packets it's pretty

1136
01:01:10,849 --> 01:01:14,690
complicated if you think about that one

1137
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,390
node rekeying when you think about all

1138
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:19,670
10,000 nodes randomly rekeying at their

1139
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:23,779
you know at their offset of the key

1140
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:25,699
interval it gets pretty hairy if you if

1141
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:28,849
you read the draft it goes into a lot of

1142
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:31,930
detail of a slide in a moment talks

1143
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:31,930
about how that's synchronized

1144
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,829
resynchronization yeah as stated the

1145
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:47,660
route reflector or in our case you know

1146
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:50,479
in st LAN it's not a route reflector but

1147
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,249
it's the same device it optimizes that

1148
01:01:50,479 --> 01:01:55,609
distribution it waits for keys to come

1149
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:57,578
in knows when to send them out I refer

1150
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:59,869
to this mechanism as kind of a lazy

1151
01:01:57,579 --> 01:02:02,449
synchronization lazy sounds like a

1152
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:05,630
negative term but the key point of it is

1153
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:07,940
there are no hard timing consideration I

1154
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,920
don't have to get that key to another

1155
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:13,039
peer at a specific time because I know

1156
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,130
I'm not going to and the protocol is

1157
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:19,420
robust for letting them trickle in on

1158
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:19,420
different schedules to different peers

1159
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:30,739
all over the example so before going

1160
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:35,509
over the example let me put the example

1161
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:38,089
in perspective that imagine a reflector

1162
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:42,380
and they have a bunch of edge devices

1163
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:48,288
and the edge devices are connected to

1164
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:50,329
the rot reflector via they have BGP says

1165
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:52,640
each edge device has a bgp session to

1166
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:54,890
the ross reflector that goes over a

1167
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,259
secure channel of this secure channel

1168
01:02:54,890 --> 01:03:00,709
can be TLS can be IPSec itself or

1169
01:02:57,259 --> 01:03:02,449
whatever so the assumption is bgp

1170
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:04,690
signaling goes over secure channel and

1171
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:11,109
then we use the bgp

1172
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:14,980
to set up these IP sa so in here I give

1173
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:18,880
an example a little bit I wanted to just

1174
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:21,670
you know for the illustration that

1175
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,430
although I came up with a peers okay

1176
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:28,420
that can be hundred peers and each peer

1177
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:30,730
can have a hundred Tenon's and you're

1178
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:34,059
trying to set up the IP sake on a tenant

1179
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:41,799
basis so you end up with again the full

1180
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:45,819
mesh of ten thousand so let me let me

1181
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:50,038
cover two more slides and then we are

1182
01:03:45,819 --> 01:03:53,380
open to the and one more after this so

1183
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:59,230
the reason I put these number they're a

1184
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:02,760
little bit you know to for work your

1185
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:05,470
thoughts and also to make the

1186
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:11,140
differentiation a little bit you know

1187
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:15,939
clear so if we talk about the let's say

1188
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:20,078
ten K peers and as I said these 10 K

1189
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:22,900
peers can be just not another example

1190
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,900
with the hundred with a hundred edge

1191
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:29,920
devices with each with 110 and in it and

1192
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:36,190
we want to set up IPSec tunnels among

1193
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:40,900
them basically six IP SEC messages IQ

1194
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:42,369
messages pair session and we got ten ten

1195
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:46,960
thousand a square which is six hundred

1196
01:04:42,369 --> 01:04:49,480
million with rot reflector basically

1197
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:53,079
every year sends one message to the Ross

1198
01:04:49,480 --> 01:05:00,819
reflector and rod reflector aggregates

1199
01:04:53,079 --> 01:05:04,059
them and it sends it on we can do it on

1200
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:07,119
an interval basis to send it to push it

1201
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:08,829
to everybody else so depending on where

1202
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,890
you set the interval the aggregation

1203
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:14,680
interval if the Ricci interval is 60

1204
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:19,009
minutes and aggregation interval is five

1205
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:25,040
minutes then you have you know

1206
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:29,750
you roughly you have about 100 K or 200

1207
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:32,529
K actually so so we are talking you know

1208
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:37,910
this kind of the order of the magnitude

1209
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:41,090
differences between the two and the

1210
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:46,220
point in here is we can use the

1211
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:48,530
reflector both to save messages on the

1212
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:54,020
ingre from the ingress PE instead of

1213
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:57,400
being 10,000 messages sent one message

1214
01:05:54,020 --> 01:06:01,790
to the rot reflector at and use the

1215
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:06,290
router afflict or mechanism to basically

1216
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:09,009
to do aggregation and packing and send a

1217
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:11,480
lot fewer messages to the egress piece

1218
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:15,970
so after this there is only one more

1219
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:18,859
slide and your open for questions okay

1220
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:22,430
so I'm really not going to go into this

1221
01:06:18,859 --> 01:06:24,560
slide much this is from the draft this

1222
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:26,690
was just a little bit of background

1223
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:29,600
information shows the synchronization

1224
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:31,490
and how it stepped through it's it's

1225
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:34,279
probably completely illegible up there

1226
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:36,259
on the screen and we'll kind of leave it

1227
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:40,040
at that last closing thought all we're

1228
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:43,010
going to say is if you've read the draft

1229
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:46,640
or heard about it it was named with a

1230
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:50,720
name fairly similar to another protocol

1231
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:53,240
common in the security area that seems

1232
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,790
to be a linchpin or our touchstone and

1233
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,100
it is getting renamed I spoke to the guy

1234
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:01,609
this morning who originally named Ike

1235
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:05,109
Ike he kept saying I stand by my report

1236
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:21,500
oh no wait that was Mueller sorry um

1237
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:23,810
anyways he said it was okay followed us

1238
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:27,070
from the IPSec working group I'm to just

1239
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:27,070
go back one two slides

1240
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,180
yeah this one alright so there's six

1241
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,860
messages it's not correct that's for Ike

1242
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,319
v1 you will never use that you'll use

1243
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:38,390
Ike v2 so it means that it's at most two

1244
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,520
messages and if you already set up an I

1245
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:42,770
guess eight beforehand so you only need

1246
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,980
to create a child a safe for the traffic

1247
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:51,520
selector part then it's only one message

1248
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:51,520
to set up the okay in each direction yes

1249
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:03,920
yes if you don't phase one and phase two

1250
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:07,450
that still only sending two messages and

1251
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:17,420
receiving two messages for messages okay

1252
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:20,590
so now we're at 400 million drops very

1253
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:25,130
well-written all right thank you

1254
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:27,260
you use route reflectors yes in BGP

1255
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:29,240
there is a notion where forwarding is

1256
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:32,960
preserved in some cases but the TRO

1257
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:35,090
plane goes down what happens when the

1258
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,430
control plane goes down I think the

1259
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:39,890
draft can help clarify few things as if

1260
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:42,770
are you gonna preserve the IDS or that

1261
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:45,560
keen parameters and if so how long so

1262
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:47,120
that's first comment you name L hello if

1263
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,540
you write when the second of valid

1264
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:54,649
points the second thing is you know we

1265
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:57,430
go beyond a s so what happens when the

1266
01:08:54,649 --> 01:09:00,290
King parameters are leaked beyond s

1267
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:02,630
maybe draft should where he explicitly

1268
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:06,560
hand explained that while you have route

1269
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:08,779
reflectors your edge spoke nodes can

1270
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,970
leak this information out and you can

1271
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:12,710
ask security guys out here what are the

1272
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:15,650
security implicant implications of

1273
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:17,359
leaking it out a clarifying question to

1274
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:19,819
yours care if you'd stay at the mic

1275
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:23,569
that's for the inter is basically no I'm

1276
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:25,580
saying it could get leaked out anywhere

1277
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:28,189
within your domain and so the draft

1278
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:31,550
should minimally say how do you control

1279
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:33,620
that and then use policies to explicitly

1280
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:35,270
configure it if you need to leak it out

1281
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:38,890
what is information

1282
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:43,730
kayuu they're getting sand with

1283
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:47,240
associated rat targets artis yeah and so

1284
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:49,160
based on the weather based on the RT you

1285
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,109
can control the distribution within your

1286
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:53,500
remember they were routes this is your

1287
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:56,360
security information a little different

1288
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,860
right so you need a text they're totally

1289
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,910
tightening up all right

1290
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:06,559
clarifying question on yours are you are

1291
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:09,920
you assuming in your discussion the

1292
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:12,730
route origin and filtering or bgp sick

1293
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:15,800
or are you asking the gentleman to

1294
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:18,349
provide elucidation on that as well as

1295
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,540
what happens when it leaks I'm actually

1296
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:23,060
asking him very indirectly and politely

1297
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:25,250
to add communities to not leak it out by

1298
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:27,350
default across the a s and then strip

1299
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:30,550
those communities at the policies are

1300
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:39,620
needed to explicitly lick it out some

1301
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:42,050
good proposal thank you I have a

1302
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:44,240
clarifying question Anna did you

1303
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:47,750
introduce yourself I'm sorry I'm Ben

1304
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:49,550
Caidic security area director so I have

1305
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:51,230
a clarifying question which is related

1306
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:52,970
to the same confusion that we were

1307
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,240
having in Sec this patch but I'll try it

1308
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,740
again

1309
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,940
hopefully I'll word it better at this

1310
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:00,380
time okay so I understand correctly you

1311
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,790
know we've got the you know ten ten

1312
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:04,130
thousand peers and then we're gonna say

1313
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:05,480
your single message from each of them up

1314
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,570
to the controller and a single message

1315
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:10,040
from the controller down to each of them

1316
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:13,070
but that single message down from the

1317
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,110
controller to each node or pure is

1318
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:17,420
supposed to include the nonce and the

1319
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:18,980
public key from all 10,000 nodes right

1320
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:21,230
and you how bigger there's not some

1321
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,870
other keys I've got 10,000 of them

1322
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:27,740
you're this single message might end up

1323
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:33,550
being you know megabytes and am i

1324
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:42,349
misunderstanding something here no so it

1325
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:43,970
basically based on the interval that the

1326
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:48,030
aggregation interval that you have let's

1327
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:52,110
say you sent in K okay that 10 K if

1328
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:54,330
the nonsan public key exceeds the single

1329
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:57,660
message length then you're going to be

1330
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:59,670
sending multiple messages but the key in

1331
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:04,130
here is you can do a lot of aggregation

1332
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:07,440
here I mean we're increasing the

1333
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:13,440
decipher 64k sure yeah I definitely

1334
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:15,750
believe there's maybe that can be

1335
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:19,139
factored in and instead of 100 K becomes

1336
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:21,540
500 K or 600 K but again this is not

1337
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:27,090
absolute I just wanted to give a feel

1338
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:29,250
because we had similar concerns or

1339
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:33,120
questions were ranged during the sex

1340
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:36,660
dispatch and I just wanted to that's why

1341
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,309
I put this example in there just to hide

1342
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,030
here the feeling and rising that there's

1343
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:43,080
no no you're not

1344
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:47,730
yeah yeah so if I can jump the line if

1345
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:49,260
if I understand you right really the

1346
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,480
gist of this isn't to get down into the

1347
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,730
weeds of the exact number exactly you're

1348
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,769
saying that you know without without a

1349
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,580
controller in the middle its scales like

1350
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,020
N squared

1351
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:01,260
no the control in the middle at skills

1352
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:04,320
then exactly that that's the gist of it

1353
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:08,160
what the there was in securities fresh

1354
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,559
there were a lot of confusion around

1355
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:14,450
these any school reverses n and that's

1356
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,120
what I wanted to clarify via the example

1357
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:19,559
then did you get your question answered

1358
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,180
yeah I think so I mean I don't know if I

1359
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,780
would say his skills exactly as I'm but

1360
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:27,930
it's somewhere between a and square okay

1361
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:30,690
okay okay thank you defend from a range

1362
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:32,070
one general comment people are always

1363
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:34,530
talking this presentation about

1364
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:36,509
controller controller is supposing to

1365
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:40,410
have a kind of intelligence but how

1366
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:41,820
deflectors maybe the most stupid BGP

1367
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,769
speaker in the network so there is no

1368
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,509
intelligence so I just want other

1369
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:47,880
confirmation that you are not breaking

1370
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:50,220
anything in the BGP machinery and what

1371
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,900
you are what you want is just

1372
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:55,110
propagation yeah that's right you

1373
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:57,179
control yeah that's why we are that's

1374
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:59,070
very good point and that's why right

1375
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:01,499
from the beginning I said we got these

1376
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:04,710
four components we have and we have

1377
01:14:01,499 --> 01:14:06,210
ztp server and we have the four

1378
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,999
visioning server and then we have the

1379
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:10,920
signalling and the all these are part of

1380
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:12,869
the big controller okay well you call it

1381
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,880
as a controller but the signaling part

1382
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:17,969
is what we are talking about our are

1383
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,249
with respect to what we are familiar ok

1384
01:14:17,969 --> 01:14:22,530
so whatever the how to affect or design

1385
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:24,210
that I am using clusters or your article

1386
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:27,119
how effective it does not break anything

1387
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:30,059
in your IP signal yes okay actually it

1388
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:33,570
helps okay okay and exactly the same

1389
01:14:30,059 --> 01:14:36,780
command ask you about what happens when

1390
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:39,389
the control plane is failing so do we

1391
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:42,659
need to implement LLG on what are the

1392
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:46,229
side effects basically in a short answer

1393
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:49,499
is if that happens and the control

1394
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:51,809
planning fails or isolated then the

1395
01:14:49,499 --> 01:14:53,909
rekeying aspects is gonna be you know

1396
01:14:51,809 --> 01:15:01,979
effect that you won't be able to rekey

1397
01:14:53,909 --> 01:15:03,598
at the interval that you want I was

1398
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:06,690
still only on this document are we

1399
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:11,130
taking things in general anything yeah

1400
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:13,138
yeah I think that and in fact I think we

1401
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:15,869
should invite the the other authors to

1402
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:17,820
you know come back up to if we want to

1403
01:15:15,869 --> 01:15:20,039
open the floor more you know broader

1404
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:22,469
discussion so which I think we do some

1405
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:26,190
of my cases like like will apply to the

1406
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:34,320
multiple solutions please square into

1407
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:35,999
the discussion okay okay so so the first

1408
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:42,780
thing is so just a Linda you want to

1409
01:15:35,999 --> 01:15:46,650
also come in my first question is do we

1410
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:48,420
have many more routes than notes or how

1411
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:50,940
is this how is this well that's a good

1412
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:54,030
question okay because depending on that

1413
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:57,268
right I'm like if you have many routes

1414
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:58,949
and fewer nodes or you could do an IPSec

1415
01:15:57,269 --> 01:16:00,570
transport mode connection to the node

1416
01:15:58,949 --> 01:16:02,460
and then run to your ear or something

1417
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,759
and then send oldy so you don't have to

1418
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,960
have one

1419
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,909
IPSec as a per wrap right right which

1420
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,010
might save you a little bit of MTU

1421
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:12,780
spaces all apps and it would save you a

1422
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:14,699
lot of negotiation if a new packet comes

1423
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,240
in for a new route you can just route it

1424
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,950
you don't need to

1425
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,660
set up anything new at that point so

1426
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:22,950
very good that's a good question and

1427
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:26,130
that has been I've described that in the

1428
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:29,340
some details in my in my draft secure

1429
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:32,550
VPN saying that we have a different

1430
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:37,860
level of hierarchy okay you can have in

1431
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:40,680
some scenarios you just have a secure

1432
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:43,230
tunnel between two peers okay at the PE

1433
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:49,020
level I call it I got the parks level

1434
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:51,480
okay and however for some tenants within

1435
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:54,110
that box the tenant those are special

1436
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:56,879
tenants and they want to have their own

1437
01:16:54,110 --> 01:17:03,000
IPSec tunnels okay because they don't

1438
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:04,380
trust the general one and then and you

1439
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,500
can go to the next level of the

1440
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:11,130
hierarchy that within that tenant you

1441
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:13,350
can have a host you know a sleepy host

1442
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:16,230
within that tenant that is a special and

1443
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:18,660
wants to have his own so it is this you

1444
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:24,120
don't have to have it for every route

1445
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:25,320
okay but he gave me flexible I

1446
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,330
understand so now you gave me an

1447
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,490
additional problem because because with

1448
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:31,680
IPSec you usually have one I guess a and

1449
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:34,889
you can have like thousands of child

1450
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,510
essays to from traffic but they're still

1451
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:38,340
under one domain so now you might accept

1452
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:39,720
a set of multiple I guess A's between

1453
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,640
these parties if you think that they're

1454
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:48,150
in a different administrative domain

1455
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:49,890
based on which tenant they are sorry so

1456
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:51,480
you're like okay so so in your case you

1457
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:57,180
don't have an IKE essay because you you

1458
01:17:51,480 --> 01:18:00,349
because we're not doing Ike solution yes

1459
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:03,060
they did and I wanted to take a pause

1460
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:06,750
did you June

1461
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:09,840
are you able to speak yes

1462
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:12,330
okay so Paul you can also address the

1463
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:16,110
same question to June June did you get

1464
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:17,700
the question that Paul was asking yes so

1465
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:19,860
so is my draft

1466
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:22,470
I really don't change anything on the

1467
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,990
IPSec side because we continue to use my

1468
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:26,910
tour continues like v2 as way and signal

1469
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:28,510
protocol for that piece AK Tonto the

1470
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:31,510
only thing I do with babies

1471
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:34,540
to signaled IPSec config so whatever we

1472
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:36,460
do today with IPSec stay the same so I

1473
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,950
understand that part but the part is

1474
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:42,030
more about re are you maybe not better

1475
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:45,720
off using an IPSec transport mode tunnel

1476
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:48,759
with a Giri encapsulation instead of

1477
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:51,910
setting up thousands of IPSec assets

1478
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,710
yeah that for some use case that work

1479
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:56,680
which means that if you want to for

1480
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:58,600
example put all your traffic into a

1481
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:02,260
peacenik somehow yeah you could do that

1482
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:04,750
but in some other case they want select

1483
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:06,190
Li selectively to increase chat for

1484
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:09,340
certain traffic they want to use a busy

1485
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:12,330
person do not want unity SEC then you

1486
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:14,920
have to go to different different

1487
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:16,870
destination for the different IPSec

1488
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:20,800
tunnel in that case you might need

1489
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:22,240
multiple IP sector knows ok so so if

1490
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,740
that would be an option and you would

1491
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,050
have some way of having to signal this

1492
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:29,139
yeah

1493
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:31,690
ok so so I'll go to my next question

1494
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:35,830
that applies to all of the all of the

1495
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:38,679
proposals so is IPSec optional or

1496
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:41,320
mandatory or either like like do you

1497
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:49,750
block sending the packets or do you do

1498
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:53,009
you actually studying up the I setting

1499
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:56,530
up this secure tunnel is depends on the

1500
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:59,560
traffic some tenant traffic wants to go

1501
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:03,070
over the secure and some they don't and

1502
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:05,950
that gets determined by the policy and

1503
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:09,099
some and also there are cases that I

1504
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:11,190
think in Linda's use cases you had a

1505
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:15,190
case of the public versus private

1506
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:18,839
network and for the public network for

1507
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:23,410
the private network often you don't use

1508
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:24,310
secure tunnel right so indicates where

1509
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:26,260
it is mandatory

1510
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:29,200
yes any question becomes what do you do

1511
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:31,840
when things fail like with the ike fails

1512
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,940
to establish or or if your so that

1513
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,320
depends on the policy that depends on

1514
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:39,379
the policy the

1515
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,599
a policy might say okay I don't trust

1516
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:43,340
internet don't send anything the other

1517
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:50,330
policy says oh you know what I have

1518
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:53,900
these private tunnel and use that for

1519
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:56,300
instance if IPSec is fully optional you

1520
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:58,700
can load the policy into the kernel but

1521
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,900
you can't do on-demand triggering of it

1522
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:01,700
because the on demand trigger would

1523
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,710
actually then hold the packet because it

1524
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,330
would assume it's mandated and cannot

1525
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:06,680
leak it back at the nuclear for instance

1526
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:11,120
all right so I just want to make sure

1527
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:13,010
that people realize that next item I

1528
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,480
have is so that's that's a good point I

1529
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:17,990
mean this should be captured in the

1530
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:20,209
solution draft right so the next item is

1531
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:22,219
empty you so as soon as you start adding

1532
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:25,100
IPSec of course there is just the

1533
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:27,590
reduced MTU of the data yeah I'm not

1534
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:29,180
sure if I didn't really see any of the

1535
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:31,850
proposals talk about this or how does

1536
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:34,160
affect the original data or that they

1537
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:36,380
think is not a problem but I think that

1538
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:40,849
needs to be given more thought

1539
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:42,530
absolutely so I like to ask these are

1540
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:49,640
good points you're raising can you

1541
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:51,200
please send the email so the next item I

1542
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,160
want to point out is that there there's

1543
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:57,230
the issue of the RTT so if you if you

1544
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,840
set up an I guess a already we call it a

1545
01:21:57,230 --> 01:22:01,820
childless essay where you just set up do

1546
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,980
you do that the two round-trips to

1547
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:05,269
authenticate I guess a so that is not

1548
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:12,169
question for us all right

1549
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:15,500
in general then you then you can later

1550
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:18,740
on on demand within one round-trip get

1551
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:20,990
get in child to say and so that saves

1552
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:23,450
you from doing a two round-trip at that

1553
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:25,580
point so that saves you one round-trip

1554
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:27,349
but it means that you have to set up

1555
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:29,300
these I guess A's in advance so it's

1556
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:33,770
again it's a trade-off you might want to

1557
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:36,140
think about in your desire the next just

1558
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:40,520
a quick point instead this refers to the

1559
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:42,740
first option his comments John I'll get

1560
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:47,710
John if you're on the call yeah so I

1561
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:47,710
mean whatever I provide we use that

1562
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:53,230
we don't really change what act we do

1563
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,580
does but but again you you might need to

1564
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:57,200
you you will need to provision that

1565
01:22:55,580 --> 01:23:00,290
whether or not all parties will do that

1566
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:03,290
or not yeah I mean the config part of

1567
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:06,410
that it could be 2nd of June this may be

1568
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:09,980
good for you to realize that it might be

1569
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:15,110
good to have usage or other details

1570
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:18,530
whether that goes to IDR or that might

1571
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:22,070
be separated in a separate draft and and

1572
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:25,190
put out he's not necessarily specifying

1573
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:27,380
bgp tli you've ease but operational

1574
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:31,879
stuff that usually goes to best so that

1575
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:34,010
might be useful for you okay thanks so

1576
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,730
next I'm going to cover is multicast

1577
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:40,750
traffic so currently IP 2 is in the

1578
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:44,509
process of supporting multicast

1579
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:46,880
negotiation and coupe essays but it's

1580
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:49,070
not there yet v1 used to support it or

1581
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:53,630
actually as I grew unseal support its

1582
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:55,429
but nobody should use it in IP 2 we are

1583
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:58,100
working on it's been a slow process so

1584
01:23:55,430 --> 01:24:00,590
it would actually be a welcome thing if

1585
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:02,240
we have some consumers of this go push

1586
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:05,960
the people that are doing this work and

1587
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:09,349
like for Ike v2 to put some momentum

1588
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:11,420
behind this and get this done and also

1589
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:13,790
want to mention there's there's a

1590
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:16,820
session resumption and that you can also

1591
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:19,490
use to prevent doing it an expensive

1592
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:21,889
diffie-hellman fusion so so maybe not

1593
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:24,679
for you guys but for the other solutions

1594
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:28,580
if you can instead of delete the session

1595
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:31,550
you can get a session ticket resumption

1596
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:34,519
ticket then you can later on much more

1597
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:38,270
quickly with less CPU power re-establish

1598
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:42,620
a new I and our IPSec I say yes yes

1599
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:45,050
agree and let me just go to my last bits

1600
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,550
of the part that I already sent to the

1601
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:50,840
mailing list as some photos already

1602
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:53,170
answered in the in the first

1603
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,170
presentation

1604
01:24:54,550 --> 01:25:00,500
you have anything so yeah just for the

1605
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:05,780
first rotation the examples used or like

1606
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:13,820
AES CBC with 384 please use some more

1607
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:16,849
modern things like ASTM let's see I

1608
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:21,259
recovered that there's the there's not

1609
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:22,730
an issue if if a browser reboot so if we

1610
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:25,550
have an IPSec tunnel and one of these

1611
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:28,490
endpoints fails I'm not sure what the

1612
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:29,750
mechanisms are where it's within IPSec

1613
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:33,200
that something needs to happen or

1614
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:35,330
whether there's a overlaying bgp

1615
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,700
security protocol that will take that

1616
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:43,100
note out of commission and do something

1617
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:48,139
else so one of the edge devices fail so

1618
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:50,450
if that edge device fails the routes to

1619
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:53,510
that route reflector withdraws the route

1620
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:56,660
that failed device and all the other

1621
01:25:53,510 --> 01:26:00,830
edge devices can tear down there

1622
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:03,769
IPSec tunnel to that okay so so so

1623
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:06,500
basically saying an IPSec failure on on

1624
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:07,280
on on a node no I thought you said no

1625
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,290
failure

1626
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,509
I thought you said node failure you're

1627
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:14,260
talking about the IPSec failure yes sir

1628
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:17,750
and talked about would just mean that

1629
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,970
something else takes that that that

1630
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,680
IPSec Gateway out of its misery and and

1631
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:29,150
and everything else gets rerouted around

1632
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:30,950
that innocent IPSec keep alive is there

1633
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:33,950
but that's a really slow mechanism and I

1634
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:36,440
don't think you want to use that and let

1635
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:39,050
me dad exactly at this warning there is

1636
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:42,530
a thing called that peer detection or

1637
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:45,500
liveness and right please be aware that

1638
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:47,780
the RFC said you should not use these

1639
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,610
probes for like more than once a minute

1640
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:51,800
all right some people like to send them

1641
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:53,450
multiple times per second and that you

1642
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:56,300
get really strange things if you try to

1643
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:58,610
do this including shooting yourself

1644
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:02,030
because your probes actually starting to

1645
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:04,519
fail so IPSec tunnel is one of the

1646
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:06,980
tunnel kind we got the MPLS tunnel we

1647
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,790
excellent tunnel Geneva tunnel and all

1648
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:11,839
that

1649
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:14,570
the question I would expand it to to

1650
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,550
more general detection of the tunnel

1651
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:18,710
failure and IPSec would be one of it

1652
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:20,510
right now we just assume that IPSec is a

1653
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:22,330
service on a failing note and that note

1654
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:24,380
will just get out of rotation so that

1655
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:26,570
night beside point of view you don't

1656
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:30,800
need to worry about that okay okay

1657
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:33,889
and I think it is it is worth

1658
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:37,640
considering whether notes online might

1659
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:38,810
be useful in your graph okay Tara I'm

1660
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,090
gonna ask a favor

1661
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:43,400
could I ask you to let them next two

1662
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:45,740
guys who have signed up as security

1663
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:48,559
folks to go first in questioning and

1664
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,900
we'll take the rest of the folks as I

1665
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,720
can in time in other words step behind

1666
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:58,370
Ben and then I will be glad that'll be

1667
01:27:53,720 --> 01:28:13,670
your turn thank you okay you're a little

1668
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:17,930
bit farther I can you know joke with him

1669
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:20,090
because he is a good friend of mine so

1670
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:33,260
for this boss can you go to this light

1671
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:36,050
with the comparison yes scalability no

1672
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:39,860
no on that presentation is called

1673
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:42,850
Billick examples that enormous number of

1674
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:42,849
messages and so on

1675
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:54,950
oh yes yes first of all yes there are

1676
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:57,860
some mistakes on the number of messages

1677
01:28:54,950 --> 01:29:01,179
as polarity said but anyway I think that

1678
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:05,660
this comparison is not completely fair

1679
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:07,400
because why not not sure not not that I

1680
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:11,809
said that you compare the orange and

1681
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:16,730
apples but it is you go to a bit extreme

1682
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:17,990
because in my case it's very case so I

1683
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,759
just wanted to make sure you don't

1684
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:21,050
mistake the apple with the orange that's

1685
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,670
why that strong

1686
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:29,540
but but you just go to extreme and

1687
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:32,690
usually say in I case usually I say I

1688
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:35,990
created on demand and it is very rare

1689
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:41,389
that all ten thousands of people of

1690
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:44,630
beers will simultaneously create to nose

1691
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:48,140
with every every every p8 yes so it's

1692
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:51,950
it's some it's extreme well and then

1693
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:54,920
also just like a you have a power outage

1694
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:56,599
and then into the city and takes out the

1695
01:29:54,920 --> 01:30:01,100
whole north and that the robber comes up

1696
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:02,930
and it will be within the within a

1697
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:07,400
window but it's not going to happen

1698
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:13,070
anyway 24 hours gone to the second

1699
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:13,879
comment the other it's unfair for

1700
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:17,389
another reason

1701
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:20,390
okay these solution I mean our like

1702
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:21,920
solution and this kind of security

1703
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:25,850
control solution have it's like a

1704
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:29,690
different security properties because in

1705
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:34,370
this case every node has a single public

1706
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:37,669
well you so for example if you break

1707
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:40,250
this public wheeling this public key

1708
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:42,890
with some I can count quantum computer

1709
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:47,300
or something else it will compromise all

1710
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:53,350
the essays it has with every bill and in

1711
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:57,980
IPS in like the classical solution each

1712
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:59,990
kernel is using ephemeral difficult so

1713
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:04,509
if somebody breaks it it will only

1714
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:04,510
compromise a single kernel and other

1715
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:11,690
9999 donors will become say so it is

1716
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:16,610
slightly difficult with different

1717
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:18,160
security purposes person yes so so it is

1718
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:20,839
true it is a shared diffie-hellman

1719
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,690
across all the nodes though we do have

1720
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:26,870
Ricky along you say for messages for

1721
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:28,639
this reason but you get security so that

1722
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:30,110
you lose some something they would very

1723
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:33,440
appropriately go in the security

1724
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:35,070
consideration section right yeah I don't

1725
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,759
want you to think it's not then

1726
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:39,870
thought of and not addressed but it is a

1727
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:46,920
it is a limitation and there's

1728
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:48,599
countermeasures Thank You doc so I tried

1729
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,610
to also be thinking you're in addition

1730
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,140
to the the specific mechanisms proposed

1731
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:53,969
to try and come up with some general

1732
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:59,730
considerations that might apply it to

1733
01:31:53,970 --> 01:32:02,190
all of them and so like in general you

1734
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:04,139
need to consider if you're going to get

1735
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:06,750
your configuration through bgp or

1736
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:07,830
through your controller you need to be

1737
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:09,930
thinking about you know how much do you

1738
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:11,250
trust that configuration what other

1739
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:13,950
information are you getting through the

1740
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:15,840
same mechanism and you know if that

1741
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:19,139
other information was wrong or corrupted

1742
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:21,050
or you know an attacker control that how

1743
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,160
would you break for that and you know

1744
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:25,200
maybe if you're gonna be horribly broken

1745
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:31,430
already then you don't necessarily care

1746
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:33,690
if your configuration is also broken and

1747
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:37,410
you also always want to make sure to

1748
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:39,570
think about you know what properties do

1749
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:41,700
I want to get from IPSec like why am i

1750
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:43,889
doing this at all do I need to protect

1751
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:46,830
the confidentiality confidentiality of

1752
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:48,330
my traffic from some other parties and

1753
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:50,700
there so you know which other parties do

1754
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:52,769
I need to authenticate appear you know

1755
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,540
and you need to do sort of like a full

1756
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:56,970
system analysis to make sure that you're

1757
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:59,940
actually getting that property for

1758
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:02,630
example if you have a system where you

1759
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:06,210
do want to authenticate to peer and

1760
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:06,840
instead of relying on a central asia'

1761
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:08,840
parinama

1762
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,590
unlike some sort of certificate to

1763
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:12,420
authenticate you know the key that

1764
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:14,100
you're gonna use your instead gonna say

1765
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,780
well I got this key from a trusted

1766
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,930
central controller and I'm just gonna

1767
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:20,670
trust that standard controller to give

1768
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:23,520
me the properly authenticated mapping

1769
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:25,080
between keys and identifiers that might

1770
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,150
change a little bit what your

1771
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:29,010
authentication story is and so you want

1772
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:31,139
to think about that it may not be a

1773
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:34,890
problem but it is something you want to

1774
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:37,860
think about another thing that's sort of

1775
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:40,400
important is if you do want to have the

1776
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:41,969
confidentiality protection it's

1777
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,230
important to remember that it's

1778
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:46,050
confidential you know confidentiality

1779
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:48,990
protection from some entity or some

1780
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:51,840
class of entities and so

1781
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:54,210
if it's possible to end up with the

1782
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,730
wrong configuration whether that's you

1783
01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:58,290
know traffic selectors or or your keys

1784
01:33:56,730 --> 01:34:00,629
or whatnot

1785
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:03,990
it may well be the case that you can end

1786
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:05,610
up with a connection that is using IPSec

1787
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:07,860
and providing you confidential

1788
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:10,019
confidentiality protection from the

1789
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:11,130
wrong people and is in fact connecting

1790
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,590
to the people that you didn't want to

1791
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:16,950
talk to and so you know just because you

1792
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:20,100
have a successful IPSec association and

1793
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:21,510
you know you're encrypting your data you

1794
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:26,520
gotta make sure you're encrypting it to

1795
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:29,310
the right people and I think in terms of

1796
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,570
the when we're adding multiple ways to

1797
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:33,480
distribute configuration information

1798
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:35,309
just a quick note the respective last

1799
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:41,129
point it is it is important because

1800
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:42,810
you're gonna try to make the over try to

1801
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:44,970
make the connectivity over the van as

1802
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:47,190
secure as possible but if you don't take

1803
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:50,760
care of the cross connect between your

1804
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:52,589
end user and the traffic that it is

1805
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,720
unencrypted then all your effort is

1806
01:34:52,590 --> 01:35:01,110
wasting yeah there's all sorts of ways

1807
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:02,790
things I think my my last point is is

1808
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:04,110
just to say that you know if you do have

1809
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:05,910
the multiple mechanisms to get in

1810
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:07,559
configuration as long as everybody

1811
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:10,190
agrees to normal to use the normal type

1812
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:13,380
of human mechanisms that's totally fine

1813
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:15,690
to use the tiebreaking mechanisms for

1814
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:17,070
like if you've got two different things

1815
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:19,320
that are trying to complain the same

1816
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:22,410
route in terms of what configuration to

1817
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:24,059
use as long as everybody knows what the

1818
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:27,540
tiebreak mechanism I think that's that's

1819
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:29,970
generally fine and sorry I had one more

1820
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:33,090
point there's a lot of these aspects

1821
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:36,900
that will be easily controlled using

1822
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:38,610
sort of local policy to make sure your

1823
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:40,559
your traffic selectors

1824
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:42,480
actually make sense in the broader

1825
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,400
scheme and so you can like do sanity

1826
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,990
checking on some of the configuration

1827
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,120
you get my guess is must serve for the

1828
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:51,170
controller icon the other two did you

1829
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:55,650
say just one more moment about the track

1830
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:57,390
traffic selectors are you addressing

1831
01:35:55,650 --> 01:36:01,139
that generally then to both

1832
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:02,110
presentations or did you have more for

1833
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:06,280
June's freeze

1834
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:08,500
tation and his color selector I think

1835
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:10,509
that was both of the first two

1836
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:14,800
presentations thank you and thank you

1837
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:16,380
for taking and Paul and I didn't catch

1838
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,840
the little gentleman

1839
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:22,030
Valerie's lot of something thank you

1840
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,280
very much for taking the time to think

1841
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:27,699
through that and give us such detailed

1842
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:29,980
feedback I I know this is being recorded

1843
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:32,678
so I will go back and write myself

1844
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:34,750
Watson notes based on it if you would

1845
01:36:32,679 --> 01:36:36,639
send any of it to the may list we'd also

1846
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:39,369
appreciate it yeah I will try to do that

1847
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:42,159
and just really quickly to address a

1848
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:44,769
little bit of the the authentication

1849
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:48,089
issues and you there's certainly a need

1850
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:51,210
for an edge to identify the controller

1851
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:55,270
authoritative Lea and Ann and vice versa

1852
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:57,610
some of that is slightly discussed in in

1853
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:59,409
my draft but it's kind of cursory

1854
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:00,820
there's an assumption that that has

1855
01:36:59,409 --> 01:37:02,860
happened when you look at the

1856
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:05,259
architecture there it it's going back to

1857
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:07,089
starting with ztp and how does something

1858
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,730
connect to the network but I very much

1859
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:12,610
agree it all has to be tied together

1860
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:14,559
that whole authentication chain because

1861
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:17,460
obviously fundamentally nothing matters

1862
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:20,790
if I don't know who I'm talking to

1863
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:23,800
so actually we were also planning to

1864
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:25,600
write our architecture draft that talks

1865
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:28,060
about these different pieces and how

1866
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,949
they're glue together so that to make

1867
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:31,949
sure that the overall picture is clear

1868
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:46,150
are you sure we the last presentation

1869
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:49,239
for the day that was invited on i'm

1870
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:51,339
warren jr you're off now so we just have

1871
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:53,519
two more I do presentations you have

1872
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:55,600
about three or four minutes guys super

1873
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,639
tell us two more points

1874
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,920
sure I'm echoing what Stefan said

1875
01:37:57,639 --> 01:38:01,869
earlier if you're going to do this using

1876
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,949
route reflectors you may want to suggest

1877
01:38:01,869 --> 01:38:07,570
implementers as end operators as to is

1878
01:38:04,949 --> 01:38:09,099
there a lot of message is not that BGP

1879
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:10,599
can't handle but you will see a head of

1880
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,840
line blocking if you will start mixing

1881
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:15,489
up officer fees so probably I don't have

1882
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,620
a good suggestion for you but probably

1883
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:20,019
a separate route reflector or something

1884
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:21,940
that doesn't affect routes at all the

1885
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:24,460
routes second thing is that was a

1886
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:27,429
draftee an idea working group which

1887
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:29,320
actually tracked for labels if the

1888
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:31,120
labels became inactive they had a way to

1889
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:34,509
take the routes out or the next stalks

1890
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:36,640
out because this is an IPSec tunnel and

1891
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:38,860
I think Paul mentioned it's one second

1892
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:40,540
keep alive you are more than welcome to

1893
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:43,330
reduce it to milliseconds it's Paul's

1894
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:47,380
problem not mine but you wanna give some

1895
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:50,260
suggestion in text to the implementers

1896
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:52,630
to say should that tunnel become

1897
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:55,330
inactive what I mean what are the means

1898
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:56,770
to detect that tell is inactive and how

1899
01:38:55,330 --> 01:39:03,210
do you go about doing it up here

1900
01:38:56,770 --> 01:39:06,460
absolutely no no no that's important on

1901
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:09,190
the math actually does not change the

1902
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:11,380
picture a big picture but let's to make

1903
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:13,870
sure people to leave the leave the room

1904
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:16,330
with this big number yes so 600 meaning

1905
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:23,370
that's not I think the right number

1906
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:26,980
should be higher okay yeah I stand I

1907
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:29,349
think am tied it sings square knot and

1908
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:31,900
cubicle I think that's the type of x

1909
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:34,719
squared in Kos square would be a hundred

1910
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:46,330
K right a hydro K 10 K is a hundred

1911
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:48,280
million is 100 million okay different

1912
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:51,070
from orange I wanted to go back to the

1913
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:54,580
pendulum caps and phenotypes that we are

1914
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:56,139
acquiring because I think we have plenty

1915
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:58,360
of different use case so you have a

1916
01:39:56,140 --> 01:40:00,730
simple one which is a IPSec Turner but

1917
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:04,330
but then we can use any kind of overlay

1918
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:06,629
with IPSec transport mode so how do we

1919
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:09,000
do it so today we have some of the

1920
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:12,730
combinations that are defined in our

1921
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:16,960
5566 which may probably disappear so we

1922
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:20,769
need to create something else so then

1923
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:23,620
are we keeping creating a combination of

1924
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:26,680
each overlay + IP SEC transport model

1925
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:28,740
are we using something more flexible so

1926
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:32,100
telling for example that I'm using

1927
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:32,969
vague slang type processor TLV things

1928
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:36,180
that I'm doing

1929
01:40:32,970 --> 01:40:39,600
IPSec transport well the current

1930
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:44,450
thinking that's a valid question and

1931
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:51,300
point the current thinking is the IPSec

1932
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:57,030
attribute the the the theory that gets

1933
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:59,880
carried in the tunneling cap is going to

1934
01:40:57,030 --> 01:41:03,240
specify what kind of the IPSec we have

1935
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:07,290
and then we have this extended community

1936
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:12,179
to to define what kind of the over Libya

1937
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:15,930
is it VX LAN or is it Geneva or whatever

1938
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:18,240
so we've done this kind of thing for the

1939
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:21,180
multicast as well because in multicast

1940
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:26,190
we send pins eternal attribute and the

1941
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:28,710
pins eternal attribute can be team or so

1942
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:30,900
forth so with the team question is what

1943
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:33,240
is inside the pin is it VX an or Geneva

1944
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:36,440
or what so what they want that the trick

1945
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:40,139
that or not the trick what we've done is

1946
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:42,889
we send the IP eternal attribute to say

1947
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:45,330
that this is a trim panel and then the

1948
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:46,980
extended community to say what is the

1949
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:50,760
type of the overlay that gets carried

1950
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:53,040
inside a tunnel but that particular

1951
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:55,290
piece you need to think how you might do

1952
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:57,350
it with attributes you know because

1953
01:41:55,290 --> 01:42:00,980
you're now into tunnel attributes

1954
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:04,380
separate point I needed to as a chair as

1955
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:06,269
if we can close the line because I've

1956
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:08,460
got 20 minutes and 20 minutes for the

1957
01:42:06,270 --> 01:42:11,820
presentation did you have a quick one in

1958
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:14,370
Richmond yeah I just want to finish with

1959
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:16,290
a Linda's draft and we turn around

1960
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:19,200
observation types where you are trying

1961
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:26,940
to define the kind of sd1 typist sd1 is

1962
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:28,620
not really enough affiliation I didn't

1963
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:30,929
get a chance to present them how we

1964
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:34,620
encode the message into the tunneling

1965
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:36,930
cab and if if I get chance next time to

1966
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:39,960
show details you will see that the

1967
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:40,780
tunneling cab we need a different tunnel

1968
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:43,870
type

1969
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:48,150
so for specifically for the overlay long

1970
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:50,280
reach over like so I call it as do I can

1971
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:52,750
okay and that one folks

1972
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:56,380
Stephan and Linda would be good on the

1973
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:58,060
list as well Justin Sarah so the graph

1974
01:42:56,380 --> 01:43:00,910
implicitly suggests that relationship

1975
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:03,969
between endpoints and distribution point

1976
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:12,250
is ibgp other cases where it could be

1977
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:14,489
ebgp for the and if you're connecting if

1978
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:18,850
you're connecting the SS together

1979
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:21,280
because ebgp within the network itself

1980
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:25,510
typically is you know like a it use for

1981
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:30,179
your underlay for the overlay goes I be

1982
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:32,620
GP so the a BGP that I can think of is

1983
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:35,949
for the you know in case of the inter

1984
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:38,110
area stuff or maybe actually there is a

1985
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:39,790
wanna true but if there is probably you

1986
01:43:38,110 --> 01:43:43,599
want to think about route servers and

1987
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:45,250
address the garden oh yeah okay folks

1988
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,960
we're gonna close the line and go from

1989
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:48,790
the next presentation I want to big

1990
01:43:46,960 --> 01:44:03,370
thank you for all the cruise endeavors

1991
01:43:48,790 --> 01:44:04,090
and for the Alex before before you start

1992
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:06,580
I want to ask

1993
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:10,120
Alvaro to come up and say you know two

1994
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:14,980
words about charter if that's okay

1995
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:28,269
Alvaro but only two words please pick

1996
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:29,410
them well do it okay so you guys know

1997
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:32,130
because it's been on the mailing list

1998
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:34,420
that we're looking to recharter ID are

1999
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:36,130
one of the reasons we try to write the

2000
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:38,380
ours because the charter has much of

2001
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:40,090
items in it that have been completed

2002
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:41,830
other items that we're not doing anymore

2003
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:43,980
and it doesn't necessarily reflect

2004
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:45,880
everything that we're doing right now

2005
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:48,549
so no there's been discussion on the

2006
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:51,940
list about what the working group wants

2007
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:53,599
to do talking to the chairs earlier what

2008
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:54,799
we think we want to do

2009
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:57,590
the discussions are gonna happen on

2010
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:00,230
Friday so don't even come and ask any

2011
01:44:57,590 --> 01:45:01,909
questions when we think we want to do is

2012
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:03,829
we want to produce a general charter

2013
01:45:01,909 --> 01:45:06,769
that talks about what the working group

2014
01:45:03,829 --> 01:45:09,230
does in general who are the other work

2015
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:11,389
groups that we coordinate with bears

2016
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:13,848
gross eye drops you know etc all those

2017
01:45:11,389 --> 01:45:15,320
other working groups maybe a little bit

2018
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:18,409
of how that happens

2019
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:20,389
maybe call out some specific things to

2020
01:45:18,409 --> 01:45:22,098
clarify what ID are versus the other

2021
01:45:20,389 --> 01:45:24,500
working groups are responsible for if

2022
01:45:22,099 --> 01:45:27,500
anyone can come up with something that

2023
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:29,449
should not be covered by IDR maybe we

2024
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:31,849
want to put it there but the specific

2025
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:34,250
work items so that we don't run into the

2026
01:45:31,849 --> 01:45:36,050
same charter with half the items

2027
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:38,750
completed in half not and some that

2028
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:41,480
we're not going to do in another two

2029
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:43,489
years and have to reach our again we

2030
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:46,638
want to do is we want to manage all the

2031
01:45:43,489 --> 01:45:48,199
work items through the milestones so

2032
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:51,050
what we hope that we'll do is we'll give

2033
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:52,369
the chairs a lot more manageability the

2034
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:53,840
working group and a lot more flexibility

2035
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:55,790
if there are things that come up there

2036
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:58,030
are more interesting that whatever we've

2037
01:45:55,790 --> 01:46:00,769
been doing in the last six months we can

2038
01:45:58,030 --> 01:46:02,570
change some of the milestone orders or

2039
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:04,820
whatever with the working group of

2040
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:07,750
personal senses and we can move on that

2041
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:09,679
a lot quicker we will hopefully avoid

2042
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:11,599
discussions about well that is not a

2043
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:13,610
charter or that is in the Charter or you

2044
01:46:11,599 --> 01:46:14,900
know etc or things like that again the

2045
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:16,369
other thing wants to avoid is to have to

2046
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:18,440
every couple of years go through the

2047
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:19,820
painful process of recharter in their

2048
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,710
working group but instead we can just

2049
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:23,659
talk in the working group with the input

2050
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:25,989
of the other work groups that are close

2051
01:46:23,659 --> 01:46:28,460
to where they are about what are the

2052
01:46:25,989 --> 01:46:30,019
important things or the higher priority

2053
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:31,159
things everything's important the higher

2054
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:33,619
priority things that we should be

2055
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:36,530
working on at any given time

2056
01:46:33,619 --> 01:46:38,000
so think about that and on Friday I

2057
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:40,550
think we're gonna have a larger

2058
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,929
discussion on those items and hopefully

2059
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:46,750
some text on what the Charter is gonna

2060
01:46:41,929 --> 01:46:46,750
actually say thanks thanks

2061
01:46:54,480 --> 01:47:02,830
folks we will probably run two to three

2062
01:46:57,190 --> 01:47:04,480
minutes over because we've because we've

2063
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:06,730
run wrong I'd like to give each

2064
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:08,740
presenter about 10 minutes just be

2065
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:16,259
warned we'll just let the next presenter

2066
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:18,969
go okay hello I'm Marsha from Cisco

2067
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:22,990
today I'm going to present the updates

2068
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:27,520
to the draft PGP PFT straight mode since

2069
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:33,690
last ITF since last ITF we have a new

2070
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:33,690
Corsa Jeff has joined us from juniper

2071
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:49,240
all right the drafter was presented at

2072
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:53,080
ITF 104 in Prague and since then main

2073
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:56,769
updates to this document our PGP finest

2074
01:47:53,080 --> 01:48:03,370
tape machine weighs the PFD 3d mode we

2075
01:47:56,770 --> 01:48:05,350
also propose the PFD Haute timer both

2076
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:07,330
manageability and security

2077
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:14,710
considerations sections are revised

2078
01:48:07,330 --> 01:48:20,019
those a quick recap of the draft M the

2079
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:22,960
BGP the bgp PFD capable sorry the PGP

2080
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:26,050
PFD Street mode is a solution proposed

2081
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:30,250
the to address the PGP and the PFD

2082
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:35,050
interaction issues the solution defines

2083
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:39,810
bgp PFD capability and enables the PFD

2084
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:43,770
capability negotiation operations are a

2085
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:46,780
bgp speaker which supports capabilities

2086
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:50,050
advertisement and has BFD street mode

2087
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:53,559
enabled must include the BGP PFD

2088
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:57,460
capability with the a speed set in the

2089
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:59,620
BTB capabilities it advertises a BGP

2090
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:03,189
speaker which support Beach PFD

2091
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:07,780
capability and exams the

2092
01:49:03,189 --> 01:49:10,959
and exams the PFD capability received

2093
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:13,929
the from its peer okay if both the local

2094
01:49:10,959 --> 01:49:18,219
and the remote the BGP speakers have a

2095
01:49:13,929 --> 01:49:21,249
PFD Street mode enabled then bgp session

2096
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:24,070
established will be established after

2097
01:49:21,249 --> 01:49:28,300
PFD such a yes up

2098
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:32,280
if either BGP pier has not advertised

2099
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:36,429
the PFDs capability with 3d mode enabled

2100
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:39,039
then the FD session state will not be

2101
01:49:36,429 --> 01:49:42,300
required of order bgp session

2102
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:45,989
establishment ok

2103
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:52,150
please note that this does not preclude

2104
01:49:45,989 --> 01:49:58,749
usage of PFD and after the BGP session

2105
01:49:52,150 --> 01:50:00,969
establishment the new updates BGP final

2106
01:49:58,749 --> 01:50:04,199
state machine with PFD straight amount

2107
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:07,449
if both the local and remote DTES

2108
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:10,959
speakers have BFD street model

2109
01:50:07,449 --> 01:50:13,749
neighborhood the BGP finally the Machine

2110
01:50:10,959 --> 01:50:16,749
does not a transition to establish the

2111
01:50:13,749 --> 01:50:23,039
state from open sent or open confirm

2112
01:50:16,749 --> 01:50:29,260
state until the PFD session is up ok um

2113
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:30,880
in this state no keep life messages are

2114
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:35,889
sent ok

2115
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:37,809
the keepalive timer is not set if PFD

2116
01:50:35,889 --> 01:50:42,269
session does not a transition to up

2117
01:50:37,809 --> 01:50:46,150
state and negotiator hold on timer has

2118
01:50:42,269 --> 01:50:50,380
non zero value then BGP finite state

2119
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:55,239
machine we are closed session of the BGP

2120
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:57,630
whole time expires in a case the

2121
01:50:55,239 --> 01:51:02,468
negotiator hold on time value is zero

2122
01:50:57,630 --> 01:51:06,539
then PFD hold timer with the t4 the

2123
01:51:02,469 --> 01:51:10,349
value of 30 seconds proposed is proposed

2124
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:13,659
so after the PFD hold on time expires

2125
01:51:10,349 --> 01:51:15,840
BGP finest a machine will closed the

2126
01:51:13,659 --> 01:51:15,839
session

2127
01:51:16,429 --> 01:51:23,810
if PFD session is in Adam in downstate

2128
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:28,239
BGP finest animation will proceed

2129
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:32,929
normally without input from PFD okay if

2130
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:39,110
PFD is disabled or deconflict from a BGP

2131
01:51:32,929 --> 01:51:42,949
spear and BGP session is in is held in

2132
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:46,670
the opens send or open come from state

2133
01:51:42,949 --> 01:51:52,309
then BGP will close session and start a

2134
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:54,980
new TCP connection updates to

2135
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:58,940
manageability and security consideration

2136
01:51:54,980 --> 01:52:02,360
a BGP notification messages sub code

2137
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:04,969
indicating PFD hold on time expiration

2138
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:08,210
may be required for network management

2139
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:12,230
and this will be discussed in next the

2140
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:15,429
revision of the document the security

2141
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:19,750
consideration of PFD becomes

2142
01:52:15,429 --> 01:52:24,500
considerations for BGP when it's used

2143
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:28,870
the use of PFD authentication mechanism

2144
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:34,030
defined in the IFC v h0 is recommended

2145
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:34,030
when used to protect the BGP

2146
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:43,269
[Music]

2147
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:43,269
the view comments are real calm and

2148
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:53,870
folks we're running that long then I'm

2149
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:57,650
gonna give her a bit of time time or

2150
01:52:53,870 --> 01:53:00,920
asked us to go to the list and I think

2151
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:03,019
we'll slip in Alexander so I'm sorry to

2152
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:05,960
trim your comments if you will catch her

2153
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:12,920
afterwards Alexander why don't you go

2154
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:15,199
for about I've got enough time to why

2155
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:17,090
don't you give the brief two or three

2156
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:22,580
points you need before grow or do you

2157
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:24,150
need the full ten minutes go

2158
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:28,080
you got it Ben

2159
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:38,730
thank you very much it's ten minutes for

2160
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:40,530
small values of 10 hello everybody my

2161
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:43,980
name is Alexander azimuth I work for

2162
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:51,300
Yandex and this will be very quick

2163
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:53,849
update for BGP rolls draft so the core

2164
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:56,490
of the original design is BGP rolls

2165
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:58,200
BGP rolls is a proposed new

2166
01:53:56,490 --> 01:54:02,340
configuration parameter that is

2167
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:05,720
negotiated in open BGP me in open

2168
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:09,180
messages so there are 5 specified roles

2169
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:12,270
customer provider peer router and route

2170
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:17,130
server client so the draft was already

2171
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:20,250
here for at least 3 years originally it

2172
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:23,340
was a transit attribute to detent to

2173
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:26,430
detect and prevents networks from

2174
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:30,510
leaking after that it was treated in to

2175
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:33,720
to IOT see for prevention yo TC for

2176
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:35,580
detection then it was merged with

2177
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:39,570
another attribute from another draft

2178
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:42,840
then I see a merged and it's changed

2179
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:44,730
they feel slightly because we need

2180
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:47,490
solution faster than reworks

2181
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:51,509
we were thinking previously and that's

2182
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:54,510
why our LP attribute was transformed

2183
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:56,580
into do community and IOT C was nearly

2184
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:59,340
ready for working group last call we had

2185
01:54:56,580 --> 01:55:02,100
implementations it now happens modular

2186
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:04,290
design and I'm going to go through and

2187
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:08,340
explain why it's happening and why it's

2188
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:10,230
happening now so please take a look at

2189
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:12,240
these rules I will spend more time on

2190
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:15,629
this writer than on any other style

2191
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:17,580
because it is important first rule is it

2192
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:20,070
a quote from leak prevention draft it

2193
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:23,010
says if a route is received from

2194
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:25,139
provider route server or peer it must

2195
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:27,810
not be sent to another provider

2196
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:31,980
appearing in other words it must be sent

2197
01:55:27,810 --> 01:55:35,850
only to down streams only to customers

2198
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:37,709
second rule if a route is sent to

2199
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:40,800
customer beer or

2200
01:55:37,709 --> 01:55:45,479
Andres client it also must follow only

2201
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:47,939
down rule so these rules are nearly the

2202
01:55:45,479 --> 01:55:50,610
same but represents the picture from

2203
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:53,840
different sides of BGP session one rule

2204
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:57,929
for receiver and one rule for the sender

2205
01:55:53,840 --> 01:56:03,360
button but in general they are just the

2206
01:55:57,929 --> 01:56:05,670
same so we're getting OTC back we are

2207
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:09,030
getting a transit attribute that's is

2208
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:14,400
capable for both prevent networks from

2209
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:16,438
leaking and detect anomalies so and also

2210
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,329
it is improved ought to see attribute it

2211
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:22,289
has a different design from the original

2212
01:56:18,329 --> 01:56:26,489
one it says that on ingress policy you

2213
01:56:22,289 --> 01:56:29,969
must set this attribute is not set and

2214
01:56:26,489 --> 01:56:33,509
if we are receiving a prefix from route

2215
01:56:29,969 --> 01:56:37,920
server provider appear on the ingress

2216
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:42,329
policy you are saying that if yo TC is

2217
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:47,400
not set you are setting when sending its

2218
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:50,130
to customers and peers so in the picture

2219
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:52,469
the picture of how it's working on the

2220
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:55,709
left side is provider on the right hand

2221
01:56:52,469 --> 01:56:58,559
side is customer no matter who is

2222
01:56:55,709 --> 01:57:04,099
setting out to see the value will be the

2223
01:56:58,559 --> 01:57:06,989
same so we are getting a tool that has

2224
01:57:04,099 --> 01:57:10,530
negotiated its configuration plus we

2225
01:57:06,989 --> 01:57:14,489
also have a double checked configuration

2226
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:17,130
of OTC attribute with this attribute we

2227
01:57:14,489 --> 01:57:19,739
have a very simple rules for a root leak

2228
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:21,300
detection and prevention so I will just

2229
01:57:19,739 --> 01:57:27,539
drop the slide and go through the

2230
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:31,530
example here I Swan is sending prefix to

2231
01:57:27,539 --> 01:57:33,659
eyes to its customer again no matter who

2232
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:39,840
is setting out to see it might be said

2233
01:57:33,659 --> 01:57:43,110
or by is one on egress on IRA's or by is

2234
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:48,689
to on ingress the value will be the same

2235
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:51,239
the value value will be a a s1 and on

2236
01:57:48,689 --> 01:57:54,719
the other side of

2237
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:59,669
our own system - it must be checked that

2238
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:03,119
ultc exists so it if it is checked on

2239
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:06,479
egress where we have leak prevention if

2240
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:11,339
it's it is checked on ingress we have

2241
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:14,219
leak detection so we have rules that are

2242
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:17,159
negotiated on both sides we have marking

2243
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:19,229
that is done on both sides and we we

2244
01:58:17,159 --> 01:58:24,659
have a leak detection that also is done

2245
01:58:19,229 --> 01:58:27,570
on both sides so the interesting

2246
01:58:24,659 --> 01:58:32,549
question is what we should do with route

2247
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:34,590
leaks and it seems that the only policy

2248
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:38,880
that can be applicable for out the

2249
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:41,760
communication you must drop them but in

2250
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:43,199
certain situations you may want to pass

2251
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,510
them by for example just to learn the

2252
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:48,539
signal before applying this mass drop

2253
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:50,189
policy so I will get to this equation in

2254
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:52,800
more detail after the coffee break

2255
01:58:50,189 --> 01:58:56,159
during recession and job will you tell

2256
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:59,639
us when the gold session is it's yes

2257
01:58:56,159 --> 01:59:03,449
next session this room so stay here and

2258
01:58:59,639 --> 01:59:05,699
enjoy the next thank you and the last

2259
01:59:03,449 --> 01:59:09,869
question that is must be highlighted for

2260
01:59:05,699 --> 01:59:13,409
years during discussion related to root

2261
01:59:09,869 --> 01:59:15,119
leak detection question we had an

2262
01:59:13,409 --> 01:59:17,579
argument which one is better

2263
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:20,820
should we go with community or should we

2264
01:59:17,579 --> 01:59:23,518
go with attribute attribute is more

2265
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:27,360
native it's more reliable signal it's

2266
01:59:23,519 --> 01:59:31,439
memory efficient it's not over loud with

2267
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:35,098
different functions but community here

2268
01:59:31,439 --> 01:59:37,530
is easy to deploy we can in selected

2269
01:59:35,099 --> 01:59:39,800
papers so we can deploy it tomorrow in

2270
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:42,539
Yandex we can deploy it tomorrow so

2271
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:45,209
instead of arguing which which one is

2272
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:49,079
better we decided to do both so they

2273
01:59:45,209 --> 01:59:50,909
will be an OTC a proper attribute that

2274
01:59:49,079 --> 01:59:53,188
will be used for lick prevention and

2275
01:59:50,909 --> 01:59:56,400
detection and there will be also a

2276
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:59,280
community that will model OTC behavior

2277
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:01,499
just for same purpose the difference is

2278
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:04,349
that OTC will be available in a couple

2279
02:00:01,499 --> 02:00:05,080
of years communicator can be become

2280
02:00:04,349 --> 02:00:10,960
available

2281
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:13,269
in a month so there's some summary on

2282
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:16,870
the current status so we transformed I

2283
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:20,980
OTC to a transit OTC we have marking on

2284
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:23,320
both sides we have a configuration check

2285
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:26,469
on both sides we have filtering on both

2286
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:29,469
sides rolls can provide automation for

2287
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:33,280
the for solution for bulls community in

2288
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:35,050
attribute so thank you for listening I

2289
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:39,190
don't think we have a lot of time for

2290
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:41,350
Croatians but you can grow yes yes yes

2291
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:43,750
um the other thing is if the it's an

2292
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:47,050
attribute it has you know send it back

2293
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:48,940
the idea for that okay yeah so uh so if

2294
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:50,530
we're changing the attributes that we

2295
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:51,849
and we need to ask for another

2296
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:55,660
allocation am i right

2297
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:57,900
okay good thanks everybody see you

2298
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,900
Friday
