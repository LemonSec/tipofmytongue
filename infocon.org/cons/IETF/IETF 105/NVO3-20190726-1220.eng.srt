so we're gonna give it a couple more

6
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,550
minutes because people are still having

7
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,269
lunch and we're missing some of our

8
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,269
presenters still

9
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,198

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:15,589
okay so welcome to MPI 3 in the last the

12

last slot of this this ITF I'm Matthew

13

issued doing the doing the minutes today

16
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,179
our secretary thank you here is a note

17
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,729
well I'm sure you've seen this many many

18
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:31,698
times this week that's we have to show

19
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,949
it once again basically it says that

20
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:41,599
anything you say here is a contribution

21
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:43,039
to the ITF okay blue sheets are going

22
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,308
around there's one on each side of the

23
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,449
room please sign the blue sheets and if

24
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:48,739
you're the last person at the back of

25
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,299
the room with the blue sheet if you

26
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:55,609
could bring it to the front and you're

27
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:59,888
done that'd be much appreciated so the

28
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,360
agenda we have four drafts on the agenda

29
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,509
in addition to the working group this

30
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:14,779
working group status update any comments

31
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:16,699
on the agenda so a milestone so as usual

32
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:18,379
these are completely out of date and we

33
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,599
need to update them I've just these are

34
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:24,259
the ones from from the dates tracker

35
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,089
I've just quickly updated the milestone

36
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,339
regarding that the data plane solution

37
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,419
which is genève which has been submitted

38
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:36,110
for to the is three website to Martin

39
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:38,929
now but we need to we need to come up

40
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,319
with some some sensible timelines for

41
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:45,438
the rest of the milestones so watch this

42
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,229
space any comments on the and the

43
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:54,829
milestones apart from they're out of

44
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:57,498
date ok document status so we have quite

45
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:02,599
a few RFC's but no new ones since the

46
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:06,979
last IETF our most recent one was our

47
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,699
CID 394 the split NVA document control

48
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,699
plan requirements

49
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,340
so an update on the data plane

50
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,190
encapsulation

51
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:20,549
so that's surgeon Eve draftin Eve which

52
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,169
was the data encapsulation identified by

53
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,530
a doe deplaning capsulation design team

54
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,469
is now with Martin

55
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,409
so we've requested publication for that

56
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:33,479
we have another draft which describes

57
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,279
the output of the data plane

58
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,890
encapsulation design team which I think

59
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,708
at the time we thought was useful to

60
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,140
publish something yeah yeah semi would

61
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,390
Ross yeah yeah I think I think I don't

62
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,760
think we are gonna update it more so so

63
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,910
it should be ready for the last court

64
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,670
okay

65
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:56,040
thank you okay I just get a show of

66
00:08:50,670 --> 00:09:01,829
hands of who recently was read the data

67
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:03,209
plan encapsulation draft okay it's

68
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,810
reasonable proportion of the number of

69
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,810
people in the room

70
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,260
okay so we'll probably take that to list

71
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,610
and do a poll because we you know it's a

72
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,350
pretty mature document it was just the

73
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,050
output of the design team so we just

74
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:25,190
thought it was a good a good idea to at

75
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,180
the time to publish that really as a

76
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,370
documentation of our experience in

77
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,319
picking and encapsulation from multiple

78
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:37,760
competing encapsulations Martin do you

79
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:40,700
are something Martin has a routing ad

80
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm finally for the working group

81
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,529
believes that it's needed be aware that

82
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,350
typically on some of these types of

83
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:51,209
documents ideas she tends to ask whether

84
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,800
that's really needed to publish as an

85
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:57,180
IFC yeah this is this is more more for

86
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,949
the benefit of the broader eyes you have

87
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,699
to document the process by which we

88
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,140
picked picks an encapsulation format

89
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,660
when we had quite a lot of controversy

90
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,649
around which encapsulation should move

91
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,230
forward and this is something that

92
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,420
happens repeatedly in different working

93
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,910
groups so it's really okay is that clear

94
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,860
early in the document that that's the

95
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,449
time yeah all mission were fine yeah

96
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,449
okay should be

97
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,939
okay we in working group last call so he

98
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:30,480
had the eevn applicability to dodging

99
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,620
Eve which is currently with the document

100
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,620
shepherd so that went through working

101
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,160
group last call there wasn't any

102
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,529
objection to that

103
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,810
I think Samuel you're handling that you

104
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,630
only give an update on where are you I

105
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,400
think B Shepherd rate updates or do so I

106
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:52,170
will be doing that tough for the 80th

107
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:53,819
meeting we also had a virtual machine

108
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,339
mobility draft that some of you may

109
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,460
remember that went through working group

110
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,740
last call last year it also had some

111
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,710
reviews and quite a lot of discussion on

112
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,540
the list from TSV area review team the

113
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,930
ops Directorate and there was also a

114
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,770
routine Directorate review and I think

115
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,199
that the some of the issues that were

116
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:19,350
raised by the TSV are not direct reviews

117
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:24,600
weren't fully addressed by the editor at

118
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:30,560
the time and the auditor has since gone

119
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:35,459
absent so we have a we have a volunteer

120
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:43,829
to pick up the pen on the draft much as

121
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:49,040
Linda why has that gone others it looks

122
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,040
like we have a technical problem

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:12:00,040
there we go yeah I'm quite sure what

124
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,870
happen there so hopefully we'll be able

125
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,810
to move forward with that document and

126
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,000
get those get those get those reviews

127
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,890
addressed I don't think there was any

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,270
other real problems with the that they

129
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,689
were raised during the during the last

130
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,610
call I think it was mostly some some

131
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,680
comments that were raised during these

132
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:22,510
these area reviews that needed to be

133
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,819
addressed properly so thanks Linda it

134
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:30,550
was unfortunately not here for picking

135
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:36,160
her up there's actually a bad connection

136
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:40,140
this table Tom Mizrahi just a short

137
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,209
question regarding the the excellent GPE

138
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:48,880
document we have a plan to publish that

139
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:50,590
in the future so yeah so so so now that

140
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,360
genève has been published

141
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,930
well not been published yet but now

142
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,910
Geneva's with with the ASG so I think

143
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,609
just to refresh the working groups

144
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,819
memory the original decision was that

145
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:09,180
the other encapsulation drafts could go

146
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:11,410
forward as informational or experimental

147
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,020
following following a publication of

148
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,350
Geneva so that's really yeah I mean it's

149
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:21,970
kind of up to the up to the authors to

150
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:23,320
at least refresh the drafts and so so

151
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,420
can I get a show of hands maybe who has

152
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,850
read any of those other encapsulation

153
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:37,719
drafts and such as VX and GPA recently

154
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:39,100
okay if you I think it would be I mean

155
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,630
we did promise we would do that and a

156
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,460
working group agreed to do that so I

157
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,260
think we should probably maybe after the

158
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,300
design team encapsulation draft has been

159
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,500
published it's gone to the is you it'll

160
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,939
be good good time to then thanks then so

161
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,980
then publish those because then then

162
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,570
then a little bit of context to the is G

163
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,240
about why we're going forward and

164
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,270
publishing or so publishing these some

165
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:06,610
other end cap drafts okay

166
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:12,550
Gregory ET I appreciated to tell

167
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:17,050
so you mentioned that because GUI went

168
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:20,109
to different area for its own fat

169
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:25,689
so the excellent GP you consider it to

170
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:27,879
be informational or experimental yes yes

171
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:30,430
okay yeah because this working group

172
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:35,860
decided to pick one standard track okay

173
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,779
how much of influence you see that the

174
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,730
working group will have over the

175
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,259
informational experimental track

176
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,970
document well they're still working

177
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:47,470
group documents here they're not

178
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,149
individual submissions to the to the RFC

179
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,740
editor there that's not the track it's

180
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,199
not like when we originally did the X

181
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,699
line and I went to individual in which

182
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,490
case we didn't really we didn't know

183
00:14:54,699 --> 00:15:00,219
that this must be owned because it's in

184
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:03,399
my interpretation of experimental and

185
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,699
and information it's just reflective

186
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,529
whatever being implemented so it's not

187
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:10,269
that I think that's true for

188
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:14,529
experimental but for informational it's

189
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:16,089
definitely can be more than that yeah

190
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,860
because I said in either case they're

191
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,129
still working group documents okay

192
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,740
because I do have strong concerns about

193
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:28,360
what they've done in their recent

194
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,550
versions okay given that they are

195
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,089
working group documents I think working

196
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,219
group has a say in how the document is

197
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,809
going to be sure yeah because yeah I

198
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,350
appreciate your clarification because

199
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:45,219
again in the standards it's quite clear

200
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:47,500
in my mind that their editors in the

201
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,199
working group is working with the

202
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,069
document but with informational

203
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:56,170
experimental it's yeah I don't know if

204
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:58,420
for the experimental case Martin do you

205
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,250
have any comment on that because I think

206
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,679
that's probably more why the ambiguity

207
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,339
is isn't that so so I guess the question

208
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:08,439
is if px 1 GP for example is published

209
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,379
as experimental or goes forward as an

210
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:12,699
experimental document how much say does

211
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:15,399
the working group have over the

212
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:17,019
technical details of the draft because

213
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,740
of course it's documenting an

214
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,740
implementation

215
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:37,330
again and that's my interpretation of

216
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:41,710
experimental that it reflective of in

217
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:44,050
some cases we have at ITF where their

218
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:49,000
implementation or defect the standard

219
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:52,000
being put on an informational track but

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,260
experimental is more of really

221
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,660
reflective of some experience of

222
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:03,069
particular implementation so basically

223
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,770
that you know we cannot really say oh

224
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,150
you should have implemented differently

225
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,119
because the response I would imagine

226
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:16,570
will be no but did it this way you might

227
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:18,429
disagree but well at this point it's

228
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:22,200
informational so maybe we can leave it

229
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:26,080
that way and avoid the potential issues

230
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:29,260
well my understanding is that if we

231
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,080
don't have any buddy from the this group

232
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,350
of working with the vehicle NGP document

233
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,490
I think that needs to be discussed with

234
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,959
them what they would like to do I think

235
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,540
we kind of need to have a consensus of

236
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,820
its working group as well as to which

237
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,920
way forward I want to go with with this

238
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,810
if it's just simply uh I mean you know

239
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,130
you can argue probably they could be

240
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,629
experimental because we have one

241
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,070
standard stripe document so why are we

242
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,330
arguing over there or debating the

243
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,129
technical details of another

244
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,750
encapsulation why don't we just document

245
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:08,170
what's what's been implemented for the

246
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:09,370
other encapsulations it seems perhaps a

247
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,590
little contradictory to have one

248
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,149
informational I mean this is my personal

249
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,560
view it seems slightly contradictory to

250
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,940
have an informational document

251
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,620
describing encapsulation and the

252
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,820
standard strap document describing an

253
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,520
encapsulation the perhaps and the

254
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,460
perhaps an experimental description

255
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,690
might be more appropriate I think in my

256
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,550
view the main problem with the

257
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,880
experimental is that you need to revisit

258
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,879
it

259
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,649
two or three or whatever years

260
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,469
afterwards and if it's informational you

261
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:51,120
don't necessarily need to revisit it

262
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:53,190
okay okay so the security requirements

263
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,860
draft that's on the agenda

264
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,370
it's next up on the agenda I just want

265
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,929
to have a notes about there's a draft

266
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:05,669
that was originally discussed in the BFD

267
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:07,170
working group for BFD over genève and it

268
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,700
doesn't really propose any changes to

269
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,680
BFD I think it's not more about how you

270
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,960
encapsulate in Geneva and there was some

271
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,550
discussion with the between the BFD and

272
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,150
the NVA for three chairs about where

273
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:20,580
this document should be progressed and

274
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,820
the feeling amongst the chairs was it

275
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,280
should go forward in nvo three yes and

276
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,860
we followed on your suggestion and we

277
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,680
resubmitted it yeah with the individual

278
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,419
draft in the or three okay yeah so we

279
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,270
were we are not presenting at this time

280
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:42,600
so okay I think well we died says from

281
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,800
some review review of that draft and we

282
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,179
would like to go forward or we think we

283
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,500
should go for it with a working group

284
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,920
adoption poll if there sufficient

285
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,020
interest in the working group okay so

286
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,610
has can I get a show of hands does

287
00:19:52,020 --> 00:20:01,230
anyone actually has anyone read this

288
00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:02,969
document let's draft you know and we

289
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:06,600
definitely did a little bit more people

290
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,850
were reading it may be great if you can

291
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,510
send something to the list asking for

292
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:21,449
review but yes actually

293
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:25,140
as a golfer we won't ask you first let's

294
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,080
discuss there encapsulation draft so

295
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,770
then we'll take this feedback from there

296
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,169
in via encapsulation discussion use it

297
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,389
in our view of this document and then

298
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:43,190
we'll do a discussion of the deity

299
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:46,580
document okay okay sorry that's the

300
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,580
working group stay

301
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:12,170
don't know thank you

302
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:16,100
hi so I'm gonna present a little bit the

303
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:18,260
security around Geneva so it's it's not

304
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,409
especially focused on the requirements

305
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,809
draft but it's a how we envision I mean

306
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,720
Jenny of security the problem we have

307
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:30,670
with the currently defined unit and how

308
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:37,160
we would like that to be moved forward

309
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:40,640
so yeah genève without transit devices

310
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,970
is really a hand and to end protocol so

311
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,240
we can use the end-to-end security so if

312
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:54,110
you're willing to use IPSec or DTLS

313
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:56,780
works perfectly fine when you when you

314
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,120
have transit device things change

315
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,740
completely depending on what you want to

316
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,100
disclose to the transit device and what

317
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,670
you don't want to disclose but it is a

318
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:12,010
fact that using end to end security

319
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:14,600
protocol you will always result in a I'm

320
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:18,290
hiding everything to the transit device

321
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,439
or I'm disclosing everything to the full

322
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:30,320
world and so there is a balance we need

323
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:33,320
to find that so that's what I can

324
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:38,600
illustrate with this payload so if you

325
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:42,590
have envy both nve are interpreting all

326
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,419
the options so you have the packet that

327
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,510
is transmitted from one and V to the

328
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:52,390
other one if you secure that with DLA

329
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:58,040
DTLA the same with is a layer below but

330
00:22:52,390 --> 00:23:00,740
if the in that case TLS will provide an

331
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:04,428
integrity and confidentiality protection

332
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:07,429
for that jean-yves packet from one env

333
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:08,700
to the other one so in this case we

334
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:12,180
assume that

335
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,760
nver processing all options and all the

336
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:19,350
header and the payload and and so on and

337
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:23,220
the purpose of TLS is and DTLS is really

338
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:27,659
to to prevent that someone in the middle

339
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:34,650
can intercept read or do whatever it's

340
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:37,640
doing with that gene if packets so the

341
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,590
contradiction is that when you're

342
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,650
introducing a transit device you you're

343
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:49,199
sort of defying the purpose of the

344
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:52,110
security so as I mentioned earlier you

345
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,120
have two choice either you disclosed

346
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:59,459
everything so no protection at all or

347
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,250
you provide I mean you you bypass the

348
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:07,350
transit device so suppose we are in a

349
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:11,520
situation where envy is a providing

350
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:14,580
option a B and C and the other hand nbe

351
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,310
is provided is only processing option a

352
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:22,290
but the transit device is supposed to

353
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:24,330
process option B and C so if without any

354
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,030
protection while the packet is sent

355
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,389
through transit device the transit

356
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:34,080
device as a full access to everything in

357
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:37,910
Geneva packet is processing option B and

358
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:44,610
C and you move that to nve that is

359
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:47,040
processing option a if you use DTLS well

360
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:53,129
the thing is that the transit device can

361
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:56,850
process the expected options BCD so only

362
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,380
option a will be processed I mean in

363
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,790
that example the transit device is

364
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:05,460
completely bypassed so you you either

365
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,080
had this way disclosing everything so

366
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,300
transit device here might be the

367
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,399
legitimate one you may have another one

368
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:16,139
that is not legitimate but they have the

369
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:19,860
same access to the same data if you use

370
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,799
DTLS while all the transit device has

371
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,610
been removed

372
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:27,679
so the current genius specification

373
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:31,580
specifies that transit device can only

374
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,999
read and I think everyone agree with

375
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,999
that it's okay it's fine but if you

376
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:42,320
disclose everything and you don't

377
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:46,519
provide any mechanisms I mean we don't

378
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,999
have genius police so if the device you

379
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:53,269
you have no way to enforce this only

380
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:56,869
read so it's only that you trust that

381
00:25:53,269 --> 00:26:01,340
the transit device are behaving in a in

382
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:04,009
a in a good manner so we need I mean the

383
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,009
purpose of the security here is really

384
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:10,309
to if we have opted agreed it doesn't

385
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:12,379
mean he can't cause arm we really have

386
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:16,100
to provide some mechanisms that and

387
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:19,189
force that the transit device may access

388
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,789
to some information we can't do anything

389
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:26,299
else then reading that information and

390
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:30,529
then we must also be able to limit the

391
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:32,899
information the transit devices having

392
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:36,559
access to I mean that you want to

393
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:39,350
transit device to read an option you may

394
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,139
not want him to read the full packet or

395
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,988
being able to monitor whatever traffic

396
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:49,279
is being provided from one and ve to the

397
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:53,389
other one and so that's why you also

398
00:26:49,279 --> 00:27:00,519
need some sort of encryption so with

399
00:26:53,389 --> 00:27:03,769
friends device if you would like that so

400
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:07,629
transit device so two things I mentioned

401
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:09,799
and forcing the radio only the data and

402
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:14,918
restricting the data are being accessed

403
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:17,539
by the transit device so on this graph

404
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,899
what I'm trying to show is that if you

405
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:26,230
want to disclose some options to the

406
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:31,699
transit device then you can't use DTLS

407
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:34,570
so one way to do and I'm happy to to

408
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,570
have other ways but

409
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,320
can I move in oh there is a pointer yeah

410
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:47,260
okay

411
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:51,390
so one way to do is that okay we need to

412
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:54,910
disclose the option and maybe the

413
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,330
Jeanette fixed header so that I mean

414
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,860
where you have the the network

415
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:03,310
identifier because that's might be used

416
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:06,520
for routing purpose so okay so this

417
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:10,510
should be disclosed because those are

418
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:13,840
going to be used by a transit device but

419
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,250
those we don't need to disclose them

420
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,580
because they are not useful for the

421
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:21,280
transit device and actually we don't

422
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:26,260
want this transit device to have access

423
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:29,110
to this data so one way to do is to do

424
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:33,100
make to provide a security option that

425
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:36,010
says everything after is going to be

426
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,250
encrypted and that's gonna be negotiated

427
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:42,760
with this one so this layer is encrypted

428
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,280
the transit device can't read this but

429
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:51,100
he can't read what is supposed to read

430
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:53,379
and then because I mean I'm telling the

431
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,230
transit device AAA you're not you're

432
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,690
only allowed to read I mean if you've

433
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,690
rights you will change the data you have

434
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:05,440
to be able to to check that is only

435
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:08,980
gonna read that data so you need a kind

436
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,880
of security authentication so I put a

437
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:17,830
security option that's ID okay these are

438
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:21,850
the data I'm disclosing to that transit

439
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:24,540
device and that's going to be

440
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:27,790
authenticated so in case you change that

441
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,350
this one will be able to check a sum

442
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:33,389
option has been changed it's not the

443
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:37,990
packet that this nve has been emitted am

444
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:40,360
issuing so basically the the

445
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,230
communication is sealed between this and

446
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,649
ve and with such mechanisms you can

447
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:51,540
disclose some information to

448
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:56,460
transit device I mean do we have any

449
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:59,399
question on why we do that and why DTLS

450
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,340
or regular end-to-end security protocol

451
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:06,480
doesn't work here I'm having to take any

452
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,790
question so why do you swallow semi

453
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,010
Boutros from VMware the game but are you

454
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:19,260
saying we encrypt one option so no okay

455
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:23,360
so we'll include absorptions I mean so

456
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:26,940
here I'm saying it's it's like a marker

457
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,678
it's a proposed solution so so that can

458
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,100
be just I don't think that will work

459
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,600
right because you know the option lens

460
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,219
has to be known to the header right so

461
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,678
you cannot encrypt some and leave

462
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,300
summary I think what we discussed is

463
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:45,740
that will only do a sonication right so

464
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:48,050
this option basically will say from here

465
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,540
it's gonna be encrypted

466
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:53,700
and you can have you mean the whole

467
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,770
packet would be an option will be option

468
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,880
but as well that won't work because we

469
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:02,160
have a maximum length of okay okay so we

470
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,610
but the idea is to provide some needs to

471
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:09,420
say from the second great thing one

472
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:17,189
option may not be no no sorry can use

473
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:19,500
mine so what you're saying is that okay

474
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,020
options together and I mean the the the

475
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,900
length is specific so we can tank rip

476
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,940
the other thing I if we want to have

477
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,640
something going clears and we cannot

478
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,929
encrypt the options right

479
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:40,470
we cannot encrypt any option video right

480
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:44,580
I mean they are in this case in this

481
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:47,130
case what I'm suggesting is that this

482
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:50,370
option is going to be encrypted correct

483
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,720
which is not possible well not we can

484
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,879
discuss it off location it's not

485
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,210
possible I think we discussed is having

486
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,910
is being able to Asante key and we can

487
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,670
you know I think we are saying we are

488
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:05,610
to read the option it would be good in

489
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,350
my opinion right to change some of the

490
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,030
option not add option but change it

491
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,219
which means that you can authenticate

492
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,530
some of the option not all options you

493
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,450
can pick what you want our son to get to

494
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:18,780
allow the midpoint to change some of the

495
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:21,300
options they want say what you would

496
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,850
like is that certain education whose

497
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,669
option they are sending very clear and

498
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,980
and if you want to allow some of the

499
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,390
option to change the authentication or

500
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,140
the hair should not include the option

501
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:35,790
oh yeah yeah yeah but I mean so what

502
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,030
you're saying is that the transit device

503
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:42,120
may change an option correct may updated

504
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:44,940
right okay so that's that's a different

505
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,129
requirement okay I think I think we

506
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,540
probably miss this one so may want to

507
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:51,480
consider this one like an application

508
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:56,820
but in terms of encrypting one option on

509
00:32:51,480 --> 00:33:00,590
the I don't think is possible so it's

510
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,590
feasible it might not be a good idea

511
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,439
okay so that we can discuss but okay um

512
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:10,740
I mean it may not it may makes no sense

513
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,010
to encrypt but not one option that's and

514
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,320
I mean the that's the kind of things

515
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,480
we'd like to know on how to design I

516
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,950
mean the security requirements to know

517
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,010
exactly what we would like to achieve

518
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,560
because we can end up in something very

519
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,360
complex which is what were you I think I

520
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,879
mean the requirement we have now are

521
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,530
pretty complex because we're kind of

522
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,830
opening all the different possibilities

523
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:36,960
so we might say it's funny

524
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:41,550
I think in my opinion in Krypton is a

525
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,520
fellow was the hosting okay it's payload

526
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:48,740
or whole thing options we Asante get the

527
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:51,270
whole thing what portion that's it so

528
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,660
watching what you are saying is that

529
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:55,920
either we anchor it from here to here

530
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:02,660
the whole thing

531
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:05,310
okay let's repeat it yeah that's yeah

532
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:08,240
I'd be saying we encrypt everything or

533
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:12,929
or is that beautiful only the payload

534
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,350
okay that's my opinion you know it's a

535
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,920
private

536
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,639
okay so which means all options will be

537
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,130
either correct or not correct and option

538
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,989
can be authenticated yeah all of them or

539
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:32,400
portion and violante oh yeah so okay so

540
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:32,879
I mean that's okay that's a that's a

541
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,700
good point

542
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,420
I mean I'm I'm fine yeah we can discuss

543
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,649
that

544
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:46,830
it's a languor thanks to Nikki yes I are

545
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:49,740
you hear me yeah yeah yeah me hear you

546
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:52,259
yes okay good so first of all I would

547
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:55,319
like to state their architectural II

548
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,940
what we envisioned is NV is an entry and

549
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,650
protocol I think I've explained this

550
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,120
multiple times during the you know in

551
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,560
the mailing list as well as part of the

552
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,040
review

553
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,870
it's an end-to-end protocol and so the

554
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,190
transit devices are nothing but

555
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,750
forwarding elements that are already

556
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,160
available in the underlay network you

557
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:16,050
know it could be routers or switches and

558
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,430
so on so if we you know they if there is

559
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,500
an end-to-end encryption is employed

560
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,240
which means that these forwarding

561
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,300
elements will not be able to see their

562
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,709
you know options header anything that's

563
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,540
perfectly fine and we have already

564
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,540
described saying that if such is the

565
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:34,950
case these elements which are called as

566
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:37,259
transit devices will have to forward it

567
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,210
like any other IP packet that's it right

568
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,140
so that's that's that's very clear and

569
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,220
these you know forwarding devices or

570
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,890
transit devices interpreting these

571
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,520
options is not an absolute requirement

572
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,779
for the functioning of the NTN protocol

573
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,360
so we did not you know an omission

574
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,520
saying that okay let's just show part of

575
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,440
this option to this particular transit

576
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,700
device and you know exchange keys

577
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,290
between the transit device in the

578
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,540
endpoint that was not the intent at all

579
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:07,140
and that's very clear if you read the

580
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:09,000
draft I mean there are many different

581
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,839
protocols like example if you take it in

582
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,970
RFC 8:08 6 which is GRE over UDP same

583
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,700
thing you know equivalent you know GRE

584
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,799
key is an equivalent to an option here

585
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,960
there is no you know requirement that

586
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,590
you go and just selectively encrypt or

587
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,250
decrypt or send it in the clear you know

588
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,319
just this GRE key so that

589
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,790
intermediate forwarding no need to look

590
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,960
at it no that's not the intent right

591
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,390
same here

592
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,170
I mean Geneva is no different than any

593
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:40,900
other European capsulation protocol so

594
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,550
this whole argument or you know talking

595
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,200
about saying that okay let's go and you

596
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,510
know show this partially partially

597
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,009
encrypt some parts of the options that's

598
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,349
not supported in the architecture and

599
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:53,069
that's not what we really wanted to go

600
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:53,069
out go in this direction

601
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,050
actually I think that in addition to

602
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:13,530
looking at the payload we need to look

603
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:18,970
at how this security framework will be

604
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:21,569
impacting active om okay because if we

605
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,569
want to do

606
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,740
[Music]

607
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,920
traceroute their tunnel that we're using

608
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:35,589
so to determine where in underlay we are

609
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,460
traversing the network so we need to

610
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:42,339
transcending and how to work if we're

611
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:45,369
doing encryption or we saying that om

612
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:47,290
would not be encrypted again would I

613
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:51,970
security will not acquire to add before

614
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:54,069
here okay again adjuster we're not

615
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:57,790
discussing it don't have to discuss

616
00:37:54,069 --> 00:38:01,240
challenges something to think about it

617
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:05,440
and look at how to work may work ok so

618
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:08,799
just one thing when you say oh am the

619
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,140
OEM isn't genève option no and that one

620
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,599
should be oh no it's a it's a bit in the

621
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:20,710
header is it okay the bitumen header now

622
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:23,140
refers to as a control packet will be

623
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:26,140
discussing om encapsulation later today

624
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,680
in a session what I'm just saying is

625
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:34,480
that active who I am

626
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:37,569
is specially constructed packet that

627
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,140
injected but what's important and

628
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:42,050
critical is that

629
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:45,259
active or a.m. follows the same path and

630
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,300
receives the same treatment as date of

631
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:54,100
law packet so basically they hate

632
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:57,820
sharing so would encrypting the data

633
00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:00,799
packets and for example possibly

634
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,700
speculating not encrypting test packets

635
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,210
will still enable us to do page sharing

636
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:11,600
or not so okay so that's something to

637
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:14,060
think about it again no no no no but I'm

638
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:18,380
I just want to understand so this means

639
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:21,259
the way I see that so it is that om is

640
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:25,340
implemented through maybe an option and

641
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,990
some fields in the fixed header no om

642
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,510
implemented through the payload Oh

643
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:35,750
within the payload okay and so what you

644
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:40,760
would like is that some payload would be

645
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:43,820
non-encrypted well again I I envisioned

646
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:48,140
that there is a need to traverse the

647
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:50,950
underlay tunnel and for that the payload

648
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:56,359
means to be visible the transit note

649
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:58,939
okay that's a I mean I mean we have to

650
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,420
check that how to make it but an it's

651
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:06,320
interesting again one possible scenario

652
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:08,210
is that we'll say okay there at the 4

653
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,580
a.m. for that purpose would not should

654
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:15,860
not be encrypted but the question then

655
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:18,770
is that would that still preserve or let

656
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:24,650
us preserve hate sharing with the data

657
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:28,550
flow some all dream Google just want to

658
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:31,940
act what thing if you're sending the

659
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:35,170
packet will your packet then the or just

660
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,670
the data plane itself is encrypted right

661
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,680
from end to end it doesn't mean anything

662
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,170
because you cannot peek into the payload

663
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,899
you respectively whether you're a

664
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,190
transit device or are so if that's how

665
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,910
it should because it should behave just

666
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,910
like any other day

667
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:55,130
I mean I mean otherwise you are pretty

668
00:40:52,790 --> 00:41:00,380
much breaking the the security whatever

669
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:02,930
you have set up for the so I have a

670
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:06,800
couple of for high-level questions the

671
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:08,660
first one is I know this was kind of

672
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,220
discussed but I just want to bring to

673
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,899
the notice of working group so we had

674
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:17,020
this as genève security requirements

675
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,760
Yeah right

676
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,340
why not mu or three because this is

677
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,860
nothing to do with specifically Jenny

678
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,320
this should be for the virtual networks

679
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:34,730
because we are driving the virtual

680
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:35,240
networks yeah so I would say there's an

681
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,890
vo3

682
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:43,220
got the option point as part of the data

683
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:46,940
plane and cap that is part of that then

684
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:48,770
kept protocol okay but so one reason is

685
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:54,470
that there is an envy of three

686
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:58,670
requirement document and but his draft

687
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:00,680
has not been continued so we started a

688
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:04,150
genève because one of the main

689
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:08,089
difference between the the security

690
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:11,330
requirements provide for n vo 3 did not

691
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:14,360
consider the transit device sure but

692
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:16,069
that goes to my question of like what is

693
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,350
transit device in the architectures but

694
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,640
that should be addressed from the

695
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:23,810
architecture perspective but not the

696
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:26,420
security should define on neither should

697
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,610
and cap define what trans appeals should

698
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,130
be part of the architect oh yeah yeah

699
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:33,860
definitely because I mean we are a

700
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:37,700
little bit like because we don't turn it

701
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,860
what those transit device do and I think

702
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:44,720
currently the situation we are is that

703
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:49,550
we said ok so this device have not been

704
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,129
defined at properly so well they can

705
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,370
have a single option they can read they

706
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:58,040
can have a single option dedicated for

707
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:01,430
that diversity can encrypt and so and

708
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,330
probably we are providing too many use

709
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,990
cases that are

710
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:08,180
not intended to be used so and Mister

711
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:11,720
but that goes to the solution aspect

712
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:15,560
here are the requirement aspect okay so

713
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,319
the solution or so from the requirement

714
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,540
perspective right yeah if the there is a

715
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,270
definition for what transit device ease

716
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,900
then the requirement should address and

717
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,850
they okay

718
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,030
right yeah yeah that's pretty much it if

719
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,860
you're considering this as end-to-end

720
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,870
protocol and you're going to define the

721
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,760
protocol for end-to-end then the

722
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,700
security should address the end to end

723
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,220
part of that and for the transit then we

724
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,899
need to I think Kamata can talk about

725
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,600
that what the transit how we are

726
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,120
planning to do that but we shouldn't be

727
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,700
defining what transit means as part of

728
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,259
the secure okay yeah so I think the

729
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,279
thing was when transit devices were

730
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,360
originally envisaged perhaps so some

731
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,680
people were saying they were more than

732
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,030
just just a Rooter

733
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,890
I mean they could be a firewall for

734
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,080
example or there could be some other box

735
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:06,980
that does some deep packet inspection or

736
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:09,740
something on the on the on the mvo 3

737
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,390
frame so and the prop but the problem is

738
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,009
that was never discussed or never

739
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,859
described as part of the MV o3

740
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:18,260
architecture any of that functionality

741
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:20,800
and so the only definition that we

742
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:23,960
really have of a transit devices in the

743
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,530
genève encapsulation draft which is a

744
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:31,940
little over you know it's problem may

745
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:35,300
not be a complete definition I think

746
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:38,630
from from what I understood from what

747
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,790
Ilan was saying if the transit device

748
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,850
will be only a router or of are all

749
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:46,779
exactly said Matthew right then it

750
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:49,040
shouldn't be inspecting any options

751
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,900
answer transit device here simply a

752
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,200
router should not be looking at option

753
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:56,030
it's on his Andy who looked right so so

754
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,299
and we can look and now when we are

755
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,650
talking about option between and bees

756
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,710
should we encourage them should be only

757
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:07,640
authentic ISM and that's about it so if

758
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:10,640
an NDE will if device will inspect the

759
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,259
options that is an MD yeah and I think

760
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,870
we can go that definition to that should

761
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:18,350
be fine that

762
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:20,420
there is no treasure device that inspect

763
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,819
option of course transit device exists

764
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,950
but only as router or as far towards the

765
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:28,150
floor as IP packet and cannot look

766
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:32,779
beyond IP back shouldn't shouldn't even

767
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:34,250
you know no the problem is that

768
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,310
statement should not look beyond we know

769
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:40,880
today that you just do because I saw

770
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:43,340
they do assume yeah if they do hashing

771
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,850
on five tuples or even seven couples are

772
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,710
looking at UDP or the transport layer

773
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:52,130
force they not look beyond layer four

774
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,570
right so so so the router even the Faro

775
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:57,320
right if you are talking about layer for

776
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:59,330
are old they look only at UDP ports or

777
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,890
TCP port so they look at therefore so

778
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:05,180
yes sure you can look at therefore if it

779
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:08,450
exists if then we decide to expose the

780
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,759
UDP header and the genève header and not

781
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,140
secure not encrypted then the router can

782
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:16,790
look at it and maybe this should be the

783
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:19,549
definition if everybody is okay with

784
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:25,520
that is that transit device really has

785
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:28,280
no role in the in enviously architecture

786
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,230
altogether and engineer as well as I

787
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,530
only exist because there are routers

788
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:37,370
that can switch back yeah well in fact

789
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:39,410
in practice this exists right the

790
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:42,650
devices you know is easy NP router for

791
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,720
example right they they look inside the

792
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,400
packet right they skip over possibly the

793
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,980
options and look inside the payload and

794
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,180
then might still employ easy MP policies

795
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:57,050
right so one second one second you you

796
00:46:53,180 --> 00:47:00,500
want the router here you look inside the

797
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:01,610
payload after the option and and and and

798
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,460
do something with it

799
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:07,010
it could that's what I am saying that we

800
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,280
don't we can't preclude that if the

801
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:13,040
packet isn't the clear no no one can

802
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,020
stop an intermediate device right in the

803
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,450
underlined network to peer into our look

804
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:20,000
into that information and then do what

805
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:22,339
it wants to do all we are saying is you

806
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,010
know we fit is looking into it then

807
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,450
there are certain you know restrictions

808
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,800
we are trying to run I know make the

809
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,399
people aware that if they are looking

810
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,480
into it

811
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,240
they're not supposed to do certain

812
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,539
things that's all we find in the job

813
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,490
okay I see so so so watch what you are

814
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:39,710
saying in other times it says the

815
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:43,399
transit device can do whatever he needs

816
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:46,630
to do to forwards a packet but really

817
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,980
not alter any a tiny eight on the back

818
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,509
that's exactly what we have to define in

819
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,309
the draft and if you're worried about

820
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:55,789
you know a transit device tampering with

821
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:57,079
the data then there's a possibility for

822
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,730
you to introduce the interior and

823
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,640
authentication mechanisms so that you

824
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,019
know no data integrity mechanism and

825
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,170
this thing's this what we are saying is

826
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:07,700
that the options what we are saying is

827
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:10,190
that the whole package includes a

828
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,848
transit device won't be able to look at

829
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:16,039
any payload here because it's encrypted

830
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:17,900
if you already or if it of the packet

831
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,700
goes in clear you are right the currency

832
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,859
device can do whatever it can do with it

833
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,919
but without changing anything of the

834
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:27,950
packet if security is in play with the

835
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,839
sonication for example right so so I

836
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,999
think yeah those absorption were

837
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,799
discussing I think we discussed an extra

838
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,200
option in which you are saying the

839
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:38,930
option header between and v-not a

840
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,730
transit and because I think with what

841
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,799
you are saying here who is handling

842
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,930
options really handling meaning

843
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:47,450
processing understanding what the option

844
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:50,029
is about and so on is going to be in

845
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,769
these not transit device that's correct

846
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:53,359
that's what we have a clearly explaining

847
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:55,339
the draft and what the security

848
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,380
requirement draft is trying to go on

849
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:59,089
interpret it's in one it's one way and

850
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,549
trying to give some solutions like what

851
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:03,440
you know Daniel is right now explaining

852
00:49:01,549 --> 00:49:04,910
and that's not what is supported in the

853
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,099
Geneva collection that's basically what

854
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:10,160
I am trying to say okay so so from

855
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:12,380
security aspect we just need not to have

856
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,930
any transient devices here we'll just

857
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,849
call them and be so there is no machine

858
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:18,618
will be there it will be there whether

859
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:26,450
we like it or not these are under layer

860
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:28,339
devices you know these are device will

861
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:32,328
not be there but what we are saying is

862
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:34,609
not playing a role in security right

863
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:36,440
meaning is not Osan ticketing is not

864
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:38,749
encrypting is not decree or it's not

865
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,550
doing any of that so where the device

866
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:43,899
exists

867
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:50,640
as from a security perspective as a

868
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:55,360
pass-through device but I think just to

869
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:58,150
what you said earlier was we do have

870
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,100
similar technologies like VPN and all

871
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:03,160
that stuff right and this is no

872
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,170
different to that so we shouldn't be

873
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,790
redefining like the partial lookup for

874
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:10,290
the transit device out there is no

875
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:12,490
specification or precedence to set like

876
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,870
parcel option and those kind of that's

877
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,410
what I'm trying to say Lachlan we

878
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:19,150
shouldn't be coming up with some new

879
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:21,850
requirement when other protocols which

880
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:25,300
are already in existence do not define

881
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:27,490
those this is not different I agree I

882
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,700
agree so I think the partial stuff that

883
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:33,540
I mentioned yes I I agree it's not if

884
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:36,790
they are Andes nows and yes they can

885
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:39,700
change the options on - I really hate

886
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:42,120
that scent again so so so yeah so the

887
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,350
whole option of the whole packet can be

888
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:48,339
encrypted was the whole packet can be

889
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:50,710
authenticated option and balaam except

890
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:53,710
that the final thing should we convert

891
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,660
this to a new or three requirements a

892
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:59,530
new or three security requirements

893
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:02,649
instead of general yeah so then we

894
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:06,460
shouldn't worry about transit I in terms

895
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:07,750
of security procedure but as Janine is

896
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,670
defining as the transit is the

897
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,830
pass-through device for packet whatever

898
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:14,170
it to is the packet it's its own

899
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:16,420
discretion but you but if security is in

900
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:21,910
place should not change any options of

901
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:25,600
that so in the Geneva we won't have any

902
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:29,379
transit device that am I correct in the

903
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:32,740
specification well so we will not have a

904
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:34,810
transit device from the security

905
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,950
Presidio perspective but the transit

906
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:41,170
would exist to still forward as a packet

907
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,939
but the problem we have is that if the

908
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:46,780
transit device is able to look at the

909
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,510
options he can look at the option but

910
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,760
he's not allowed to alter or touch it so

911
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,230
so you know going back to the the the

912
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,420
parallel with VPN architect

913
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:58,000
as we do at least recognized in I

914
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,710
believe in going back to that the

915
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,330
provided provisional VPN architecture

916
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:04,300
the fact that Peru what they call P

917
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:07,630
Reuters exists and they do describe them

918
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,980
so we're not defining we've got to

919
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,570
recognize that they're there so just

920
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,670
saying they don't exist but you can say

921
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,530
they do not touch you can say what they

922
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:17,680
do not do - they're well they're not

923
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:20,320
expected to do to the genève header okay

924
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,240
I think that's probably the western read

925
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,830
it brother won't they weren't I don't

926
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:31,660
terminate as soon as you terminate it

927
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:33,220
that's an envier you want to change

928
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,080
anything in it you're an MBA but you can

929
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,299
read it you know transit doors can read

930
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:43,810
it and you know some forward my son 14

931
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:46,840
decision but with no it's I want to

932
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:50,529
write you know but with no touching of

933
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,810
it right or altering it ya know we can

934
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:55,150
scope what it what it what it does to

935
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:57,369
genève or doesn't do to genève I said

936
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:59,950
from I hopefully who is saying here is

937
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:05,080
that Geneva penalties describing this

938
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:06,759
so if description is fines and they

939
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,490
already have a description but there's

940
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,900
nothing specific to Geneva bout this is

941
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:13,060
not special to Geneva it's just written

942
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,430
in a Geneva off because it wasn't been

943
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,720
done anywhere else ah yeah because you

944
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:19,359
need was technology because there will

945
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,859
be devices between and Vees that will

946
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,500
forth package because a lot of this

947
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:27,100
discussion arose after the MV o3

948
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:30,010
architecture was done so so maybe I for

949
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,779
exampie or three angrily architecture

950
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:34,570
probably assumed that there will be

951
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:37,690
transit device but we have no rule no

952
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:39,100
role for tech minuting tunnels in common

953
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,250
I don't recall the discussion even

954
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,150
coming up until we started talking about

955
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:47,800
transcending tracery of OEM

956
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:51,630
I see yeah but I think yeah there's REM

957
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:57,430
implications of these things as well so

958
00:53:51,630 --> 00:54:01,540
but but in terms of OEM as well you know

959
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:03,520
was three South and so on where it can

960
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,430
be treated like an IP packet right you

961
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,330
know an IP UDP packet a router if the TV

962
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:11,290
Alex

963
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,850
he would sends ICMP error back well for

964
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,860
the for the others for the under light

965
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:17,650
but I mean if you do something yeah but

966
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:23,470
there's ways that isn't sending as well

967
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:26,530
right yeah we I mean it's not refreshing

968
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:28,149
to it's not refresh recently but I think

969
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:33,040
the objective of that was to trace a

970
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:37,000
particular be and I I see where it went

971
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,040
through throwing the underlay yeah you

972
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,650
know I assume here was what you are

973
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,650
defining if security supplies and the

974
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:46,720
transit cannot really change any option

975
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:49,390
attack yeah but I thought that doesn't

976
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,520
affect exactly actually terminates and

977
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,350
replies somehow so even if you wanna do

978
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,570
or at least not be annoyed and should be

979
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:59,160
okay but a device that as a different

980
00:54:55,570 --> 00:55:01,570
behavior if it's secured on non secure

981
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,089
is bringing a contradiction into the

982
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:07,570
architecture because it means if you

983
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:12,940
want to secure that deployment you have

984
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:16,840
to balance that the ingress point and

985
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:18,790
the egress point are the only nodes who

986
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,770
are what allowed to touch that you need

987
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:23,890
and do anything is a packet right yeah

988
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:26,350
and and you know so if you are touching

989
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,569
your and enbe you are knitting a family

990
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,310
or an IV if you want to do trace route

991
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,260
between those two and V by transit

992
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:34,029
routers right it's fine to write because

993
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,500
they are not going to be touching

994
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,030
anything on the package that would

995
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,590
simply be sending errors back or

996
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:41,200
something right so some indication back

997
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:43,390
to the English point that yes I am on

998
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,149
the way yeah but the thing is that if

999
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,160
you have a deployment that is going

1000
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:50,770
through a transit device and you rely on

1001
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,560
the fact that he's inspecting the packet

1002
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:55,390
I won't be able to secure that that's

1003
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,190
fine but but that's the architecture

1004
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,900
that's the deployment scenario yeah

1005
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,070
they're like we do have like VCC we

1006
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,560
deployments we have different

1007
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:05,650
deployments right if you don't secure

1008
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:08,470
end-to-end then you are defining your

1009
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:10,720
network design yeah to make sure that

1010
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:12,459
others can actually inspect the packet

1011
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,439
but if you really want to do that you

1012
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:19,200
secure the whole payload including

1013
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:21,819
whatever exactly you so

1014
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,460
phillipians and these would be like one

1015
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:27,970
hobble a so in other words there is no

1016
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:30,160
requirement to say that there is a way

1017
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:36,069
for the transit device to look into that

1018
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:38,230
as long as the pail or the the network

1019
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:40,299
or the encapsulation allows it there is

1020
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,579
no requirement that it should or

1021
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:45,750
shouldn't do certain things selectively

1022
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:48,339
things if the end-to-end is encrypted

1023
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:53,529
period yeah I cannot look into that okay

1024
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:55,660
if it is not restricted or not encrypted

1025
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:56,410
then yeah in transit device can look

1026
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:02,140
into that

1027
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:05,078
yeah but yeah but if if you have a

1028
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:07,480
deployment where that is relying on

1029
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,880
those transit device and then you have

1030
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:13,960
been asked to say well can you secure

1031
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,670
does an ve to and ve communications yes

1032
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,250
you can secure it because you are either

1033
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,140
encrypting betweens MV so the transit is

1034
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,089
a pass through doesn't doesn't look

1035
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:24,190
doesn't know what's inside the packet or

1036
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:26,319
you can authenticate her and in that

1037
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:30,009
case yes he can look because the data is

1038
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,720
Cle but he cannot do much as well right

1039
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:34,809
you know he's only looking at what you

1040
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,779
sent in clear yeah but that's a huge

1041
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:39,789
impact I mean the deployment cannot be I

1042
00:57:37,779 --> 00:57:42,039
mean that the deployment of security is

1043
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:44,619
going to be deeply impacted by those

1044
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:46,000
transit device because depending on what

1045
00:57:44,619 --> 00:57:48,339
you are much of security I think a

1046
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,009
sensor is at your discretion you want to

1047
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:53,558
show stuff in clear or not if you don't

1048
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:55,480
want to stuff in clearer than is a facet

1049
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:57,279
is simply for routing an IP packet yeah

1050
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:05,500
but once you choose you can't go back

1051
00:57:57,279 --> 00:58:06,670
it's really hard so I think we should

1052
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,359
take this to this because we've got

1053
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:15,730
three more doors

1054
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:18,269
ok ok thanks Tanya thank you thank you

1055
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,269
sorry

1056
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:32,619
so hello everyone so here we arrive at

1057
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:34,720
the sixth version of this draft and you

1058
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:38,650
may notice that we have new members our

1059
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:40,990
design team especially we have one who

1060
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:43,470
is come who is the author of another

1061
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:48,520
young draft which is dedicated for

1062
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:51,669
genève and vixen TPE so the design

1063
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:55,119
methodology of this two draft is aligned

1064
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:58,660
and in the future the two draft will be

1065
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,910
well coordinated so the first day I

1066
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:06,270
would like to recall the motivation of

1067
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:09,399
this draft so in ITF for the in terms of

1068
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:10,990
network virtualization overlay the data

1069
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,600
plane and the control plane have been

1070
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:17,109
covered and that there are several

1071
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:20,230
ability the works on it and clearly the

1072
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:25,420
Yamato is still a gap so to be covered

1073
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:27,340
and why we start with a base a very

1074
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,609
young because there are several

1075
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:34,390
encapsulations and vivian technologies

1076
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:37,779
and if we run to run directly into

1077
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:41,109
individual calculations will run out run

1078
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:45,930
into with a positive works and a non

1079
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:48,819
consistent approach so it is better to

1080
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:53,230
start with a common and reusable young

1081
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:55,510
in the first place and it can be used at

1082
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:59,320
the start point for individual

1083
00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:03,160
encapsulation two people can actually

1084
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:05,820
element the space young any type one

1085
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:10,740
necessary to define the young model for

1086
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:15,730
individual encapsulation and in this

1087
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:18,779
base area model we will use we have used

1088
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:21,010
the reference eyes such as vo3

1089
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:25,510
RCS for example the framework

1090
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:31,640
architecture and we have used the rigid

1091
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:34,640
RCS and works in progress in ATF so

1092
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:37,400
there is a relatively significant change

1093
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,009
in the current version and in the

1094
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:43,100
previous previous version the NVE is

1095
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:45,410
defined as a container and inside this

1096
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,370
container we defined as the via

1097
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:53,000
instances and but now we define mve as

1098
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:56,330
an interface actually Ignace has a

1099
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,810
comment during the last ITF and we think

1100
01:00:56,330 --> 01:01:02,240
it is a good idea so we adopt it and now

1101
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:06,460
the e is defined as an interface via

1102
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:10,669
augmenting the ITF interface young and

1103
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:15,490
and in the pace I will three young

1104
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:19,040
module we have indicated which and the e

1105
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:22,370
interface that the via instance a snotty

1106
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:25,160
to so basically the relationship between

1107
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:31,640
the VI and the NVE is still the same but

1108
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:34,940
here we use different logic and here you

1109
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:37,850
have the the sauce with high P which is

1110
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:42,620
the address of the Anika's it way if it

1111
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:45,490
is enabled here and if it it is enabled

1112
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:49,460
we should have a bypass with high P to

1113
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:53,709
you know to identify uniquely the AE

1114
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:57,560
inside of this and it has to get way and

1115
01:01:53,710 --> 01:02:01,090
this style gives you a impression about

1116
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:06,500
house and very busy is mapped to the

1117
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:10,190
architecture and inside the the base a

1118
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:14,780
very young module we we define the via

1119
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:17,270
instances and here we the the via ID is

1120
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:20,510
configured and used as a K of the VI

1121
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:23,780
instance and here as you can see we have

1122
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:27,440
the source and ve indicating that which

1123
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:31,760
and we'll a very interface is mount 82

1124
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:35,170
and we have also a PDP control plane in

1125
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:39,140
Ebola to indicate if the AES

1126
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:41,120
are configured dynamically there's a bit

1127
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:44,150
difficult controlling or it is

1128
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,440
configurable study statistically and if

1129
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:48,920
it is the later case

1130
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:54,760
the the static appear and they define

1131
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:59,030
here so we also have the the multicast

1132
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:02,990
group per defined per VM basis and for

1133
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:07,910
different very I we can have different

1134
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:11,089
multicast service note and another

1135
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:16,040
change a that the mapping between the l2

1136
01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:19,970
VPN or I Australian to the to to to the

1137
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:24,560
via instance it is now defined by

1138
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:28,970
augmenting the ITF l2 Vivian or our sway

1139
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:31,369
VPN module and pre in the previous

1140
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:35,328
version the mapping relationship between

1141
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:39,400
the VI and I - oh I also really n it is

1142
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:39,400
defined in the V container

1143
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:45,530
so next step

1144
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,328
we open to your comments and if you

1145
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,780
think that we are moving in the right

1146
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:51,319
direction

1147
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:53,270
or the idea to define the base your

1148
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:56,420
module is the right direction please

1149
01:03:53,270 --> 01:04:03,980
consider our deficits draft eyes working

1150
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:05,329
group document so any comment you can I

1151
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:08,140
get a show of hands for please raise

1152
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:11,950
your hand if you've read this document

1153
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:16,690
that's quite a good number of people

1154
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:16,689
okay thank you

1155
01:04:35,529 --> 01:04:42,319
so good afternoon my name is Sammy

1156
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:48,259
Boutros from VMware I'm presenting the

1157
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:56,930
Mac move draft so yeah we presented this

1158
01:04:48,259 --> 01:05:00,559
draft I think last year so so the idea

1159
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:05,890
here is that the use case we are talking

1160
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:08,660
about here is a dual homed device right

1161
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:10,190
between nuts a couple of and the year

1162
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:12,140
and we are doing data clean Mac learning

1163
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,359
so so so we're talking here about data

1164
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:19,009
plane Mac learning with a do at home

1165
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:22,848
device so now you know that do at home

1166
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:24,680
device if there would be a failure so so

1167
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:27,319
here's the door at home device as well

1168
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:31,879
is the axis here is not villain

1169
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:33,829
it's it is a genève tunnel between what

1170
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,789
we call they have to service and then

1171
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:41,599
these so so you have a genève tunnel

1172
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:43,489
between the nve's of course and between

1173
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,640
the layer 2 device and then V so now

1174
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:47,630
those and V is of course they can be

1175
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:50,868
talking control planes they can be

1176
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:55,219
talking evpn talking whatever control

1177
01:05:50,869 --> 01:06:01,160
plane to distribute max or mac IP

1178
01:05:55,219 --> 01:06:03,559
bindings and now if the primary path for

1179
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:06,729
the dual home device goes down then

1180
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:10,249
there is no way for the dual home device

1181
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:14,019
to know that he is going now to be

1182
01:06:10,249 --> 01:06:19,189
getting traffic from the backup and V so

1183
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:22,848
for for it to know that we are proposing

1184
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:26,569
the extension so again in simple term a

1185
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:29,239
device that device could be hypervisor

1186
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:35,089
for example the old ho doing home to two

1187
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:37,039
and these two leaves to two tours and he

1188
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:40,880
is setting up be excellent tunnel to

1189
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:44,569
those envies sorry setting up genève

1190
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,990
tunnels to those envies and now the env

1191
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:49,560
is there is a failover

1192
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:51,990
between a primary to the backup and B

1193
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,700
and the backup and V has to give an

1194
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:56,669
indication to the device sighing okay

1195
01:06:53,700 --> 01:07:01,250
hey switch over HAP so this is it right

1196
01:06:56,670 --> 01:07:09,780
you know so are saying we can have a new

1197
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:12,720
genève option TLB and this option TLV we

1198
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:15,210
can send on the genie packet right to

1199
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,419
send the failover notification when the

1200
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:23,190
backup or the standby and B becomes

1201
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:25,740
active and the document describe a very

1202
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:30,359
simple protocol following what we did as

1203
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:33,509
well for MPLS TP for MPLS CP we had a

1204
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:34,770
Mac withdrawal draft and the document

1205
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,750
here follows the same thing follow

1206
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:38,640
exactly the same protocol it's a very

1207
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:45,300
simple data pass protocol to increase to

1208
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:48,390
I to increase of course reliability and

1209
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:52,470
make sure that that message will arrive

1210
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:56,250
for example to the device sign that the

1211
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:58,709
back up sending saying I am now active

1212
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:02,460
and ve and all the Mac that you learned

1213
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:06,480
from as a primary and ye are now visible

1214
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:16,410
Barney so I think ensures that said any

1215
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:20,149
comments ok never done Nokia can you go

1216
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:20,149
back to the diagram please

1217
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:27,420
so the target scenario is basically you

1218
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:29,640
are building this hierarchical jean-yves

1219
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,770
so it's not hierarchical it's not hard

1220
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:35,640
like you mentioned from the wave 2

1221
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:37,580
device as a genève tunneled genève

1222
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,040
tunnels access access Ginny

1223
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:44,640
okay in the other side you have the

1224
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,310
other side you know can be anything can

1225
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,290
be mesh of course sorry could be mesh of

1226
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:52,500
tunnels could be MPLS could be anything

1227
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:54,450
so could be EVP and based yeah yeah yeah

1228
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,880
of course this what I mentioned as well

1229
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:59,700
it may not be very clear here but the

1230
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,740
other side could be MPLS based

1231
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,720
think I think what what's being said

1232
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:06,540
here if he imagines the whole network is

1233
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:09,210
this a plane learning right data pin

1234
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:12,180
McCloud nning than the other side can

1235
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:14,640
use exact same similar mechanism but if

1236
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:16,710
you use a data plane so the messages

1237
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,430
that you are defining haha basically

1238
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:23,850
what they say is okay there was a move

1239
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:26,130
correct and from an old and feet up to a

1240
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:29,790
new Vita correct that's it but you do

1241
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:32,220
not define a list of MAC address no no

1242
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,550
no no only all what you learned from the

1243
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:36,690
old

1244
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:38,940
a reachable Navami it's not yes MPLS TP

1245
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:40,710
mac was rural stuff was defining a list

1246
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:42,569
of Mac knows that's not doing that you

1247
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,130
know it so what well here and what that

1248
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:49,259
means is that basically you only have 1

1249
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:51,660
layer 2 device right because so MGE 2 is

1250
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:55,020
the one sending this mac move message ah

1251
01:09:51,660 --> 01:10:09,540
correct right correct what you're

1252
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:11,430
telling the the remote nve's 800 i have

1253
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,930
to have this a slight a you see the

1254
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:16,320
super confusing forever

1255
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:27,350
ah no no no okay okay I think yeah this

1256
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:29,820
was all slight going back to the device

1257
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:50,780
so they are telling their layer 2 device

1258
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:53,370
that all moved but evpn you switch yeah

1259
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,650
the about money signaling arrows going

1260
01:10:53,370 --> 01:11:00,269
the wrong way isn't it on that towards

1261
01:10:55,650 --> 01:11:13,629
to let it should be ok so yeah I'm

1262
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:17,769
trying to you have to tell

1263
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:19,329
well first of all you you advertise MAC

1264
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:23,050
addresses from a given Ethernet segment

1265
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:25,570
so you tell others flush MAC addresses

1266
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:29,979
from this Ethernet segment not from a

1267
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:32,349
feet up to a different video right you

1268
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:35,709
will move it up if you are doing my

1269
01:11:32,349 --> 01:11:38,019
cloning on Zack's it's very confusing

1270
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:41,349
for me sorry I can't discuss stuff line

1271
01:11:38,019 --> 01:11:43,689
if it's not clear I'm gonna clarify move

1272
01:11:41,349 --> 01:11:46,599
the slide as well so Allah I will update

1273
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:50,050
the draft you okay thank you no prom

1274
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:51,579
just ensure so I agree on the comment

1275
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:54,459
it's confusing high rated number of

1276
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:56,170
times okay okay and some of the name is

1277
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:59,079
confusing as well because it's not

1278
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:02,019
really that much mock has moved is that

1279
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:04,780
the interface became unavailable so

1280
01:12:02,019 --> 01:12:07,090
you're pretty much signaling you've got

1281
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:09,688
some relationship between and we won and

1282
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:17,889
we did from from the service perspective

1283
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:21,489
so if you've got the relationship so you

1284
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:25,030
just need to tell the layer to service

1285
01:12:21,489 --> 01:12:26,619
in this case that yes which is down so

1286
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:29,530
it's not really much move its everything

1287
01:12:26,619 --> 01:12:37,469
move right you just move from one

1288
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:37,469
interface to another you flush no so you

1289
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:47,170
understand but the service you represent

1290
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:48,938
here is going to rewrite the destination

1291
01:12:47,170 --> 01:13:02,849
for hallmark addressed have learned from

1292
01:12:48,939 --> 01:13:22,659
envied want in v2 right so it's not just

1293
01:13:02,849 --> 01:13:24,240
to be confusing now when you explain it

1294
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:27,040
here clear

1295
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:32,559
but I will have is enough to make it to

1296
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:34,990
match the explanation singing actually I

1297
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,650
think we did more or less the stimulus

1298
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:40,450
thing

1299
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:41,799
true before so there are some sorry

1300
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,139
sorry cRIO

1301
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:49,990
there is another protocol episode

1302
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:51,760
concluded was called there are some

1303
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:53,830
ideas we could borrow there are some

1304
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,830
tricky points here for example for the

1305
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:58,960
meu 1 & 2 you see the step primary

1306
01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:01,870
standby are they supposed to use some

1307
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,550
like any caste IP address for both of

1308
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:07,180
them no they are using different IP

1309
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:08,740
addresses there are two yeah yeah yeah

1310
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:11,110
yeah of course of course if you want to

1311
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:14,290
use any caste that's another approach I

1312
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:18,160
I'm talking here about any caste non any

1313
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:19,900
caste approach for the for the Mac move

1314
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:24,820
signal if you think kind of thing is

1315
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:28,769
like 20 days yeah ARP so it looks like

1316
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:32,769
to me it's possible you just you know

1317
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:35,380
making this assumption to are on the

1318
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,720
same layer to segment and we can use to

1319
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:43,870
the device

1320
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:46,500
you know graduates are or or when when

1321
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:50,019
the any caste switched from an v1 and v2

1322
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:53,980
Xan we do not need to do anything at the

1323
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:56,290
device so you just now you said it's not

1324
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,780
um the black arrows they are not

1325
01:14:56,290 --> 01:15:02,710
multicast Iraq is a multi post single

1326
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:04,900
correct not equal unicast okay so so for

1327
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:07,650
the MA two to one there is no special

1328
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:09,910
tunnel because that is that is the

1329
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:19,540
special time no different from all the

1330
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:23,139
others okay I I guess I think I think

1331
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:28,030
you know the slide was talking about an

1332
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:30,700
old genève data clean Mac learning stuff

1333
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:33,730
right but what will change just to make

1334
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:36,130
sure it's it's clear and very easy to

1335
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:37,990
understand is that we won't care about

1336
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:40,390
the core of the networks

1337
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:43,389
cloud sing the core of the net who won't

1338
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:46,720
care about it only the access is what

1339
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:48,300
we'll focus on right and it's similar to

1340
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:51,010
the war if you are familiar to the war

1341
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:53,860
we switch from primary to backup and we

1342
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:56,740
send in pseudo arias and what we call a

1343
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:58,210
pseudo our status so this very similar

1344
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:03,190
pseudo our status but you are sending a

1345
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:06,370
tin band engineer this kind somehow

1346
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:08,589
should be required that okay the

1347
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:10,690
McKenney and my guess me I will update

1348
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:13,510
the mechanism and he send comments yeah

1349
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:15,610
you know I'll update so mechanism wait

1350
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:22,180
for the refresh and the mechanism would

1351
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:24,790
be very clear done so if I ask an

1352
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:28,060
obvious question but so the the Mac move

1353
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:30,970
signal goes within the in even caps

1354
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:33,280
relational data plane correct okay so

1355
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:36,580
you need data plane traffic to trigger

1356
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,860
they update yes no no it's a special

1357
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:42,400
message you send a genève packet with

1358
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:46,030
the option was no data no payload you

1359
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:50,559
don't need traffic to send it so if you

1360
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:54,120
need a contraband signal sure if you

1361
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,120
want to call it this way okay

1362
01:16:55,170 --> 01:17:05,700
thank you any more comments okay thanks

1363
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:05,700
folks okay thanks to me Greg

1364
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:26,119
okay so the question is then we had a

1365
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:34,310
very good discussion in Prague is how we

1366
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:38,059
encapsulate active om and genève so what

1367
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:39,560
is active or am active om uses specially

1368
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:42,800
constructed packets the monitor

1369
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:45,340
troubleshoot localized effects and must

1370
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,960
be not leaked out of Janine's domain and

1371
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:51,110
multiple active or a.m. are required to

1372
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:55,310
support oops for management performance

1373
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:57,889
monitoring fault management active Orion

1374
01:17:55,310 --> 01:18:03,560
protocols must be clearly identifiable

1375
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:06,460
in Geneva so we have four options for

1376
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:10,210
your consideration and discussion IP UDP

1377
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:12,800
encapsulation direct identifiers MPLS

1378
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:18,920
generic associated channel header and

1379
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:19,730
Geneva so okay let's start with IP well

1380
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:24,250
understood

1381
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:27,369
we have genève header obviously there is

1382
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:32,090
transport encapsulation above Geneva and

1383
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:35,559
after Geneva the next protocol points

1384
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:38,119
the protocol type points to ipv4 or ipv6

1385
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,280
since we are using either types this

1386
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:46,519
already the these are readily available

1387
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:49,790
and after the genève header we have

1388
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:51,710
inner IP or v6 header and the

1389
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:55,159
destination IP address

1390
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:59,090
it's either so it's one of the martian

1391
01:18:55,159 --> 01:19:04,009
addresses and the multiplexing is based

1392
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:08,510
on destination UDP port usually active

1393
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:12,380
om uses UDP and already assigned UDP

1394
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:13,329
port numbers and maintained in AML

1395
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:18,020
registry

1396
01:19:13,329 --> 01:19:21,469
okay so that's pretty simple it's well

1397
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:25,760
understood it's well known method for

1398
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:26,179
example and OS LSP tunnels but the

1399
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,869
problem

1400
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:33,229
is that it adds up on IP UDP overhead

1401
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:36,380
and as was mentioned in a discussion in

1402
01:19:33,229 --> 01:19:41,229
Prague it potentially creates a

1403
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:44,079
possibility of generating false negative

1404
01:19:41,229 --> 01:19:48,559
if something wrong with the IP UDP

1405
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:54,308
encapsulation because the distances are

1406
01:19:48,559 --> 01:20:00,199
there om packet from the genève header

1407
01:19:54,309 --> 01:20:06,199
direct encapsulation so the protocol

1408
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:11,449
type is active or a.m. type for each of

1409
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:15,138
protocols and then following their

1410
01:20:11,449 --> 01:20:20,900
genève header you have your control

1411
01:20:15,139 --> 01:20:24,320
message no overhead but then because the

1412
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:28,039
probe likely will be multiplicity of

1413
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:31,179
protocols for example echo request reply

1414
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:38,599
BFD performance measurement protocol

1415
01:20:31,179 --> 01:20:41,329
there could be some coordination for

1416
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:43,999
protection switchover or anything else

1417
01:20:41,329 --> 01:20:49,249
that each of protocols who require its

1418
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:57,559
own type assignment MPLS generic

1419
01:20:49,249 --> 01:21:04,719
associated channel so it will use MPOs

1420
01:20:57,559 --> 01:21:04,719
protocol type and then after there

1421
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:12,249
genève header will follow

1422
01:21:08,269 --> 01:21:15,499
gell generic associated level label and

1423
01:21:12,249 --> 01:21:19,670
it will be marked as bottom of the stack

1424
01:21:15,499 --> 01:21:21,829
so it will be only one label and that

1425
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:24,079
will be followed by generic

1426
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:25,909
associational header which is very

1427
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:29,449
similar with the well-known and pseudo

1428
01:21:25,909 --> 01:21:33,170
wire associated channel header and we

1429
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:35,360
can in we use the channel types that

1430
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:39,980
already maintained in Ayana registered

1431
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:45,620
to the wire associated SCH

1432
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:51,280
- types and followed by the body of

1433
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:55,360
their active protocol message so

1434
01:21:51,280 --> 01:22:01,040
positive we reuse to the wirele CCV

1435
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:03,469
method or with gal and we don't need to

1436
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:06,860
define new protocols because pretty much

1437
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:09,470
everything is already defined for to the

1438
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:12,969
wire Mississippi so just a question by

1439
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:16,670
using a gal here rather than the other

1440
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:20,720
because the obit is not defined obit is

1441
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:24,050
not clear where the OEM is is it om in

1442
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:28,100
extensions or om in a payload here is a

1443
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:31,160
clear protocol type and then we go in

1444
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:34,610
the protocol and the protocol just then

1445
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:35,530
we go it's in PL s we look past the

1446
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:39,710
header

1447
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:42,740
it tells MPLS we go we look this is Gail

1448
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:45,830
we know that Gail means it's a ACH or

1449
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:48,980
gas and then we'll go there so we don't

1450
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:50,840
need a bit here everything is straight

1451
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:54,790
forward without oil now having a

1452
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,790
question is should I be better defined I

1453
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,780
mean it seems to me that you've got

1454
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,590
three potential yes I was pointing

1455
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:03,440
abstraction

1456
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:06,170
yes I was pointing that all the way for

1457
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:09,040
discussion of Geneva encapsulation and I

1458
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:12,910
was of opinion that we don't need of it

1459
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:17,570
or at least we don't need a beat for

1460
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:22,340
identifying or am case at least I am

1461
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:25,519
active or am we don't need of it if

1462
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:28,250
somebody wants to use all be to identify

1463
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:31,730
the presence of OM information and

1464
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:37,760
extensions of course but for active Oh

1465
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:42,000
am I don't see the reason we have

1466
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:45,910
protocol type that's efficient

1467
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,520
this precaution from Cisco was how it's

1468
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:51,460
different the existing that I knew

1469
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:54,490
you're three om draft it was a year

1470
01:23:51,460 --> 01:24:05,850
draft also for business

1471
01:23:54,490 --> 01:24:09,370
I don't recall the India draft om it was

1472
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:16,000
channel was used with the eighty nine

1473
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:20,370
zero to be threatened if you can show me

1474
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,560
the link or make certain because again

1475
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:29,349
similar information is engineers BFD

1476
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:31,330
draft yes because Tuco offers discussed

1477
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:34,570
it and put it there but then we decided

1478
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:38,080
to extract it and first discuss this but

1479
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:42,400
I don't know frankly draft I'm not

1480
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:44,740
familiar with the draft it here yeah

1481
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,780
just if you can find the draft and send

1482
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:49,710
it to the list

1483
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:53,019
thank you okay and and the worst is

1484
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:56,740
Geneva associated channel then we need

1485
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:58,990
to define om protocol type so it's

1486
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:02,380
either net but if we can you reuse

1487
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:07,330
existing either type for om it's already

1488
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:12,370
there and then we don't need a gal we

1489
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:17,200
can reuse format similar to to the wire

1490
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:22,390
VCC V reuse the channel types and active

1491
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:27,160
om so there is minimum overhead of just

1492
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:31,660
a ch4 octet and actually we don't need

1493
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:37,330
to create new registry we already have

1494
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:41,500
all types in so which code 20 which if

1495
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:42,370
the type reusing yeah there's a generic

1496
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:47,470
hermano

1497
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:50,200
yeah the same that 1731 is using but

1498
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:54,120
it's not 1731 lesser so no no right but

1499
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:54,120
we're using the same either type

1500
01:25:54,139 --> 01:26:08,849
yes okay sure yeah okay so that's what

1501
01:26:06,599 --> 01:26:12,420
we're proposing and we appreciate the

1502
01:26:08,849 --> 01:26:16,409
discussion your consideration and what

1503
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:18,989
we would like to ask Cheers is to put a

1504
01:26:16,409 --> 01:26:21,719
time limit on the discussion so

1505
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:26,249
basically to put the terms of when we

1506
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:28,050
want to arrive to conclusion so

1507
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:30,449
specifically it's a question which of

1508
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:32,159
the encapsulation yes we need to select

1509
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:35,219
one encapsulation

1510
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:41,280
we don't need multiple because that will

1511
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:43,860
be painful for everyone so on this one

1512
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:46,228
on just for my understanding so if the

1513
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:50,670
protocol time is OEM that's the the

1514
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:53,039
aforementioned 89 or to either type that

1515
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:56,099
means the the active OEM packet would be

1516
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:59,400
C of M or what goes into this active OEM

1517
01:26:56,099 --> 01:27:12,630
thingy there no it doesn't have to be

1518
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:15,150
CFM why it has to be CFM I seen it it

1519
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:19,499
can go for example our d FD control

1520
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:21,808
packet give D control packet because it

1521
01:27:19,499 --> 01:27:25,769
will be channel type the channel type

1522
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:29,400
defines what is active or am not

1523
01:27:25,769 --> 01:27:31,559
protocol type defines what active or am

1524
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:35,929
the channel type defines what active or

1525
01:27:31,559 --> 01:27:35,929
MD multiplexing is based on channel type

1526
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:48,090
what do you foresee go in there either

1527
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:51,719
type om right an example what give me an

1528
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:55,289
example of what from your perspective

1529
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:57,119
they're told it's BFD control packets

1530
01:27:55,289 --> 01:27:59,660
for example channel tap have you looked

1531
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:01,849
at the water VC severe

1532
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:05,300
okay so so I think my concern is

1533
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:07,730
overloading the yeah overloading to meet

1534
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:10,510
the meaning of the protocol type o a.m.

1535
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:14,240
if that really means effectively CFM

1536
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:16,970
yeah but we are we using it well but

1537
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:19,969
it's not CFM here it's ACH

1538
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:21,380
yes it's either a decision okay then no

1539
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:27,070
do we need a different do we need an

1540
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:29,900
ephah typefi see yes yeah i star am yeah

1541
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:33,530
okay if it's confusing that we can get

1542
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:35,809
the neither either type but i think that

1543
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:40,070
one option for the genève we can reuse

1544
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:43,730
it because if we if we can use for

1545
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:46,460
example IP over Ethernet as indication

1546
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:51,280
of IP payload then why we cannot use

1547
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:54,230
ethernet om as indication of geneva am i

1548
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:59,090
understand that we are not allocating

1549
01:28:54,230 --> 01:29:03,349
new IP over genève either type or are

1550
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:09,710
waiting my understanding where we're

1551
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:13,670
using IP over Ethernet right so is it

1552
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:18,470
confusing no tom is right so are you

1553
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:22,010
suggesting to use channel type 89 0 - no

1554
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:26,720
no the channel type is it's what's in a

1555
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:30,530
a Jana to the wire ACH registry so it's

1556
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:33,200
a BFD it's all there so and that's it

1557
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:36,190
the multiplexing what I'm suggesting is

1558
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:39,080
to use a protocol type as Ethernet oh um

1559
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:41,660
well so so I think my concern is Harry's

1560
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:46,010
of the extensibility and future if we do

1561
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:50,139
want to run raw CFM over over this then

1562
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:55,010
what you use for the protocol type but

1563
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:58,550
why would we run CFM over genève the CFM

1564
01:29:55,010 --> 01:30:02,060
can be run over service and then it will

1565
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:04,820
be encapsulate in actually that will be

1566
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:08,480
transported as pure data because if it's

1567
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:11,900
end-to-end ethernet om that for genève

1568
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,428
it's a data or in theory but as those

1569
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:15,199
use cases worse

1570
01:30:13,429 --> 01:30:19,130
if M gets run out of all sorts of things

1571
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:21,289
so I just the question of whether or not

1572
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:23,030
it's appropriate to use the protocol

1573
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:27,099
type fields just ICF em there rather

1574
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:31,759
than Geneva REM or something but again

1575
01:30:27,099 --> 01:30:35,809
again to run CFM it will require so much

1576
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:38,090
additional configuration so I really

1577
01:30:35,809 --> 01:30:44,420
don't see the case and why would we do

1578
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:47,809
it for layer three because we understand

1579
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:49,400
that you need to configure maintenance

1580
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:53,239
the main name Nathan's the main

1581
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:58,179
Association so the complexity of running

1582
01:30:53,239 --> 01:31:03,650
layer to OEM when we can run their 3om

1583
01:30:58,179 --> 01:31:06,050
on this tunnel segment right but but the

1584
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:10,579
issue here is ov is it's confusing to

1585
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:12,889
overload a well-recognized code point

1586
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:16,900
for the protocol type okay well if

1587
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:19,309
that's if you take you know a wire shop

1588
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:21,829
snapshot of the packet you might expect

1589
01:31:19,309 --> 01:31:25,849
that if it says CFM in the protocol type

1590
01:31:21,829 --> 01:31:27,499
you're carrying directly CFM III need to

1591
01:31:25,849 --> 01:31:29,510
double check what whether it's really

1592
01:31:27,499 --> 01:31:33,499
interpretation of either type but it's

1593
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:35,329
it's not really a sticking point so if

1594
01:31:33,499 --> 01:31:46,579
that's the problem we can allocate asked

1595
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:51,429
to allocate another either type of the

1596
01:31:46,579 --> 01:31:51,429
technology so it's not that exactly that

1597
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:59,420
thing is that actually if CFM goes over

1598
01:31:56,269 --> 01:32:03,679
tano it goes as data it doesn't go as

1599
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:08,300
CFM okay so then in this encapsulation

1600
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:19,639
it will be Ethernet if Geneva Geneva

1601
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:21,829
will see CFM as Ethernet not as can you

1602
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:24,110
be so kind and send the name of the

1603
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:26,509
draft and it links to the draft because

1604
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:33,139
otherwise I cannot answer you

1605
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:36,050
my question as the protocol type that's

1606
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:40,489
one of the proposals yes but if group

1607
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:47,929
thinks that it's confusing we can look

1608
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:51,129
for allocation of new either type so how

1609
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:54,380
do you want the working group to respond

1610
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:56,389
you have multiple proposals right so how

1611
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:59,020
exactly you would like working group to

1612
01:32:56,389 --> 01:33:02,030
actually around you

1613
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:05,840
well I think that we need to start

1614
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:07,940
eliminating so we need to start

1615
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:12,110
eliminating some options and saying okay

1616
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:14,809
this is not acceptable at all and so

1617
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:17,360
probably will end up what I would like

1618
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:22,550
is first in the first phase of

1619
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:24,799
discussion and that was two options okay

1620
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:28,520
so let's first eliminate two options out

1621
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:34,239
of four and once we get to two options

1622
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:34,239
then we'll have more extended discussion

1623
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:45,230
okay what I will do is I will send a

1624
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:48,199
note and I would expect people to vote

1625
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:52,428
because I think that eliminating two

1626
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:56,719
options doesn't require a real argument

1627
01:33:52,429 --> 01:34:00,100
the technical discussion okay Martin of

1628
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:03,850
a different opinion or has a proposal

1629
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:10,580
simply to say nothing we don't vote

1630
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:13,010
okay okay no warning then any other

1631
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:17,090
format because what I would like to do

1632
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:17,980
is I would like to have to make this

1633
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:23,570
decision

1634
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:25,759
way before meeting in Singapore so I did

1635
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,659
as a stop we need some discussion on

1636
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,489
this on the list

1637
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:29,869
so we can get some consensus on the pros

1638
01:34:28,489 --> 01:34:32,599
and cons of the different different

1639
01:34:29,869 --> 01:34:34,480
approaches okay then let's have a just

1640
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,980
discussion whether you start with that

1641
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:40,190
started discussion and then we'll try to

1642
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:43,580
measure the level of support

1643
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:47,690
but I would probably do it in two rounds

1644
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:51,110
so the first round is with objective to

1645
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:52,040
get to two options and then in the

1646
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:54,170
second round

1647
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:55,430
just get one option yeah let's see how

1648
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:57,170
it goes because we don't have a very

1649
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:59,449
good record of coming to consensus on

1650
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:03,020
online cancellations for anything in mvo

1651
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:05,419
three lists so so we may have to zoom-in

1652
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:09,560
step up to have to go for design and

1653
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:11,930
actually then I would ask Cheers

1654
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:17,239
to decide what the nuclear option will

1655
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:19,070
be because then you you you say if you

1656
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:24,919
don't come to consensus the nuclear

1657
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:26,599
option is this they I think the choice

1658
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,370
would have to decide would have to say

1659
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,140
what the consensus is in in the working

1660
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:31,640
group or pick or get a design team to

1661
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:33,199
come up with a recommendation that we

1662
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:36,080
can then get consensus on in working

1663
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:37,549
group okay well if there's notice if

1664
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,559
there's not in sufficient discussion on

1665
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:47,900
the list I suspect no again a design

1666
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:51,530
team okay and I do have a comment

1667
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:53,059
question on around at the same time what

1668
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:56,239
is the goal of this what we are trying

1669
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:59,210
to achieve here and especially from the

1670
01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:02,150
actual usability perspective Greg you

1671
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:04,340
mentioned about CFM and the complexity

1672
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,989
of that CFM is a technology stack which

1673
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:09,500
is rather well understood in the field

1674
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:11,809
and basically the community uses that

1675
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:13,969
for their two-minute ability purposes

1676
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:16,250
that's rather well-known for trying to

1677
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:19,580
invent something similar but not the

1678
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:21,199
same that probably would not resonate

1679
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:24,019
too well with the community that's just

1680
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:26,059
additional complexity can we run CFM

1681
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:28,400
over this channel and what while we are

1682
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:30,860
happily talking about the fields values

1683
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:34,460
bits and other things what is the

1684
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:37,429
general problem that is being addressed

1685
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:39,949
here what's a deliverable out of that to

1686
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:43,310
provide for different encapsulations and

1687
01:36:39,949 --> 01:36:46,219
channels to carry Oh am not necessarily

1688
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:49,400
knowing what are the problems what that

1689
01:36:46,219 --> 01:36:51,320
OEM solving do we have the requirements

1690
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,009
what is needed for running these types

1691
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,679
of networks Mui

1692
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:58,320
have you on the overall manageability of

1693
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,150
the stacks basically than the old tunnel

1694
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,480
running and the Oh on some form of

1695
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:06,030
underlay how that manager what are the

1696
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:08,129
manageability problems that and I don't

1697
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:10,050
expect an answer from you here this is

1698
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:14,099
basically an open question but do we

1699
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:17,400
have this understanding well we don't

1700
01:37:14,099 --> 01:37:23,340
have it formulated in a document yes

1701
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:27,000
that's the case I would say that at ITF

1702
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:33,000
we do have well-developed and longtime

1703
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:36,420
deployed and tested om stack it's not

1704
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,130
that might be coherent like again CFM

1705
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:42,179
might not be the best example I would

1706
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:43,679
then use 1731 because 1731 combines

1707
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:47,699
fault management and performance

1708
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:51,630
monitoring but we do have a suit of OM

1709
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:56,579
active om tools that are functionally

1710
01:37:51,630 --> 01:38:03,989
match to 1731 so I would not say that we

1711
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:05,969
inventing new OEM protocol know I know

1712
01:38:03,989 --> 01:38:09,199
their relationship but I'm saying they

1713
01:38:05,969 --> 01:38:15,869
functionally CFM is much shorter than

1714
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:17,129
1731 know so no other way I think he mr.

1715
01:38:15,869 --> 01:38:20,070
you you have a good point here because

1716
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:21,690
if I think back to the the OEM protocols

1717
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:26,518
that we defined for those channel types

1718
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:28,980
or that were identified by those channel

1719
01:38:26,519 --> 01:38:31,289
types you listed there a number of them

1720
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:34,138
were originally developed in the context

1721
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:38,070
of an MPLS transport network not so data

1722
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:39,719
center VPN so so there is a question

1723
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,489
here of which of those are actually

1724
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:43,860
applicable in this sort of an

1725
01:38:41,489 --> 01:38:46,799
operational environment again if we look

1726
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:48,570
from the field perspective MPLS OEM is

1727
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,909
another technology stack which is rather

1728
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:52,619
well understood by the community if we

1729
01:38:50,909 --> 01:38:54,570
can take and reuse that that would be

1730
01:38:52,619 --> 01:38:56,429
definitely be a benefit instead of

1731
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:58,170
trying to reinvent something new which

1732
01:38:56,429 --> 01:39:01,050
basically does the same function but in

1733
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:04,880
a different way right but

1734
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:12,030
that's basically if if you look at this

1735
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:16,500
again mpls om stack an IP om stack are

1736
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:20,400
practically identical okay because it

1737
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:24,989
was not developed for MPLS it was

1738
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:28,730
adapted from IP into MPLS or at least

1739
01:39:24,989 --> 01:39:32,848
created look alike for example LSP ping

1740
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:35,308
BFD works the same way as it works in IP

1741
01:39:32,849 --> 01:39:43,860
network it works over in paris OSP

1742
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:46,710
channels tunnels ok so again what we're

1743
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:50,730
discussing here is what the best in

1744
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:54,270
simplest way to make available or a.m.

1745
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:57,110
to set work over genève tunnel there

1746
01:39:54,270 --> 01:40:01,770
there the goal of this discussion is not

1747
01:39:57,110 --> 01:40:04,679
to develop new OEM protocol ah but how

1748
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:06,929
to make existing om tools to work over

1749
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:07,829
genève so i'm very happy by the first

1750
01:40:06,929 --> 01:40:09,540
part of the answer

1751
01:40:07,829 --> 01:40:14,579
please don't invent yet another William

1752
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:16,829
thing because there are plenty I think

1753
01:40:14,579 --> 01:40:18,329
this is definitely for I don't want to

1754
01:40:16,829 --> 01:40:20,040
occupy the time this is definitely for

1755
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:24,558
broader discussion over the broader

1756
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:27,780
community I kind of get the feeling that

1757
01:40:24,559 --> 01:40:31,020
the group does not necessarily see the

1758
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:33,239
clear view of how this can be used what

1759
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:35,460
are the actual requirements maybe that

1760
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:37,468
would be a good starting point to see

1761
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:39,960
what is available and how those things

1762
01:40:37,469 --> 01:40:41,400
are being used basically what are the

1763
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:45,440
problems in these types of the

1764
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:45,440
deployments and how to address those I

1765
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:55,260
agree that actually the requirements for

1766
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:59,879
om functions it's a good document to

1767
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:02,820
produce but I don't see that this

1768
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:06,540
discussion of how we encapsulate active

1769
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:10,469
om and discussion of what we need to do

1770
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:13,290
in active or am I think then they can go

1771
01:41:10,469 --> 01:41:14,410
concurrently in parallel they're not

1772
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:18,300
[Music]

1773
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:22,630
they're not getting each other because

1774
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:22,840
this is not what we do this is how we do

1775
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:33,790
it

1776
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:36,400
what we do is different okay so discuss

1777
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:39,670
decide and then we were planning to do

1778
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:43,089
look at what extensions we need for echo

1779
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:46,900
request reply because continuing on what

1780
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:48,730
Agnes said I do believe that yes this

1781
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:51,389
environment may require certain

1782
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:57,009
extensions to apply functionality

1783
01:41:51,390 --> 01:42:02,230
especially to probe their particular

1784
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:05,640
things okay but so as I understand just

1785
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:09,969
check my understanding verify with you

1786
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:12,370
that I will send the email starting the

1787
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:16,810
discussion you'll be judging the

1788
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:18,160
consensus yeah I think in addition to

1789
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:24,130
this I think Ignis I write a very good

1790
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:27,220
points about the requirements yeah just

1791
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:29,410
just thinking back to some of the I mean

1792
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:30,970
normally which tools you need to use in

1793
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:32,860
a given environment probably shouldn't

1794
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:34,780
dictate the encapsulation but maybe here

1795
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:38,799
it may be here it might influence say

1796
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:41,800
the choice between UDP and and an ACH

1797
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:47,740
okay there's a whole bunch of tools so

1798
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:52,570
actually i i i i have to bring that back

1799
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:55,990
history some time ago we had overlay om

1800
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:59,370
design team and overlay om design team

1801
01:42:55,990 --> 01:43:02,469
came up with their requirements and then

1802
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:09,580
we were told and I was told that oh no

1803
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:10,030
we don't need this document so we have a

1804
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,679
doc

1805
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:16,179
and at least that we can start working

1806
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:18,610
with because it lists requirements I can

1807
01:43:16,179 --> 01:43:21,369
bring it up I can bring it into and vo

1808
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:23,619
group specifically and then the working

1809
01:43:21,369 --> 01:43:25,690
group can start looking and say okay yes

1810
01:43:23,619 --> 01:43:30,329
that's relevant not that's not relevant

1811
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:42,669
and that's missing so would that be a

1812
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:48,219
plan to play game plan this is going

1813
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:53,380
back and forth right yep we have had

1814
01:43:48,219 --> 01:43:57,670
this effort within the routing area yes

1815
01:43:53,380 --> 01:44:00,610
to form the design team well design team

1816
01:43:57,670 --> 01:44:04,480
worked it produced number of documents

1817
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:09,219
and among these documents was pretty

1818
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:11,919
generic pretty generic I admit list of

1819
01:44:09,219 --> 01:44:14,880
requirements we can start it from

1820
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:19,090
scratch or we can start it from the

1821
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:21,940
existing document I don't have the

1822
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:26,219
context of that but at least my

1823
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:30,820
understanding of the outcome was that

1824
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:37,030
there was no consensus on what is to be

1825
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:37,299
done okay then then how will I rest my

1826
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:40,989
case

1827
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:45,989
is the list okay all right thanks Greg

1828
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:45,989
and I think that's it thank you

1829
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:58,949
