1
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,140
yes

2
00:02:05,659 --> 00:03:42,500
I know you know the reason I'm not going

3
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,980
to be opening this because right when is

4
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,790
to open it and give 700 megabytes

5
00:03:44,980 --> 00:04:00,709
compressed and it expands about 5 T sub

6
00:03:49,790 --> 00:04:05,108
points every 5-minute interval one Sun

7
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:08,620
and then I'm going to be you know they

8
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,620
remove the filters

9
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:43,640
the tractor - all right so let's start

10
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,460
then

11
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:54,330
this is ikazuchi me I'd be sick - and

12
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:57,000
minor expenses if you have a minor all

13
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:03,780
right so here's the note though you

14
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:08,040
probably noted already know it's Harry

15
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,349
yeah so we need there are many voters to

16
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,910
take notes like what was one to be naked

17
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm gonna be I'm using etherpad

18
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,860
oops be useful to have somebody else

19
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,620
because Michael you so rush to the mic

20
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:25,160
if not I can I can try to do something

21
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,960
others do we need the dumber scribe

22
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:43,770
okay right you're already sitting in the

23
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:45,599
place alright so here's an agenda that

24
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,760
we have anything that people have

25
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,650
changed you have a status report we have

26
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,880
a I tell you how about a percentage we

27
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,390
are going to be have a very short

28
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,680
procedure

29
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,030
you know announcement in there actually

30
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,570
actually after absolutely for the

31
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,169
ridiculous report and know me so nobody

32
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:09,719
know how did it go sorry it took me out

33
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:11,250
to find a microphone it's it's not a

34
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,150
wireless on either so I can't take it to

35
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,950
the middle of the room

36
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,669
so all the speakers has to be here okay

37
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,020
hi I'm Paula artist I just wanted for

38
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,180
our gender bashing

39
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,430
everybody seemed to forgotten about the

40
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,250
graveyard draft and maybe we should

41
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,530
spend one minute on that and see what we

42
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,270
need to remember it but the

43
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,849
we realize those of the outbursts

44
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:36,130
doesn't push it the other people own

45
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,130
okay so we're ready for a coupe adoption

46
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,669
rookie season code if you have only one

47
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,760
all right so yeah it's the graveyard

48
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,960
stuff if there are I think they were

49
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,340
supposed to be starting up some

50
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,200
discussion about the truth you know

51
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,640
mainly a steady but there's a couple of

52
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,490
butter trucks about safety

53
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,020
there was every Ross family agreed to

54
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,960
start some discussion is very mailing

55
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,650
list intently on do them and nothing

56
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,450
happened so if you want to be the

57
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,679
proctor for Aria you should cut

58
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:27,409
discussing alright so so the breaking up

59
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,630
starters we have an implicit I need it's

60
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,880
already publication request it has been

61
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,890
there for some time I have no idea when

62
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,810
it's going to be coming forward

63
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,770
hopefully soon I think the ad say that

64
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:43,640
he has some other issues and he is he

65
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,859
now has a cup of my craft in front of

66
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,550
these i pitcher can be dropped and then

67
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:52,120
perhaps couple of weeks or salsa so and

68
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,070
say mister first went to the preset keys

69
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,050
so hopefully they get an idea but last

70
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,300
fall and because we realize that it's

71
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:04,070
not our original fourth we actually work

72
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:08,210
and must done even if we have submitted

73
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,800
them to is geez alright Chris would from

74
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,750
a PO I just was asked to come here and

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,500
comment that we are shipping a version

76
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,430
of the implicit IP drafts in iOS 13 so

77
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,330
perhaps that will help move it along

78
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,710
alright that we have been working

79
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,240
working processing this ipv4 and ipv6

80
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,020
coexistence status notification draft

81
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,580
and I think it's this should be ready

82
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,000
for working tomorrow I think we are

83
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:40,208
going to be a large ball out immediately

84
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,208
after during machining have ordering

85
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:46,090
all right so and so here are someone

86
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,970
scopes

87
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:52,030
so we already marked those into Civ IV

88
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,070
and if you are I question - that's done

89
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,600
even if they no idea plus course it's

90
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,110
done because it's it's already pushed

91
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,480
given to their ad and they then go

92
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,310
forward when tada we already behind on

93
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,790
other things as you see

94
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,530
and I think about should we actually we

95
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,140
are trying to get you know these at

96
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,449
least you know internal addresses

97
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,270
favoring the cases as fast as possible -

98
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,990
and then and also the Chito I don't know

99
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,319
about the others

100
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,790
how this would be are there is hasn't

101
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,650
been anything happening in bringing the

102
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,150
ESPN concert network shot there hasn't

103
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,380
been happening anything into signature

104
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,180
for it negotiation

105
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,510
I don't know they are gonna have a truck

106
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,280
for that but don't think so we don't and

107
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:39,310
outer or who was supposed to writing

108
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:41,470
these checks to remember exactly what

109
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,920
what encrypted documentation probably

110
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,590
our city well you know forward even even

111
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,949
if it's actually is the last one

112
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,610
and they labeled security level stuff

113
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:57,930
let's see what happens if that and then

114
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,930
I think we have some announcements

115
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:10,689
Stanislas mishnev so we have an ongoing

116
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:13,149
process of back selection protocol in

117
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:17,610
say for jealousy and most of us most of

118
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:20,110
you know about this and we have two

119
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:24,009
difficult questions that we need to

120
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,769
consider its integration in a couple of

121
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:29,350
protocols in IP to an interlaced intra

122
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:34,480
handshake so there will be a call for

123
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:39,610
experts to have some independent reviews

124
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:45,699
for integration of each candidate packs

125
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:51,910
into IP second into LS so we'd be happy

126
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:56,319
if people in IPSec working group would

127
00:10:51,910 --> 00:11:00,579
be able to find some time and to make

128
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:05,680
reviews of nominated protocols or

129
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:09,638
Guardians IPSec I know that Larry may be

130
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,370
stated that we say besides our less

131
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,680
problems we will have is telling us if

132
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:19,029
to go if to think about the rest of

133
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:22,239
packs but in any case expert reviews

134
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:28,089
from guys in a sec working group will be

135
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:31,779
really desired for safer G to make the

136
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:38,829
recommendations for one or two packs or

137
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:40,029
0px so if you are able to come to safer

138
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:43,000
G session on Thursday

139
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,300
please come and maybe respond to the

140
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,040
call for experts or otherwise just come

141
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,349
to me or Alexei Melnikov for Kenny

142
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,089
Patterson or Nick Sullivan and say that

143
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,800
you are ready to do some kind of work

144
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:59,410
Thank You magic whatever is my slope for

145
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,870
this bus and I just want to remind all

146
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,100
of you that you probably know that there

147
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:10,240
is a framework for integration pake and

148
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:13,420
as I remember correctly is surgery 64 67

149
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,160
not widely used but is it exists for

150
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,770
acquittal and so probably

151
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:24,140
it's time to push it to move it forward

152
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:27,230
currently it's an experimental ever seen

153
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:34,150
I'll assume it was written by Tara I

154
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:39,080
think it's my life again so of course if

155
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:41,030
the ideas of experts from the point a

156
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,420
psycho episode will be that all pecks

157
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:47,030
are good because as a framework it work

158
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,099
will be okay but I believe that there

159
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:52,959
will be a lot of issues and a lot of

160
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:56,270
preferences of for example balance tax

161
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,110
in contrast to our bundle packs so I

162
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:31,790
think that some issues will occur so

163
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:35,390
please try to find some time hello again

164
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:40,339
it's update unlike to mediate exchange

165
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:44,720
and it's just the first lie to review

166
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,940
over you if you forget what it is about

167
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,630
so it's an exchange to take place

168
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:54,860
between like I say Anita nycos and it's

169
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,720
mine purpose is to allow like to

170
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:02,180
exchange some data probably light data

171
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,250
before the I take place and take

172
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,459
advantage of reason most like

173
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:10,370
fragmentation not necessarily but it's

174
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,540
it was a mine it's mine goal was my

175
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:19,310
purpose and from previous version

176
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:22,760
what is changed first the exchange is

177
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:25,520
once again renamed this time - I can't

178
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,860
omit it I think everyone is more or less

179
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,960
kept innocence

180
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,960
we don't need another round

181
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:48,730
I added some consideration for

182
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:51,580
integration with our assumption that it

183
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,720
is not resumed there's no point

184
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:58,630
resuming this exchange because it's just

185
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:03,640
used mostly between I Cassini tonight

186
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:06,250
both and after your assume it's no point

187
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:17,160
to have it but anyway it can be

188
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:20,350
renegotiated well to be fair the

189
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,569
immediate is for unknown things in the

190
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,820
future that might be big so whether or

191
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,770
not it's needed it's not something you

192
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,960
can say right now yes but you can

193
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:34,960
renegotiate it by doing the assumption

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:37,030
so if both sides things that it is they

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,340
will use it for some other purposes

196
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:41,280
while doing the assumption I guess their

197
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,630
assumptions they both will send

198
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,660
intermediate to say support it and they

199
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,640
can use it for example between I guess I

200
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,610
could say resume when I call somebody

201
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,360
places oh I see okay I understand things

202
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:58,080
so the I just want to say is it it is

203
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,850
not stored in the resumption ticket

204
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:08,050
whether they support it or not whether

205
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:10,270
it is needed or not so so next and a few

206
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,949
words about authentication of I get

207
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:17,350
immediate exchanges the complex topics

208
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:18,820
it has been changed a few times and this

209
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:24,190
just an overview how it is done

210
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:26,020
currently and a few days a few about a

211
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,110
week ago I have a conversation with one

212
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,240
of a pair of implementers of I can't

213
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,790
immediately implement and this exchange

214
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,060
and he complains that there are some

215
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,030
issues with perform an authentication of

216
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,518
a community because it's very unusual

217
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,449
and

218
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:50,160
first he complains that it is not well

219
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,140
this is just description of how it is

220
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,279
done currently so the purpose of

221
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:58,019
syndication the the internal content of

222
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:03,570
a contaminant message message before

223
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:06,359
encryption is fit into PRF and this

224
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:11,480
peripheral will later fit into echos

225
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:13,619
calculation and this scheme allows to I

226
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,480
contributed to be fully compliant with

227
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:21,119
our seasoned 73 83 is it allows sending

228
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,620
resent in fragmented packet one you will

229
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,438
receive no reply from unfragmented

230
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,119
packets so the content the unencrypted

231
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,840
content will be the same so in this case

232
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,239
I caused one break when you first sent

233
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,320
and fragmented packet design fragmented

234
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:42,480
so it's a reason why the scheme was

235
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,450
selected and currently the input

236
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,760
includes our concern if you send a

237
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,100
fragment attack packet you should

238
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,580
reconstruct as if it is sent

239
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,550
unfragmented for the HEDIS to him as he

240
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,610
does aikido and encryption ecology they

241
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:03,168
have the same well as if it is sent

242
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,729
unfragmented and the problem is that as

243
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,590
this guy told me that it is very

244
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,360
unconvenient for some implementation

245
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:14,879
highly motile imitation because at the

246
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,459
point that they compute PRF they don't

247
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,679
know the size of 5 e IC v the size of

248
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:24,470
padding because it is in the different

249
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:28,830
orders it all these values are known and

250
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:32,070
another issues that has been discovered

251
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,639
by our conversation is that if peers

252
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:44,399
select a different policy for reading

253
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:47,370
then the receiver may run into station

254
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,910
when the authentication will fail even

255
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,250
if the message isn't tampered with so

256
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,740
the solutions that I have in mind it is

257
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,550
not yet

258
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:03,730
published in my local editor scorpion is

259
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:05,919
to get rid of all the scripture lengths

260
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,420
staff lenses IV lengths of I see

261
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,920
violence of badlands

262
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:15,059
the subtract them from remove them from

263
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,890
the lens field in the IP header and

264
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:21,790
encrypted pellet heater so that the lens

265
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,260
that will be the length of the data that

266
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,659
will be felt in the peripheral by

267
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,320
exactly that the data to be fed in the

268
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,330
paraffin nice and more so well I'm going

269
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,950
to publish that submission Windows is

270
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,750
now open I'm going to publish the draft

271
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:42,390
today tomorrow I don't know when I have

272
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:45,370
time to do it please review it and I

273
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:49,929
don't think it's a big change

274
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:54,100
it's it makes it seems clear for

275
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:56,670
authentication it removes its concern at

276
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,709
least it makes easier for highly modular

277
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,400
implementation to do authentication if I

278
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:06,160
could to me that I told I proposed this

279
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,890
scheme to these a guy and he says that

280
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,640
he can live with it it will ease him his

281
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:17,679
way his life

282
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:20,020
substantially so well after I publish

283
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,760
its draft we will discuss us and we can

284
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,770
discuss it on the list but otherwise I

285
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,650
think that the draft is more or less

286
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,030
stable and there are at least I send all

287
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,900
three implementations it's mine

288
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,540
implementations

289
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,610
tubber's and the guys that is

290
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,290
concurrently from one of the major

291
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,959
vendors that is currently implementing

292
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,960
it so it's wrong

293
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,390
so you're now going to make a new

294
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,220
version of that draft with or without

295
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,990
first proposed it to said them you know

296
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,390
description of the list and before you

297
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,049
start making changes crops which are

298
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,970
your plan

299
00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:07,320
I can I can I can just publish the

300
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:09,900
traffic described as changes actually

301
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:16,168
the text Israeli and I need to review it

302
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:19,669
it's probably take me there - yeah even

303
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:44,299
before I did before was meeting lens no

304
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:47,429
idea one two five okay so last time we

305
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:49,379
talked about the the problem of the

306
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:52,559
security level as we had it at the time

307
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,559
it was we combined it with the v4 or v6

308
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,320
address range into a specific selector

309
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:00,330
and I managed to convince y'all that I

310
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,909
wasn't the best way so we so basically

311
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,370
done back to the previous version of the

312
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,040
format so so I put that in here so this

313
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:12,389
is basically what it is is just a no pig

314
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:15,149
blow up it has a length and that's it so

315
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:18,809
the changes I made in the in the last

316
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,280
revision I cut out a lot of writing we

317
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:22,230
did about explaining how traffic's like

318
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:28,770
this work and expect you to just VAR c

319
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:31,110
72 96 we split I yeah we split the the

320
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,379
parts where we because the we're

321
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,149
updating the core are likely to RFC on

322
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,919
what to do with traffic selectors so I

323
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,809
wanted to make it much much more clear

324
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,190
that you know this is about updating

325
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,110
that

326
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,090
the traffic selector handling in general

327
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,990
and this is the update for the specific

328
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,179
security label traffic selector and

329
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,280
animate some some minor changes allow

330
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,560
multiple security labels just in case

331
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,980
there are some other security system

332
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:02,550
that would allow that be explicit not

333
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:06,120
allowing zero-length clarifying the

334
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:08,159
handling of multiple of one TS coming oh

335
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,469
yeah yeah so the so make sure like like

336
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,060
it could be that that two security

337
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,340
labels are a lot and that the other end

338
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,960
can choose I don't know what security

339
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,939
systems people are gonna use this with

340
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,580
so I want to make sure that that was

341
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,750
obvious and then because they are now

342
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,310
multiple types of traffic selectors I

343
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,530
clarified that you must at least pick an

344
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:31,379
ipv4 address range ID 56 address range

345
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,490
because the the core RFC didn't say that

346
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,280
because there was the only ones you

347
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,080
could pick and then I made some editing

348
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,660
errors and and there's still some craft

349
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:45,679
that I need to remove and that is

350
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,680
basically it I think so any questions

351
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:57,060
well it is before this plus pole I have

352
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,680
read your draft very quickly but I am

353
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,800
very much concerned that you have

354
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:05,670
changed the rules the basic I could do

355
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:10,379
rules for narrow in traffic selectors

356
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:16,460
because if I get your right it is no

357
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,460
more possible to negotiate a list of

358
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:28,169
intervals IP intervals so you from from

359
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:33,380
from Cavalera to draft you requires that

360
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:38,730
responders let exactly one traffic slit

361
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:41,100
sub structure of type IP for pb6

362
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:46,680
and not multiple of it do I get it right

363
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:49,949
not yeah but that's in a unity SIDS are

364
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:53,490
you you don't have both right

365
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,390
no no I I knew that currently I in the

366
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:59,100
shot okay

367
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:03,600
propose a list of the sub structure and

368
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:07,080
respond again except the least so you'll

369
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,590
have not a single subnet for example but

370
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:15,120
at least of subnets that are covered by

371
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:18,720
one IP circus a and if I get a draft rat

372
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:24,120
frankly I read it very quickly you know

373
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,970
more support this feature because he

374
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,179
requires that among the list of for

375
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:33,630
example TS type IP before a sponsor must

376
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:38,600
select exactly one sub structure so you

377
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:44,160
can't negotiate an IPC phase that has a

378
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:46,679
disjoint list of subnets covered by I by

379
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,040
a single IP circuses it is allowed by a

380
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:54,090
pigeon so is it true if it's true I

381
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,409
think that it's so let me just repeat

382
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,879
what I think you're saying because I'm

383
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,360
still not entirely sure I understand it

384
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,050
okay

385
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,949
you're saying the initiator could send

386
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:07,950
something with a v4 and v6 is type and

387
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:12,900
then even before but several before

388
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,800
types you know to subnets to subnets

389
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,840
agnostic and the majesty and the

390
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,909
responder can actually fly to summits oh

391
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,970
yeah yeah source any kind of you know

392
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:27,120
subset of them but then you are

393
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,220
removable ipv4 subset submits returns

394
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,560
yeah Condor and that's a lot of it I

395
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,040
person to an already say that your

396
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,379
processes you already done so Pontius

397
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,870
people okay that is an intentional done

398
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,470
okay I will fix that okay now I did not

399
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:51,330
mean to do that

400
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:53,670
okay thank you so what's your timeline I

401
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,500
will immediately fix this and this week

402
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:00,290
it will go out put a new version new

403
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:05,090
revision this would be quite ready for

404
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,090
school yeah I think so

405
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:17,379
you don't seem to think so with your

406
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:36,220
chair so it's up to you next one we have

407
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:37,679
then is that cookie management so hello

408
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,600
again

409
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,270
basically it's well just a disclaimer

410
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,209
basically it's almost the same

411
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:51,850
presentation as Brian did a few ATF's

412
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:59,549
ago it just updated a little bit and so

413
00:27:51,850 --> 00:28:08,709
the topic is quite old and well beaten

414
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:11,020
so it's the idea is to have an ability

415
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:15,330
for a pitcher to protect multicast

416
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:18,400
traffic so there is a long history of

417
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:23,678
quite long history of this activity in

418
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:26,320
ITF started in 2001 two thousand fifty

419
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,400
thousand eleven it was an SEC working

420
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,020
groves they produced some documents and

421
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,370
all these documents is the problem

422
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,790
resolves this documents the current

423
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:40,030
problem is that the key management is

424
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:43,600
based on Ike live on and that is already

425
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:51,059
duplicated some people you want to kill

426
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:57,100
it absolutely all to have a grave yet so

427
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:59,080
and if we want to define a key

428
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,740
management protocol for multicast and

429
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:07,320
based on Ike we - as the current key

430
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,590
management the folk for unicast so

431
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,330
multicast

432
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:15,459
creation well let's just assume you know

433
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,830
everything what is written about just

434
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:22,600
reminds that there is at least one

435
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:24,460
Center and multiple receivers and the

436
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,510
packet I wrote it well a multicast

437
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:33,510
routing so that each receiver receives

438
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:39,129
exactly the one copy of the IP packet

439
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:42,039
and you don't need to have a lot of all

440
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:49,270
this is protected by a single IP circusy

441
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:52,450
and this requires peers of the group to

442
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:56,879
share the same keys so the keys are not

443
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:59,649
negotiated but distributed by a central

444
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:05,080
group control key servers who distribute

445
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:08,529
gifts to all group members using is a

446
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:15,158
multicast or unicast security

447
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:20,010
Association so there are two two main

448
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:22,570
phases of the jak2 first phase is

449
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:30,490
registration when group member want to

450
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:32,918
join a group he starts doing I wish I

451
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,679
could say in it it's classical I guess I

452
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:41,190
need a followed by a new exchange that's

453
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,539
called GSA out earth and in GSA oath

454
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:48,279
indicates which group he is going to

455
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:50,890
join and if he is allowed group control

456
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:54,460
key server sends back a keys for

457
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,980
decryption well SP eyes and the keys

458
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:00,399
needed for the crypt in these sales

459
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,580
protect this group so and it's an

460
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,260
initial registrations articular

461
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:09,399
subsequently registrations can be done

462
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:12,419
more easily where one round-trip

463
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:16,729
exchange sa registration if you want if

464
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:20,510
group member want to join was in one row

465
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:23,049
and the other important part of the

466
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:28,250
circuit section is our key particle

467
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:29,418
there are two different type of her keys

468
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,240
that are supported

469
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:35,559
first is multicast turkey where our key

470
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,679
is done where the same not the same but

471
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,750
over a multicast messaging messages it's

472
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,250
something like I quit emoticons to say

473
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:48,650
so it is like I quit two essay but

474
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,760
distributed or multicast it's you know

475
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:56,090
it is one direction from God control to

476
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,190
key server as the other there's a way of

477
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,889
routine is just where unicast that

478
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,100
initial unicast says it broke member

479
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:08,200
created when he registered to the group

480
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:11,629
if this say is kept it can be used to

481
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:17,360
periodically change keys for small

482
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:21,020
groups of course so we'll go back slide

483
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,799
yeah schwa is the multicast wiki

484
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:28,160
actually signed by the initiator it is

485
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:34,700
no only group it is initiated but go

486
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:38,090
control server it is signed it's a sign

487
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:47,990
you can see all pollute and out pollute

488
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:49,100
is yes and so it is it can be a well if

489
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:53,570
there is a drop there are two

490
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:58,399
possibilities you can omit this oath

491
00:32:53,570 --> 00:33:01,820
pollute in this case it will directly

492
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,270
authenticated by providing by by by

493
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:11,000
heaven the ability to decrypt it and

494
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:13,070
take a and verify I CV but of course it

495
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,740
means that it is a shared key Center

496
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:18,470
cages so there is no originals education

497
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,799
yes it's for small very trusted groups

498
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,799
and

499
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:28,899
more more proper authentication is to

500
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,809
include this hours below it is computed

501
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:34,779
using signature digital signature with

502
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,029
the public is that in initial exchange

503
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:39,070
loop control until Sarah will distribute

504
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:41,559
and since it is my public key I will

505
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:45,100
sign my messages with private key

506
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:47,649
corresponding to this public key so so a

507
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,019
new pallets are headed to I quit ooh

508
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:53,739
that's GSL pillows that contains a

509
00:33:50,019 --> 00:34:00,279
policy so it's algorithms that will be

510
00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:02,200
protect multicast assay and its traffic

511
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,889
encryption is a policy for traffic

512
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:11,349
encryption for key encryption and some

513
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:13,839
other policy is not related to traffic

514
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:17,950
decryption key encryption it's just for

515
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:21,270
some very generic things that can be

516
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:28,540
also distributed to group members and

517
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:31,780
the other new Pilates Pilates contain a

518
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,719
keys key and distributing the load as it

519
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,470
contains keys for traffic encryption

520
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,158
keys

521
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:42,339
King Krypton keys lkh it illogical

522
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,440
illogical key Archie it's very

523
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:47,859
interesting it's quite interesting idea

524
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,450
when you have well if I won't spec my

525
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:52,328
time a lot of time

526
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:58,328
it's an idea when you have when you can

527
00:34:52,329 --> 00:35:01,839
actually change a key so that everybody

528
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:03,700
good knee got a new key except for the

529
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,328
users that you want to drop from the

530
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:13,960
group where a multicast virological keys

531
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:16,810
well and sender ID and for it is some

532
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,339
prefix for account based algorithm so

533
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:25,150
that if there are multiple senders they

534
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:27,220
the counters don't overlap because

535
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,440
otherwise it's a in counter mode

536
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,740
encryption its disaster if they overlap

537
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,670
so each sender receives its own prefix

538
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:39,560
for

539
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:43,700
counter for for maintenance for counter

540
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:47,420
algorithm so and you some sample loads

541
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,210
are reused from I co2 is like a

542
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,610
different meaning its IDG blood that

543
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:56,200
indicates a group that is members going

544
00:35:52,610 --> 00:36:01,220
to join and well

545
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:04,490
asaji well actually I DG is below that

546
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:09,399
is similar a mistake it is similar to ID

547
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:12,259
but with restricted set of ID types and

548
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,510
as a cheaper load is similar to a safer

549
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,300
load but it indicates which algorithm

550
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,700
group member support so that a group

551
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,770
control like a seller can select

552
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,350
algorithm proper before for all member

553
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:28,210
for all members of the group so it's all

554
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:31,190
can she is ensures that all can decrypt

555
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,100
traffic the authorities also have

556
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,980
slightly changed semantics because as

557
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:41,690
allow us to delete the whole multicast

558
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:44,030
to say well there are also Union and new

559
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,120
notifications compared to a cui to it's

560
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:49,250
invalid group ID authorization failed

561
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,049
when group member is not authorized to

562
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,750
join the group registration penalties

563
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:56,240
for any other reason registration cannot

564
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:00,080
happen and start a scientifically

565
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:03,200
centers that is sent by group member

566
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,730
when it indicates that he is going to

567
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:12,439
sign charge it because generally Sanders

568
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:14,540
have must be treated differently from

569
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,120
receivers because Sanders must receive

570
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,360
sender ID for counter based algorithm so

571
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,819
the group controlling key server must

572
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:27,750
pay attention for those who are going to

573
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:31,140
send so draft

574
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:34,260
his life for we're a long time very very

575
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:36,859
long time and none of original ulcers

576
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:41,210
currently I am own house is leased

577
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:45,540
houses I've been changed a long time and

578
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:48,000
there are few implementations very few

579
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,740
one full of limitation but the older

580
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,069
versions of the draft not the current

581
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:55,950
version and a couple of partial

582
00:37:53,069 --> 00:38:00,329
implementation including minimum I quit

583
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:01,950
- gee I quit oh well recently the last

584
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:07,310
version of the drafters it quite a lot

585
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:12,750
of changes so before the evolution was

586
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:14,430
quite slow but recently we have a large

587
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,339
step forward

588
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:21,899
so we think as the ocean who thinks that

589
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:27,390
the draft can be considered as a

590
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:32,369
starting point for IPSec of each art

591
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:36,060
item so we ask for adoption for review

592
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:48,210
and for adoption of the draft so thank

593
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:50,009
you some people who would get this done

594
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,770
one of the user for this would probably

595
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,710
be you know a triple a fifteen point

596
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:59,599
nine major or a provision that is

597
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:02,280
starting now if they there is need to

598
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,579
distribute broadcast and multicast piece

599
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,079
inside I could say

600
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:12,210
inside a mic so one of things actually

601
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:15,690
was bigger but you see this so any

602
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:17,819
comments I think the properties the

603
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:25,800
traffic do you think the truck is ready

604
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:29,369
for us code or perhaps production how

605
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,880
many in the room have read the draft by

606
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,880
show of hands

607
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,980
Michael Richardson here so I scanned it

608
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,619
through and I remember reading part of

609
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,210
it while I was a little bit surprised X

610
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,849
I was trying to figure out why the

611
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,190
document has the name Cy Young wit

612
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,930
that's not one of the authors and then I

613
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,549
discovered the list of authors at the

614
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,160
end with their addresses which is a bit

615
00:39:54,549 --> 00:40:00,099
unusual to have their full addresses as

616
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,359
contributors just as a surprise but I

617
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:04,089
understand what's happened

618
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,950
but given that those four people who are

619
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:07,779
critical to the creation of the doc and

620
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:12,250
don't seem to be participating right now

621
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:15,849
and I think that the mutant group were

622
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:18,099
at IETF one Oh what is last one through

623
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,359
four foreign prog right there from

624
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:23,140
University of motion

625
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,720
are they still active at this point what

626
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,210
I'm concerned about is that that that

627
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,520
these people none of us are doing

628
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,260
multicast and well we may think it's

629
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,420
very interesting and we can criticize

630
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,880
the format of you're off payload or

631
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,900
something we may not really understand

632
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,440
things I'm really concerned about

633
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:44,250
ability to get the multicast side of the

634
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,430
review done right in this working group

635
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:51,309
because I think you have enough IP to

636
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,649
expertise to make up for any of our

637
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:57,760
locking but I'm not sure that we have

638
00:40:53,650 --> 00:41:01,510
enough multicast to help does that make

639
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,279
sense my question really is that how

640
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,890
much of the multi-car stuff is changed

641
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:08,049
since then you know Justin or still

642
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,680
outsource out to your button who do you

643
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,619
see there

644
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,038
and and how are you going to get those

645
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:17,020
implementations interoperating and doing

646
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:21,000
things that's what I'm kind of concerned

647
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,000
that this is almost an academic exercise

648
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,660
the basic stuff is still saying it

649
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,129
hasn't been changed to do to change it's

650
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:35,618
really changing you know I questioned

651
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:37,569
one form on - I get that but but I'm

652
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:39,760
still concerned that that that those

653
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:41,200
people are that those people who are

654
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,750
going to use it or not being involved

655
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,430
are not really involved that's what I'm

656
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,650
concerned but maybe there's a whole

657
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,560
bunch of I Triple E if he not

658
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,780
t9 or whatever people that will review

659
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,360
it for us I don't know I'm just that's

660
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,310
what I'm concerned me yeah I know that's

661
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:02,290
what I know hoping it was like hundred

662
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:05,140
people behind you right now last meeting

663
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,509
I was the first 15 minutes I was the

664
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,279
only person that drew I know because I

665
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,350
was sharing it and then there came to

666
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,710
two other people looking for me but not

667
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,710
for that reason

668
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:21,670
I just want to remind that Brian who is

669
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:25,330
Taylor calls was a close in chair for

670
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:29,410
Jidori I'm SEC working group so listen

671
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:32,620
he has some experience in multicast

672
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:34,839
because he was chairing that group when

673
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:40,020
it was acting right good for a great one

674
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:56,230
so I hope there are some people who

675
00:42:40,020 --> 00:43:09,490
understand that stuff and see what goes

676
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:12,040
on so the next presentation is top of

677
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,459
the burner items it's um it's up here we

678
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,350
have a charter already and then we start

679
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,710
going these other presentations which

680
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,690
are in the process of grasping on the

681
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:26,950
charger item something so let's start

682
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:28,990
with the first what TT X days again we

683
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:31,680
always put you in every other past but

684
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:44,529
don't you have to chop up and down okay

685
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:48,569
hoping this solo color once more it's an

686
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:52,510
update for quantum resistant I quit too

687
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:57,670
so if you forget what it is all about

688
00:43:52,510 --> 00:44:00,430
it's just an overview so we're all

689
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:06,490
concerned very much concerned about

690
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:13,190
quantum computers and within that hybrid

691
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:16,879
key exchange is the right way to go that

692
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:19,520
combined that will combine classical EC

693
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,030
th with some post quantum methods that

694
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,880
are not very trusted yet so we combined

695
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,680
several of them from different with the

696
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,960
different properties so to be sure is it

697
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:37,129
a combined exchange is secure enough and

698
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:41,720
so the protocol take advantage of fusion

699
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:43,820
I get immediate exchange and in this I

700
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,720
can't immediate exchange an additional

701
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:51,830
key exchanges take place that presume to

702
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,419
be quantum resistant but it is not

703
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:55,160
requirement it's just a framework you

704
00:44:53,420 --> 00:45:00,260
can combine for example several

705
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:03,020
classical exchanges if you want to for

706
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:07,190
some I don't know policy reasons so it

707
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:09,710
is not strictly linked to post quantum

708
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:15,490
well but anyway after each exchange I

709
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:18,020
could say he's updated so that new

710
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:23,149
Charlotte secret generated from this key

711
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:27,050
exchange is dipped into the SK he is

712
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:31,100
current I and our other sis keys so as

713
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:33,500
changes from previous version as I

714
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,960
already said with the qualifications it

715
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:39,770
this is frame-up it can be used not only

716
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,540
who is quantum keys change method but it

717
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,660
can be used regardless of the type of

718
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:50,140
key exchange methods and whether they a

719
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:53,109
classical quantum quantum safe ones so

720
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:56,000
small codification of using nonsense in

721
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:58,190
hospital constellation so only known

722
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,200
says from I guess a meter are used and

723
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:04,700
on xenon says that I exchanged in

724
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:08,120
nineteen unit exchanges and there was a

725
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,410
lot of text a lot of clarification added

726
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,450
for a key collision

727
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:15,450
because our key collision is a complex

728
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:21,419
topic and it is very well covered in I

729
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:24,598
quit too and since with additional key

730
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,789
exchanges we require information

731
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,750
exchange it followed by a child sa

732
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:33,660
exchange to complete the Ricki to

733
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,450
complete creating take a child sa the

734
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,890
collision are handed slightly

735
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:41,279
differently so I will talk about it

736
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,589
lately

737
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,859
take some attention so key derivation

738
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:49,078
also is defined because in previous

739
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:52,049
version it wasn't defined for a child s

740
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:56,369
a case and I under consideration updated

741
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:59,030
we just asked to rename a difficult

742
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:00,289
group to key exchange method registered

743
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,900
well

744
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:07,049
just a reminder what about a child sa

745
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,490
the greater of additional key exchanges

746
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:10,109
that performed in a serious and

747
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:15,509
informational exchange a set of old

748
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:18,270
chrigel this exchange and unification

749
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,220
allows to link responded to link these

750
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:25,230
information exchanges to previous great

751
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:28,500
child sa exchange and negotiation is the

752
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:30,000
same way now you could say in it and USA

753
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,950
is created only when the last

754
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,960
information exchange is complete so all

755
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:37,680
the exchanges are completed we can

756
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,579
compute the keys so it is an example of

757
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:46,680
how it takes place so what about Ricky

758
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:49,220
collisions I quit to say that if to be

759
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,710
is start Ricky processing module

760
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:54,808
simultaneously and then Ricky collision

761
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:58,140
take place that will result in creating

762
00:47:54,809 --> 00:48:00,480
two things and I quit to handles his

763
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:03,359
visa creation by determining who is

764
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,599
winner who is loser the loser by compare

765
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:11,819
announces and the loser has to delete

766
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:14,130
the extra say that secret and it is also

767
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:17,430
another situation is possible and duty

768
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:19,730
packet loss on the one side notice the

769
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:22,370
collision and it is

770
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:26,600
and it a little bit different in I

771
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:29,779
question well so with quantum safe key

772
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:32,390
exchange what's changed

773
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,480
comparing to Ike written a collision

774
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:38,990
must be result in a crate childís a so

775
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,150
before any information not before in

776
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,890
some cases it's impossible but in any

777
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,700
way information changes might not be

778
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:47,000
affected

779
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,450
no determining who is winner who is

780
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,550
loser

781
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,370
your information exchange must not take

782
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:54,350
place Rachel the same was determined who

783
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:57,650
is the winner who is losing and since

784
00:48:54,350 --> 00:49:01,610
say is created only when the last

785
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:03,890
information exchange is finished so once

786
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:07,100
a child child assay is finished now say

787
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:09,109
no extra is created yet so the loser

788
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:11,240
just stops Turk in process but not

789
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:15,860
initiated national information exchange

790
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:20,810
this is a difference and well error of

791
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:24,440
Hamelin in citation when due to packet

792
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:28,630
loss on the one site notice the

793
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:32,060
collision the other side will try to

794
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:33,710
transmit packets but besides that notice

795
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,990
the collision will send temporary files

796
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:38,150
and if occasion it is an implication for

797
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,700
the decides that didn't know didn't know

798
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:43,430
the collision sets it must stop Colie

799
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:47,210
Araki process that collision took place

800
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:51,290
and it is also possible that responder

801
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:53,900
lost its state before the next

802
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:56,800
information has changed computer I don't

803
00:49:53,900 --> 00:50:00,320
know network delay and something like

804
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,960
this and so if responder receives an

805
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,790
information exchange with additional

806
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,680
case change tenth if occasion continuing

807
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,710
that as it doesn't correspond to any

808
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,940
Stasi he respond with state not found

809
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:15,740
state not found

810
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:18,410
it's a non fatal notify new notification

811
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:22,250
that tells any shelters at the key

812
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:24,720
process failed just libel either tried

813
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:28,319
it again or I don't know

814
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,919
there is something wrong and how keys

815
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,509
are created in a child to say it

816
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,210
differently they created a new key

817
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:40,890
security differently from initial I

818
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:45,630
could say it was I can't immediate so we

819
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:49,319
just steal all these shared keys with

820
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:52,440
corresponding nonsense to PRF and get as

821
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:56,160
a ski shiitake mat depending on whether

822
00:50:52,440 --> 00:51:00,780
you Ricky I could say Oh Ricky oh great

823
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,879
jealousy so one outstanding issue and we

824
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:07,109
discuss it and we discuss it with Scott

825
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,810
and do we need nonsense fresh nonsense

826
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:12,630
in every I can't immediate or we can

827
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:15,660
reuse the nonsense from my case a need

828
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:18,599
so currently every I can't immediate or

829
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:23,420
informational if we talk about a childís

830
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:26,730
a case has its own pair of nonsense well

831
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,470
we're not sure that it is needed from

832
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,810
cryptography point of view probably we

833
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:38,189
should ask severe G well or probably

834
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:40,799
Scott will comment about it if you want

835
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:43,079
to comment I don't know of any any

836
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,380
cryptographically thing at all that they

837
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,450
always have to be fresh it was only for

838
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:50,910
lightness and we alright that's where I

839
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:55,160
get for proving lightness and that's all

840
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:55,160
right there well

841
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,530
they're equivalent can you go black back

842
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,930
a couple of slides I think if they won

843
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:14,210
the test three a child and information

844
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:17,629
all this still more then one more I

845
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:19,040
think it's that one so it's the reason

846
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,290
why you are actually using informational

847
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,460
extensions for the rest of the red child

848
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:29,330
stuff because we need to make an

849
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:35,780
additional key exchanges and we we want

850
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:39,200
to have the same properties as for

851
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:44,900
initial exchanges where every key

852
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:47,569
exchange is handle it by every exchange

853
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,270
method it handle it by a single like

854
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,820
exchange and that in that case it is I

855
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,960
can't immediate in this case it is

856
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,730
informational exchange we just reduce

857
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,070
information exchange for this purposes

858
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:00,260
just not arraignment and as I can't

859
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:02,900
imitate is that it's not committed but

860
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,990
for this purpose only yeah I would

861
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,190
because because we to make this work we

862
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,169
have to add new

863
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,790
intermediate it's already added there so

864
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:13,400
I was thinking about it we could also

865
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:15,080
add you know second you know new extends

866
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,290
type there just just to keep the

867
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,279
information out to be you know

868
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:21,110
informational messages because this is

869
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,150
thought that's really part of the

870
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:27,560
informational informational is some

871
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:32,540
purposes as far as in distant you can

872
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:34,310
you can do anything nice to have some

873
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:36,290
kind of separation of you know architect

874
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:38,630
you do information of it you know this

875
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,830
kind of information I information doctor

876
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,420
that you would have a you know create

877
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:44,029
child to do that but it just would be

878
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,700
it's it's just as minor purple well we

879
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:50,810
can define a new exchange but I don't

880
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:52,310
know is it is needed of course we if you

881
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:57,020
define new exchange it will be clearer

882
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:59,029
from the priests point of view but from

883
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:03,370
practical point of view information

884
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:05,870
exchanges this case is very very easy

885
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:08,180
distinguishable from any other

886
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:10,900
information exchange its content is

887
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:16,180
quite unique so it's just

888
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:19,210
in exchange type reason yeah I also

889
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,910
agree that using a different exchange

890
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:23,350
would be nicer for the state machine and

891
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:25,690
like it doesn't overload all the

892
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,880
informational payload handling and

893
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,860
avoids problems about what do you do if

894
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,260
you find it delete payload and this new

895
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:35,500
payload and and get bugs in there

896
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,210
and since you renamed the intermediate

897
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,800
exchange to Ike intermediate you now

898
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:48,520
have one that you can call sa

899
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:53,530
intermediate I am not channeling to be a

900
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:56,290
cider and +1 on what Tara is saying

901
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:58,780
exchange ideas are cheap and the other

902
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:00,970
thing is reusing exchanges makes parsing

903
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,610
hard it makes it more error-prone which

904
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:11,430
should be avoided

905
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:15,280
ok we'll consider it so thank you

906
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:17,529
questions comments and actually we

907
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,680
discussed with the IRS's for all the

908
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:25,480
also steam we ask for adoption it's our

909
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,180
opinion that as the draft is ready for

910
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:31,360
adoption and I just want to remind that

911
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:35,790
there is a topic an item in IPSec amid

912
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:38,350
chatter about hangeng quantum safe I

913
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:41,200
didn't quantum safe it it too I could do

914
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:43,569
so there's I think that the draft can be

915
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,200
used as a starting point as a good

916
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,200
starting point

917
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:55,029
yeah Michael Richardson here so I'm on

918
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,230
for adoption that's great and I just

919
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,960
want to make sure I understand

920
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:02,260
so this basically creates a framework in

921
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,270
which people that we have quantum key

922
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:08,620
exchange can now plug their specific

923
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:12,040
thing in I'm a little bit I'm a little

924
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:16,450
bit concerned about the chaining of

925
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:19,990
methods together I think it's going to

926
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:23,109
be really complicated to implement and

927
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:24,410
so I'm I actually kind of want to

928
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,589
suggest

929
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:29,299
that I don't know how to say that after

930
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:32,990
we have adopted this that we should

931
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:38,750
write another document that hat creates

932
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:42,109
two maybe even has to allocate Ayana

933
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:44,119
numbers to exchanges which we could

934
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:46,609
implement as ec d h with a lot of

935
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:48,200
padding or something such that people

936
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:51,680
could actually see if they have inter

937
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,868
operation with some pretend exchanges so

938
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,000
to see if there there there to see if

939
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:58,549
their state machine that processes these

940
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,470
extended things works correctly and

941
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:01,880
interoperates with the other guy state

942
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:03,709
machine that works properly

943
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,990
at which point we'll know that this

944
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,160
document is correct could you see what

945
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,750
I'm trying to say is we don't really

946
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,598
have a way to interrupt test and

947
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:15,049
validate this document unless some

948
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,910
people go and either already have done

949
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:21,230
the quantum exchanges that they want to

950
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:23,058
do and get it all out are these group 18

951
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,589
because it's so huge and it mere cards

952
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:26,509
and things that's exactly what I'm

953
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:29,029
trying to say use group eighteen okay

954
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:31,339
but but maybe give it a given another

955
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:33,380
number which is you know the other route

956
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:35,058
okay just so that it's something else

957
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,289
but I don't know some something like

958
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:39,259
that that's what my suggestion is that

959
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:42,470
that's somehow I think as a group we

960
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:45,859
need to validate that that the state

961
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:48,529
machine changes you proposing are are

962
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:50,900
well enough explained that we can get

963
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:53,150
interoperability later on well I just

964
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,569
want to it that there is at least one

965
00:57:53,150 --> 00:58:01,430
implementation of this draft current

966
00:57:55,569 --> 00:58:04,579
currently and at least one I don't know

967
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:07,308
where the fool or not the best hider has

968
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:10,519
implemented and myself has implement is

969
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:17,059
a full draft so it is and I'd like to

970
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:20,299
say that is it is a public server that

971
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:24,950
is open for anyone if somebody won't you

972
00:58:20,299 --> 00:58:27,109
have online testing grounds good okay so

973
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,000
if somebody won't just strike me I will

974
00:58:27,109 --> 00:58:30,859
you have been characters noting I'm

975
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,690
pretty sure I have to check but I'm

976
00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:34,759
pretty sure that there are early

977
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:37,110
allocation is available for temporary

978
00:58:34,759 --> 00:58:42,690
usage for large-scale experiments

979
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:44,760
good point seven either through

980
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,260
communion or we can also like add you

981
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,880
know there have been some requests on

982
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,560
adding you know twelve thousand bit and

983
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,220
sixty thousand beta our site groups

984
00:58:49,560 --> 00:59:01,200
those would be also new numbers and even

985
00:58:53,220 --> 00:59:04,109
bigger bigger is better so are

986
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,089
channeling to be s again we at LMU

987
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:08,040
Munich are actually working on a formal

988
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:35,460
verification model to make sure the

989
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:38,070
state machine is working any any

990
00:59:35,460 --> 01:00:01,070
concerns at this point with moving this

991
00:59:38,070 --> 01:00:04,740
towards working group adoption okay spot

992
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:07,680
hi Christian ops and this is a

993
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:12,589
presentation on the update that we

994
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,589
published to the IP TFS draft Oh

995
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:21,570
so just a reminder why why are we doing

996
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:24,509
this maybe didn't make this to as clear

997
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:27,240
as we can here last time

998
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:31,650
basically there I the current solution

999
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:36,089
is to just pad out ESP so you get a 1 to

1000
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:39,090
1 packet ratio for it well the current

1001
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:42,480
solution to the two hiding your packet

1002
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:44,880
sizes is to do is to pad it out and the

1003
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,590
end result is not deployable we've had

1004
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,210
people who tried to do this and it

1005
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,670
doesn't it's not deployable for them

1006
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:52,109
primary reason being if you see from the

1007
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:56,260
ground

1008
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:58,390
the left side shows you're utilizing a

1009
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:02,410
gigabyte of bandwidth right but you're

1010
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:04,690
only getting 200 meg and it's it's

1011
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:09,940
really not deployable for people the

1012
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:13,150
efficiency so the updates that was

1013
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:15,880
really kind of like hardening that came

1014
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:19,660
due to a couple things one we were

1015
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,280
implementing and two for the updates

1016
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:27,868
based on the things we heard back from

1017
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:32,320
the last IETF so and from psv folks on

1018
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:35,980
congestion control so that we added a

1019
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,720
like well so these are the updates and I

1020
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:42,609
think I have a slide on basically each

1021
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:44,830
one of these so we added a new Ike V to

1022
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:47,400
transform type so this is a nice way you

1023
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:51,069
know the the correct way to negotiate

1024
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:53,830
things on essays right so that basically

1025
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:57,400
it adds a new transform type the six is

1026
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:59,140
the next one in the after ESN and it

1027
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,020
allows you to say you want to do seat

1028
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:04,779
congestion control TFS non congestion

1029
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:06,730
control CFS or none and we make the

1030
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:10,210
suggestion if you're doing none just

1031
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:15,430
leave the TFS type out but it's there

1032
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:16,630
for to be round in the ground so this is

1033
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:18,580
used this is a mistake

1034
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,740
anybody who's really into the IKE

1035
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:23,049
probably is it's probably I I just

1036
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:24,790
thought like the earlier presentation

1037
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:27,250
I'm like oh man I wrote essay in it

1038
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:29,650
it's like auth or a child to create

1039
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:32,740
child essay is when this transform type

1040
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:35,260
happens not a say in it sorry about that

1041
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,970
in the draft it is correct I went back

1042
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:39,840
and check to make sure this was just a

1043
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,839
presentation error

1044
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,260
so one of the things we got from the

1045
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,910
working group was the that there might

1046
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,540
be devices that don't want to support

1047
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:50,859
fragmentation so only you know

1048
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:52,630
aggregation is fine because you've got a

1049
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:54,220
bunch of packets in one but

1050
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,790
fragmentation is hard because you have

1051
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:59,399
to keep things around to reassemble

1052
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:01,050
so we add a don't fragment notify

1053
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,520
message and this was this I looked

1054
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:05,130
around and this is basically how it's

1055
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:08,460
done for other things to modify how you

1056
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:10,950
know once you select transforms right

1057
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:14,130
how do you modify or say but you know

1058
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:18,359
with this caveat right and so I reused

1059
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:20,880
that concept so after during the like

1060
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:25,440
auth you you'll select - somebody would

1061
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:27,500
select yes I want to do TFS CC and then

1062
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:38,100
send a notification message back saying

1063
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:39,870
don't fragment yeah yeah so aggregating

1064
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,520
is not a costly thing right I mean you

1065
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,200
just get a packet and you break it up

1066
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,110
right it's not you're not waiting around

1067
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,629
or queuing up or anything

1068
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:51,420
so the we also updated the congestion

1069
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:53,610
control so we were doing some different

1070
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,560
thing with ike and it was just causing a

1071
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:57,390
lot of problems out of man so we just

1072
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:01,650
moved the congestion control information

1073
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:03,629
in band so you can see the boldface here

1074
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:05,940
so the old header was just the bits

1075
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:08,570
reserved in block offset followed by the

1076
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,430
packet data we've added some optional

1077
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:15,870
congestion control information and that

1078
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:17,359
is here so one of the some of the

1079
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:19,470
feedback I got was from david black

1080
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,030
about you know we needed to be a little

1081
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:24,689
bit less hand-wavy

1082
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:27,270
in our congestion control stuff so I

1083
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:29,640
went through and and you know basically

1084
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:33,600
made sure that we can implement the

1085
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:37,140
recommended TCP friendly congestion

1086
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:39,480
control mechanism and this is the data

1087
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:42,720
that is required to do that so it's a

1088
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,180
round-trip time was basically the time

1089
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,279
it takes to send and receive back the

1090
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,770
delay is the amount of time that it's

1091
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:53,040
transiting the control plane at the

1092
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:54,570
endpoint that that so we know the sender

1093
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,600
will send out the sequence number it

1094
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:59,850
gets back the the last sequence number

1095
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:02,549
it's able to calculate how long that was

1096
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:06,600
and it adds a delay and then that is the

1097
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:08,700
round-trip time the receiver Maru Sivir

1098
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,330
side is calculating the loss event rate

1099
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,149
based on that

1100
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:14,799
it's you know fairly complex but smart

1101
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:17,830
people thought about it and written you

1102
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,270
know drafts and you don't really have to

1103
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:22,120
think about it anymore you just have to

1104
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:23,470
follow the directions so that was what I

1105
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:28,600
put in here is how to follow the

1106
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:30,490
directions yeah so loss event rate so

1107
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,970
it's a fraction right loss event rate as

1108
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:37,390
a fraction it actually I think right so

1109
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:44,259
it goes into that formula there that was

1110
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:45,819
a lot prettier earlier right that really

1111
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,510
was pretty I don't know what happened to

1112
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,690
it

1113
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:52,000
it's almost unreadable now it's one over

1114
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:54,820
that whole thing right and P is your

1115
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,070
loss event rate and like a capital R as

1116
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:59,830
your round-trip time and this is

1117
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:03,700
basically so that tells it spits out

1118
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:05,920
packets per second to send so we've so

1119
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:08,770
what I Edition to the draft basically

1120
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,260
was to go through and align the language

1121
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:14,290
with the existing RFC's that are there

1122
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,330
and then we added an appendix which

1123
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:18,120
specifically says here's the data that

1124
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:20,980
was that's in the congestion control

1125
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:23,440
packet header plug it into this formula

1126
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:29,830
and you get packets per second out that

1127
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:32,800
you should be sending so that's the

1128
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:34,540
summary of the changes we basically so

1129
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,230
we've updated the work based on the

1130
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:40,120
working group comments the congestion

1131
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:42,580
control don't fragment and then on

1132
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:46,060
implementation experience we moved to

1133
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:49,360
the transform type and also the

1134
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:50,950
algorithm we added the guidance because

1135
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:54,550
we thought it would be important to let

1136
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:57,009
everybody know how to do it and so we're

1137
01:06:54,550 --> 01:07:02,710
wondering if we could do working group

1138
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:04,420
adoption David Mike so Christian and

1139
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:06,970
co-author asked me to take a real quick

1140
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:09,490
look at the congestion control stuff in

1141
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:11,470
here for me is it are you digging in the

1142
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:14,379
right place perspective simple one-word

1143
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:15,850
answer yes the two things going on one

1144
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,850
is our question has just told you about

1145
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:22,390
TFR see for the yes controlled stuff and

1146
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:25,720
the other is that they're planning to

1147
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:28,650
to reduce the previous case for non

1148
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:32,049
congestion controls by referencing the

1149
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:33,700
MPLS of a UDP RFC which survived

1150
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,350
trial-by-fire so we know that the

1151
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,689
discussion in there of how to deal with

1152
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:41,500
traffic that does not respond to respond

1153
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:42,340
to congestion is reasonably good words

1154
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,100
the chairs

1155
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:47,320
if this draft is adopted this is exactly

1156
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:51,009
so a draft which requesting an earlier

1157
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:52,690
TSV area review would be a good idea so

1158
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:55,210
the first thing is that they can't add

1159
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:57,190
up to nothing to talk her so we have to

1160
01:07:55,210 --> 01:08:00,430
reach other first well well so I thought

1161
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:02,440
that was just for the eighties yeah but

1162
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:04,390
this other heads up this this mean I

1163
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,950
mean the authors did a real good thing

1164
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,319
by asking a transfers per edge would

1165
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:10,600
take a look and if it goes forward you

1166
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,640
probably ought to ask for an early

1167
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,410
transport area review well well before

1168
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,630
working a blast call because there's a

1169
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:19,300
boatload of details in this text and

1170
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:21,400
that there that a good transfer really

1171
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:26,740
good transfer reviewer will help what

1172
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:29,410
will help the authors get right wages

1173
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:32,469
low for this plus festival thank you

1174
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:34,599
photon fragment because it was me who

1175
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:38,470
complained about it and then just a

1176
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:42,820
comment your purpose is to the purpose

1177
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:45,460
of your document is to feel as much data

1178
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:48,429
to ease be naked as possible

1179
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,720
no no I want to clarify that because

1180
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:51,130
that was something was misunderstood

1181
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,860
last time right we're not trying to make

1182
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:56,650
it efficient right we're trying to it's

1183
01:08:53,859 --> 01:08:59,019
it's traffic low confidentiality right I

1184
01:08:56,649 --> 01:09:01,809
mean the the purpose is to actually hide

1185
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,670
the data size you know and if you

1186
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:06,340
remember from last time there was a UNIX

1187
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:08,620
2017 presentation where they used in if

1188
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:11,500
sec tunnel and they put netflix data

1189
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:13,300
over it right and somebody was snooping

1190
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:16,170
on that and telling them what movie they

1191
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:20,170
were watching yes I understand but for

1192
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:24,060
the fixed packet size you want to put as

1193
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:24,060
many oh yes yeah

1194
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:31,389
and that's why my question of probably

1195
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:33,550
comment did you consider to reduce the

1196
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:36,599
size of reserved field because it looks

1197
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:39,339
like it's quite a lot of

1198
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:44,529
certain beats it and used for small

1199
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:47,500
packets it will just you use noticeable

1200
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:49,420
percent issue was we considered we

1201
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:51,509
thought about ways to do this where you

1202
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:55,030
could eliminate the header altogether

1203
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:56,920
yeah we're looking at generally the the

1204
01:09:55,030 --> 01:10:00,009
implementation will probably either be

1205
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,349
set at the maximum MTU or it will be

1206
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:05,260
path MTU discovered so will generally be

1207
01:10:02,349 --> 01:10:07,630
working you know with the largest MTU so

1208
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:10,239
the immune it is you're talking about

1209
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:12,880
twelve I find working Betts it's and

1210
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:15,519
it's something reserved beats in data

1211
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,060
book it's a team reserved beats the town

1212
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,880
used in your definition so it's probably

1213
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:24,699
it's to my name probably eight beats for

1214
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:27,219
flex is enough I mean do we get a nice

1215
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:29,799
alignment you know I think it doesn't

1216
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:38,349
matter anyway okay you booked you've

1217
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:40,719
just as much as possible yeah Paul

1218
01:10:38,349 --> 01:10:45,550
artist so you're using a traffic

1219
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:47,500
selector to to request this right no

1220
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:49,510
it's a transform type right so not a

1221
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,730
traffic selector oh it's a transform

1222
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:55,150
type-in yeah so basically it'll be you

1223
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:58,629
know you're off your key whether you do

1224
01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:01,030
ESN your diffie-hellman and then we're a

1225
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:10,599
die and whether you want to do TFS or

1226
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:14,139
not okay now I think if it's not clear

1227
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:16,540
or easier as a traffic selector now well

1228
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:19,480
because we operate in TFS only mode on

1229
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:21,550
the SI it doesn't you know it's it's it

1230
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:24,459
literally is talking about this essay is

1231
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:36,070
TFS or not I've made sense sort of at

1232
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:38,099
that level transfer auto mode okay fair

1233
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,099
enough

1234
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,270
so so if this is not an unchartered you

1235
01:11:44,139 --> 01:11:48,190
know there was in it actually

1236
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:51,700
so do people actually think that they

1237
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:53,799
understand that what this problem is is

1238
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:58,090
this how many people actually think that

1239
01:11:53,800 --> 01:12:00,280
they know that what is this is for oh no

1240
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:01,510
but at least about and do think that

1241
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:05,200
it's actually something that we should

1242
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:08,590
show me here an idea and in this working

1243
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,720
group alright so I think if Emily have

1244
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:12,610
the proper call and ask for the 80s and

1245
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,890
figure out if they can actually reach

1246
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:16,690
other artists I think they'd have seemed

1247
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:18,550
to be clear interest and I guess the

1248
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:28,320
response of people what would be we need

1249
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:31,150
to review and perhaps implement that is

1250
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,259
something that we should do I mean this

1251
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:35,469
is something that Mike which was

1252
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:38,230
supposed to have done from the start we

1253
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:41,470
had this think it was identification

1254
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:46,059
that traffic flow for confidentiality is

1255
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:48,250
or isn't supported and yeah we were

1256
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:53,370
supposedly been doing it for over ten

1257
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:53,370
years it's time that we actually did it

1258
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,750
measurement dynamic the real traffic or

1259
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:06,670
is there you know there's one of the

1260
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:09,880
things I have equality quite often you

1261
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:12,190
know especially the other direction it's

1262
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,080
going to be very very small pockets but

1263
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:15,610
you need to get them quite quickly

1264
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,130
because otherwise you don't if you don't

1265
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:20,740
get acts you don't sell the thief oh yes

1266
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:22,120
so it was just kind of hidden in the so

1267
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:23,620
I didn't actually bring up like to

1268
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,570
docker containers and run it but what I

1269
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,090
did do to make it realistic right is

1270
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:31,210
it's I mix right so this is using a

1271
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:33,310
standard firewall I mix which is seven

1272
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:35,830
seven and seven so the distribution is

1273
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:39,300
seven four one and the packet sizes for

1274
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:41,830
the distribution are 40 byte 40/60 four

1275
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:44,200
five seventy six and fifteen hundred

1276
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:47,019
right and I was even I was very fair to

1277
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,389
ESP because ESP with padding is really

1278
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:52,270
really horrible with 1500 they're like

1279
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:54,160
it's half right like and I was like you

1280
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:55,870
know but really it's not 1500 we're

1281
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,389
talking about the largest path MTU so I

1282
01:13:55,870 --> 01:14:00,220
actually went to 1460 for this graph to

1283
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:01,480
be fair to ESP

1284
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:06,400
you know because I knew it would adjust

1285
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:10,089
but yeah you can't wait for a note you

1286
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,740
know has to be communicated forever

1287
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:13,690
because you won't attend acts you know

1288
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:15,070
yeah yeah it was I mean that there's a

1289
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,480
big latency problem as well right

1290
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:19,330
because you're sending all these bytes

1291
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,580
and so instead of going 64 64 64 you're

1292
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:23,680
hearing 64 plus a lot of padding the

1293
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,000
six-four puts a lot of padding so that's

1294
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:36,130
the other reason it doesn't work with

1295
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:38,370
TCP well so okay check out and see okay

1296
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,370
thank you

1297
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:54,430
Aysen obvious pitocin texting I'm Wiccan

1298
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:57,550
from Hawaii

1299
01:14:54,430 --> 01:15:01,680
today I want to introduce our world a

1300
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:07,950
little bit optimization for rekeying

1301
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:12,250
ipsa or child sa first you can see the

1302
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:16,690
original routine message exchange like

1303
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:19,390
that if if the configuration like the

1304
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:23,349
cryptographic suites or the traffic

1305
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:26,680
selectors doesn't change but the routine

1306
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:32,770
will at work in the essay and the TSP

1307
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:35,350
loads will also be transmitted and even

1308
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:39,390
if the trans even you even though these

1309
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:43,060
are transmitted but as a selected

1310
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:46,660
cryptographic suits or TS will not

1311
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:52,620
change when doing the routine so we

1312
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:56,110
think this can be optimized and for

1313
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:58,750
because the a key sa and Chavez is are

1314
01:15:56,110 --> 01:16:01,690
looking this working happened

1315
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:05,950
periodically so for the constraint

1316
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:09,210
device like IOT devices processing the

1317
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:12,440
SA and TS payloads in such case is our

1318
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:17,300
periodically burden

1319
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:20,660
can be admitted in Fiji networks there

1320
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:24,710
are more than many devices like more

1321
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:28,450
than ten thousands and devices these

1322
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:31,940
devices may have only one gateway to

1323
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:36,860
establish like a key or an IPSec

1324
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:40,849
eternals so this the bandwidth that the

1325
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:45,679
SA and TS pillows occupied can be a huge

1326
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:51,070
burden for the Gateway in such case so

1327
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:56,510
our optimization solutions is very easy

1328
01:16:51,070 --> 01:17:00,349
when doing the racking IKS a we do not

1329
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:02,720
need to transmit the SI payloads we just

1330
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:07,340
need to send our new notification

1331
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:10,460
payload with a new spi and for routine

1332
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:13,700
child essays it's a similar we'd only to

1333
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:17,450
transmit Si and TS pillows we just

1334
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:23,330
transmit our new pillow notification

1335
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:27,950
payload with the SPI first when you need

1336
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:32,210
to do such optimal optimal aging you

1337
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:36,340
need to we add a new notification to

1338
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:40,490
indicate the support for this

1339
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:43,580
functionality we call it a mini more

1340
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:47,719
wiki supported a notification and it it

1341
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:51,970
will be send at IP of message exchange

1342
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:54,920
the initiator sender this included and

1343
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:58,430
if the responder also supported this

1344
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:02,480
function it can respond reply with this

1345
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:05,810
notification and you can see the payload

1346
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:12,669
format as below it's contains no date

1347
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:16,640
it's very simple about tricking I KSA's

1348
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:20,630
in the draft we divided induce the

1349
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:24,110
riders three cases but the most common

1350
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:28,219
situation the first one

1351
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:31,040
is that no change of crypto crap graphic

1352
01:18:28,219 --> 01:18:34,940
sweets in the initiator and a responder

1353
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:39,159
so the initiator can send record si

1354
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:44,269
unchanged payload and the responder well

1355
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:45,110
reply with responder spi in the SA

1356
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:51,139
unchanged it

1357
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:55,099
payload about the left two cases it may

1358
01:18:51,139 --> 01:19:01,270
not so common especially for the second

1359
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:04,909
if the initiators see has changed it may

1360
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:09,800
immediately send there's a reckoning

1361
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:13,638
message and if it's a real change that

1362
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:17,780
means the previously negotiated CS is

1363
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:22,300
not existed so the responder may not

1364
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:26,259
have the chance to choose that one so so

1365
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:30,739
the number two case may may be not so

1366
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:34,699
real but for the third chance a certain

1367
01:19:30,739 --> 01:19:36,650
case that the responder changed but the

1368
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:40,159
initiator doesn't change so the

1369
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:43,099
initiator will also still send at the SA

1370
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:46,070
unchanged and the responder will respond

1371
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:50,980
with no problem chosen to indicate that

1372
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:55,099
the previous negotiated CS is not

1373
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:59,900
allowed and then the original routine

1374
01:19:55,100 --> 01:20:02,780
can be conducted again if I make this

1375
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,750
suggestion as case number two sounds

1376
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:07,340
both rare and it sounds it might be a

1377
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:09,920
little more difficult to handle you may

1378
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:13,219
just want to forbid that and just only

1379
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:18,340
go with either one or three yeah I agree

1380
01:20:13,219 --> 01:20:18,340
with you maybe I will change it later

1381
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:26,900
for the SA unchanged at payload the

1382
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:35,199
format and it's also very easy it only

1383
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:35,199
contains our spi pay value anything

1384
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:43,370
okay okay

1385
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:46,250
about wrecking the child essays it's

1386
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:49,760
similar with that one but the case is

1387
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:52,670
that a no change of practice horrific

1388
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:57,800
sweet sweets and the ACO or the

1389
01:20:52,670 --> 01:21:01,780
trafficker information so the payload is

1390
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:07,660
a and the same but the SPI is four bytes

1391
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:12,050
you can see the format we list here is

1392
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:16,000
comparison the left is a previous the

1393
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:21,260
orange no one and the right is after we

1394
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:24,070
optimized it and it's just a show and

1395
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:28,550
about the optimization effect we

1396
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:34,250
calculated the rights before and after

1397
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:37,300
optimization you can see that about when

1398
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:44,179
doing the child essays the reduce the

1399
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:50,719
price percentages it's a quite valuable

1400
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:52,699
I think if more than one CSR content in

1401
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:58,340
the essay pillows then the reduce the

1402
01:21:52,699 --> 01:22:01,879
bytes will increased slightly also if

1403
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:04,370
you if you don't send the essay pillows

1404
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:08,030
and it just ascended this the

1405
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:12,980
calculation a computation will be easier

1406
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:15,530
so the time will be saved about future

1407
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:18,290
program we will come more comments and

1408
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:22,370
reviews and we are looking for working

1409
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:24,769
group at option yeah Michael Richardson

1410
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:27,010
just a question for implementers in the

1411
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:31,880
room when people

1412
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:34,130
configure new policies on responders do

1413
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:37,219
you actually enforce them how do you

1414
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:39,800
actually enforce them on existing essays

1415
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:42,739
I'm actually asking about the case three

1416
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:45,050
that he you killed them all and you make

1417
01:22:42,739 --> 01:22:48,040
them initialize everything anybody else

1418
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:48,040
do something different

1419
01:22:55,689 --> 01:23:02,030
we will actually implement the new

1420
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:04,999
policy on Ariki on a rekey of the child

1421
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:08,360
si okay so so you would actually face

1422
01:23:04,999 --> 01:23:10,969
this case three what I was hypothesizing

1423
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:13,938
is that everyone did what the Oh F does

1424
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:15,889
either just lets them go until they they

1425
01:23:13,939 --> 01:23:18,590
go and then goes oops you're dead

1426
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:20,479
just try over and for remote access

1427
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:24,019
scenarios they go down and up so often

1428
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:27,469
that's probably easy Oh or if it's a

1429
01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:29,719
site-to-site the the with the new policy

1430
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:33,050
you initiate immediately with the new

1431
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:35,449
policy and you kill what was there and

1432
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:37,729
so my hypothesis is that number three is

1433
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:40,579
almost never encountered that's my

1434
01:23:37,729 --> 01:23:46,209
hypothesis right but it sounds like it's

1435
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:49,009
not true um there so yep

1436
01:23:46,209 --> 01:23:51,409
supposing we have tunnels that are being

1437
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:54,019
used in their using single deaths and we

1438
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:58,909
suddenly decided to change the policy to

1439
01:23:54,019 --> 01:24:00,769
do a SDC m256 and now I can't believe

1440
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:05,388
we're waiting an hour until the old

1441
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:08,389
desta say is going to expire it does

1442
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:11,090
make some sense in when both sides are

1443
01:24:08,389 --> 01:24:14,149
not simultaneously configured so maybe I

1444
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:16,399
changed the policy of one and it's doing

1445
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:20,139
a rekey well the other is not yet to

1446
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:24,579
change so this could happen but yeah

1447
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:24,579
it's not real a very realistic angry

1448
01:24:25,149 --> 01:24:31,729
voters so I really like this this drafyn

1449
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:34,159
and when I started reading it and I went

1450
01:24:31,729 --> 01:24:36,169
back to the IP to RFC there there's

1451
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,138
specific text an error in the course

1452
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:40,969
here it says during rekeying if you see

1453
01:24:39,139 --> 01:24:42,499
the traffic selectors really make sure

1454
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:45,619
that they're the same because we don't

1455
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:47,419
want to negotiate slightly differently

1456
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:48,619
neighbors and traffic slackers and end

1457
01:24:47,419 --> 01:24:51,409
up with a different tunnel after

1458
01:24:48,619 --> 01:24:54,289
rekeying and when you read it you go

1459
01:24:51,409 --> 01:24:55,999
like why did we even ever allow that to

1460
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:57,739
happen we should have just not sent a

1461
01:24:55,999 --> 01:24:59,400
traffic selector so that people couldn't

1462
01:24:57,739 --> 01:25:02,400
make that mistake

1463
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:06,089
and this is exactly what you're doing so

1464
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:10,070
so so I think this is a great idea and

1465
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:10,070
we should have done this like in 2004

1466
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:20,490
this plus I think this is interesting

1467
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:27,480
idea it is not from my opinion it is not

1468
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:30,679
very useful for iqc why because well it

1469
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:35,190
depends on fermentation but for a key

1470
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:39,450
you're not you can initiate it can send

1471
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:42,299
only those transforms that were accepted

1472
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:45,750
that were used in privilege to say if

1473
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:48,450
it's poverty is poly seasons changed so

1474
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:51,750
the win that you have with notification

1475
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:54,510
is don't send in any transform at all

1476
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:56,520
yes they are negligible for Agassi Piper

1477
01:25:54,510 --> 01:26:00,270
circus a it is different in this police

1478
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:05,310
8 IP to RFC requires to send traffic

1479
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:08,340
selectors in every key of a childís a

1480
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:11,190
and traffic's lectures can be quite long

1481
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:15,690
so if you are meet traffic's like well

1482
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:18,889
if you simplify your draft get rid of

1483
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:22,200
many options that complicate

1484
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:24,330
implementations and probably if you get

1485
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,610
rid of say recent in the same traffic

1486
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:30,740
silly actress designer a rookie this can

1487
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:33,929
be quite long the win will be I think

1488
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,010
the trade-off of implementation it will

1489
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:40,560
be better

1490
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:42,810
yeah we will consider as acid you know

1491
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,990
member of group Nocturne has a check so

1492
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:47,580
I was expecting about this original

1493
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:49,139
thing about the assets actually is you

1494
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:51,780
know small optimization but you gotta

1495
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:55,500
make it useful and especially about the

1496
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:57,650
photo Ricky for the child SS and yeah I

1497
01:26:55,500 --> 01:27:00,000
think we actually should just you know

1498
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:01,769
you can actually if we negotiate

1499
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,570
disappear off beforehand we don't

1500
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:05,700
actually need a neat cut off most of

1501
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:07,230
their stuff and we could just leave out

1502
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:10,710
you know if if you leave out the traffic

1503
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:13,230
selectors or sorry if you have a Ricky

1504
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:16,440
notify the Ricky sa notification

1505
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:17,879
there it gives you the old FBI we could

1506
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,739
actually just pick a better that said

1507
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,630
you know new SBI after that and ream out

1508
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:23,910
they say and traffic shocked repellers

1509
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:25,560
completely because now if we are

1510
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:27,750
wreaking we are using exactly same

1511
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:30,900
algorithm we are using exactly same you

1512
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:32,730
know traffic selectors we just need to

1513
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:35,099
change the spi and generate a new key

1514
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:36,989
of course that's many most of the cases

1515
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,000
useful thing would be also to do the you

1516
01:27:36,989 --> 01:27:42,360
know differ at the same time if you have

1517
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:46,020
a BFS but that's a separate issue for I

1518
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:48,150
guess a you know if it get a little bit

1519
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:50,989
more and it's actually much more let's

1520
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:53,610
say you have only one I guess a usually

1521
01:27:50,989 --> 01:27:55,080
might have you know thousands of IPC

1522
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:57,030
cases and you might freaky them much

1523
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,920
more often than you do I kiss I know I

1524
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:01,290
don't know I don't really see you know

1525
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,300
there's really no reason to

1526
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:06,390
for example tricky I guess a ever

1527
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:08,130
because of the traffic limits because it

1528
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:11,580
takes so long time to actually be able

1529
01:28:08,130 --> 01:28:12,989
to transmit anything you know so much

1530
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:15,000
later that you actually need Ricky

1531
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:16,860
because of that so they I guess a

1532
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,780
rekeying in most tests you know because

1533
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:20,489
oh we want to Ricky because we want to

1534
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,900
limit that you know the exposure if

1535
01:28:20,489 --> 01:28:23,790
somebody hacks into the my system so

1536
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:25,799
let's say no March a day or something

1537
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:27,870
like that so it's a much more seldom

1538
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,700
than the IPSec cases so I think that

1539
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:32,220
basically say case is the more important

1540
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:34,380
one and I think we should just you know

1541
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,800
say that okay we do the full moon or

1542
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,470
Mille

1543
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:40,430
if the police we've changed so that your

1544
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:43,260
traffic selectors or your you know

1545
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:46,710
algorithms don't match anymore it's not

1546
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:49,320
Ricky maybe you create a new si and

1547
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:51,330
delete the old one if it's Ricky meaning

1548
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:53,700
your algorithms and graphics across same

1549
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:56,280
you just freaky by saying you know we

1550
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:58,410
have a Ricky si and here is an SPI and

1551
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,849
here a second SPI that skills to coach

1552
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:16,080
the new ESP I don't think we actually

1553
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:17,010
need anything else so I have a question

1554
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,190
one your rekeying

1555
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:24,590
childís says could you go to the slide

1556
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:28,440
that shows the the exchange

1557
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:31,050
sorry what can you go them back to this

1558
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:35,009
slide that shows the exchange show like

1559
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:38,480
change this one I know the actual the

1560
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:43,320
swim track diagram nevermind

1561
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:45,599
how do I know which would just say it is

1562
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:50,940
the time which child say it is the time

1563
01:29:45,600 --> 01:30:00,420
Ricky oh you can refer to the Ricky s a

1564
01:29:50,940 --> 01:30:02,070
notification it contains the SPI yeah I

1565
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:12,000
saw that about the new notification but

1566
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:14,219
but alright so sir chair addicted

1567
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,770
actually goes under our stop of

1568
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:19,469
compressing like an IPSec park so

1569
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:22,860
exactly who it is in the Charter so this

1570
01:30:19,469 --> 01:30:24,600
is actually could be the top we don't

1571
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:27,780
have to recharge which is surprising

1572
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:34,280
because I'm assuming we have to but then

1573
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:37,590
I was freaking out smaller for the

1574
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:39,090
constraint devices so even it has

1575
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:40,469
actually expect that most of these

1576
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:43,560
devices that you are running on what

1577
01:30:40,469 --> 01:30:45,210
constrains privacy after actually much

1578
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:50,670
more powerful than most of the other

1579
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:52,170
things but anyway so so okay let's make

1580
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:53,580
the same questions again okay how many

1581
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:56,300
people actually think that they

1582
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:58,650
understand that what this problem is

1583
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:00,150
alright and how many people actually

1584
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:04,639
think that this is something that we

1585
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:04,639
should show here I mean in this vertical

1586
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:11,760
okay and so how many people are

1587
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:14,269
interested on working on this and and

1588
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:16,920
perhaps making three billion crafts and

1589
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:20,100
okay and how many have already wrecked

1590
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:23,430
the trot okay oh but the same people who

1591
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:25,260
are interested so I think there's

1592
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:30,480
actually is enough interest on that oh

1593
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:32,400
yeah so I think tell me so and you think

1594
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:35,160
that this draft is 24 over me group

1595
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,728
adoption or do you have more change this

1596
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,469
based on their what what they actually

1597
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:43,719
discussing here and option I'm sorry sir

1598
01:31:40,469 --> 01:31:45,429
do you think that it's ready now yeah I

1599
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:48,219
think it's ready all right because we

1600
01:31:45,429 --> 01:31:50,320
are making changes also after we have

1601
01:31:48,219 --> 01:31:52,179
enough to test about eco approximate and

1602
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:54,308
as I said I had a couple of ideas people

1603
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:55,959
actually make it even more better now Oh

1604
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:58,150
a warhorse trains or something like that

1605
01:31:55,959 --> 01:31:59,979
and and of course the question is do we

1606
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:01,869
how much we actually want to do optimize

1607
01:31:59,979 --> 01:32:06,459
I quit I press a wiki is also a lot in

1608
01:32:01,869 --> 01:32:09,009
it but uh but yes so so think we could

1609
01:32:06,459 --> 01:32:13,030
actually start about the group what up

1610
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:15,789
can call that mimosa right yeah that's a

1611
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:22,889
minute yeah okay and I think that was

1612
01:32:15,789 --> 01:32:30,969
tossed so silly yeah any other business

1613
01:32:22,889 --> 01:32:39,519
any other business alright everybody

1614
01:32:30,969 --> 01:32:41,289
signed a blue sheet well since then no

1615
01:32:39,519 --> 01:32:46,150
one of NIST is coming up to talk about a

1616
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:49,659
shiny new document I will mention there

1617
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:51,719
is a new provision one draft guide to

1618
01:32:49,659 --> 01:32:53,949
deploying IPSec VPNs

1619
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:55,539
you should read it and comment on it

1620
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:59,759
because you shouldn't trust like the

1621
01:32:55,539 --> 01:32:59,759
authors wrote this
