1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:22,710
still kill seats in the front anyway

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,710
[Music]

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:34,350
okay hello Bonjour I am giving you a

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,910
Montreal good morning welcome this is IC

5
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,829
energy we have an excellent front-row

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:52,319
seat for in notetaker pond here

7
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:55,829
ah my case mr. Moscow so why people are

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,640
coming at us just get going quick

9
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,070
reminder of the IRT F ipi policy if you

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,890
contribute anything or you are you see

11
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,930
anything that you know is associated to

12
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,930
to IPR you are expected to let us know

13
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,930
soon

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,500
I see energy has the usual

15
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:25,100
infrastructure we have a main list and a

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:28,549
wiki we not used a wiki to know publish

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,189
info on upcoming meetings and so on

18
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:35,880
these are my coaches day for Ren and go

19
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,750
you woman I'm deaf crucial and yes we

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,839
mentioned we really need a note-taker to

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:45,270
start this meeting and note-taking is

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,790
really a light job and we don't catch

23
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,270
all the presentations just the question

24
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,590
and answers so that's the gist of the

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,840
discussion and there are no big formal

26
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,479
requirements so any text notes what we

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,729
find out ah thanks a lot Janice that's

28
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:12,429
great

29
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:12,429
okay we have a cool agenda today

30
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:20,000
so we gathered a few updates about what

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,910
happened in icy energy and I see em in

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,349
general moment we're not talking about

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:30,019
the ICN when program sorry I forgot to

34
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:34,810
update the agenda so Dirk is gonna give

35
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:42,890
us a update of the ICN over 5g draft and

36
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:48,860
the ICN v chillin draft Tasha is some

37
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:55,760
update about the CCM info work we have

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:59,299
this our ICN lopen group item that has

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,030
evolved very nicely so Thomas is

40
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:07,400
actually given an update on this and if

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:10,910
we think it's there are pretty pretty

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,650
ready so let's look at the data Angela

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:19,069
device will talk about the two nice

44
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:22,760
documents and we also assess the status

45
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:31,929
of those is there anything we missed all

46
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:36,679
that people want to eat oh yeah

47
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,030
that's very important actually it fits

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:53,269
better and later put in the agenda but

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:54,859
okay nevermind so we had several site

50
00:03:53,269 --> 00:04:03,290
meetings this week and there's one of

51
00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:09,769
those okay there's a there's a story to

52
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:14,470
live up to this photo so as you may have

53
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:16,130
seen the RSC editor has recently

54
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,550
published

55
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:23,030
you see sine X cosine X semantics and

56
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:25,670
message formats so thanks to the great

57
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,690
work of the authors Micmac Moscow

58
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:52,160
natural solos and Chris Wood this is now

59
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:54,580
officially published and this work

60
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,830
starts now

61
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,859
right this is not the end it's a new

62
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:05,479
beginning

63
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:08,570
okay yeah so then let's get to the say

64
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,090
updates and information on what has been

65
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:17,240
going on in ICN so we had this interim

66
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:19,669
meeting on Sunday if you couldn't make

67
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,930
it so these were the topics that we

68
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:28,670
discussed so Christian gave us an update

69
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:31,280
about his his ideas on say yeah push

70
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,580
based operational say push based

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,140
application semantics and how that could

72
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,479
be or should be mapped to say I see and

73
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,700
network layers and so there are

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,960
different views how this could be done

75
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,180
and also what the effect of push

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,820
application semantics really have to be

77
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,020
for for for the ISIL Network check out

78
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,030
the the presentation that's something

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:05,349
out they are all in the daylight tracker

80
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:10,940
already so mark had updated a draft on

81
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:13,840
selectors in CCX that could be you can

82
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,450
use for discovery for example so that's

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,419
the idea that you can basically attach

84
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,990
predicates through the name in an

85
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:29,990
interest packet and then notes that

86
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:32,150
support this feature can basically

87
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:39,770
yeah gives you information based on on

88
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:46,849
these predicates we havin a new version

89
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:51,880
of the ipok so IP over CCN draft by Greg

90
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:55,849
and and so we want to adopt this as a

91
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,860
research group item so three information

92
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:02,419
we would also do the usual confirmation

93
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,090
on the main list but just let you know

94
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:10,060
that that was the outcome of the sunday

95
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:14,869
meeting we don't talk about hop-by-hop

96
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:19,580
authentication for CCN x + + en networks

97
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:25,400
and then we had a presentation and

98
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:31,669
discussion on ICN and us so if you had

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:34,940
been at the the previous IETF meeting it

100
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,008
and at the ice energy meeting there so

101
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:43,009
that we had a longer discussion about

102
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:46,060
ICN and Q s and so basically exploit the

103
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:51,610
potential so in general the idea is that

104
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:54,169
since when I see em you first of all you

105
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,719
you have mooc resources that you can

106
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:02,539
control that allow you to do something

107
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:05,030
useful for 4q s behavior but also you

108
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:07,219
have potentially more expressiveness in

109
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:12,409
the protocol so and the names for

110
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:16,039
example to actually classify flows for

111
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:20,240
example and so this combination is a

112
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:23,830
very powerful basis to talk us say much

113
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:29,389
better than we were able to do in IP and

114
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:32,360
so Thomas and colleagues had done some

115
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:37,849
experimental work along those lines for

116
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,659
IOT so in a very constrained networks

117
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,370
network of course it's interesting and

118
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,900
potentially

119
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,010
quite important - two minutes resources

120
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,670
yeah according to the application

121
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,870
requirements and so that presentation

122
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,130
had some interesting results so

123
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,050
basically showed the great potential and

124
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:04,100
so that was an interesting discussion

125
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:11,240
and so we we have other documents on IC

126
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:17,300
nqs that for example i talked about how

127
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,850
to label flows how to implement us

128
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,630
treatment so this discussion will

129
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:29,600
continue hopefully next time next video

130
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:34,460
ok quick announcement so there's going

131
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,580
to be that the ACM ICN conference in

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:43,790
September in Hong Kong also by Hong Kong

133
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:46,730
City you nobility the TPC meeting for

134
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,589
the main program has just happened on

135
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,260
the weekend so the program will be

136
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:57,800
announced say in a few weeks okay so

137
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,010
give us some time but there's still an

138
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,500
open call for posters and demos so if

139
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:07,610
you want to be part of that please check

140
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:14,120
it out and see how you want to

141
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:19,550
contribute so that's September 24 to 26

142
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:23,690
and on the day day before September 23rd

143
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:25,640
there's a really cool event also in Hong

144
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:33,380
Kong so it's not co-located to the

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:38,060
conference on using ICN in this case NDN

146
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:42,380
for producing media so that's Jeff

147
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:46,869
Burke's activity so trying to connect

148
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:50,510
the ICN Indian community that was the

149
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,820
media and Performing Arts community so

150
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,720
should be really nice if you come to

151
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,240
Hong Kong anyway

152
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,920
consider attending an event as well

153
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:06,089
itself

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:09,819
three and then the planning for ICN 2020

155
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:14,079
has started so they are hosting

156
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:19,149
opportunities per year send out a call

157
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:22,209
for proposals recently on the mailing

158
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:24,970
list so if you're interested to host a

159
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,089
conference next year please respond to

160
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,089
that

161
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:38,139
okay quick reminder this is almost but

162
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:43,600
not 100% complete overview of say that

163
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:47,529
the work that we do in icy energy and so

164
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,410
you see like the fundamental activities

165
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,620
so underlies embeddings core protocols

166
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:56,469
and then we have things like us that I

167
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,089
just mentioned I just brought up a

168
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,949
picture again because of follow that

169
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:06,339
Dave showed earlier because these are

170
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:11,949
the core specs that we just published

171
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:14,220
and just to explain this so it's this is

172
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:18,219
an a research group so it's not that

173
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,199
basically produce like the one ICN

174
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,959
standard we don't use the nuts anyway

175
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,120
these are just experimental

176
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:29,589
specifications but this is just one way

177
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,560
of doing I see em that's CG and X so

178
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:36,579
this group is totally open to other ways

179
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:41,560
other protocols applications the whole

180
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:43,689
idea is what who document those that

181
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,109
people are interested to use that are

182
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,810
kind of mature in some way with the goal

183
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,500
to enable more experiments and more more

184
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,410
cool research so just to to to explain

185
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,569
it this is not basically the only only

186
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:05,199
technology or the only protocol that I

187
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:07,949
see energy is doing and so this brings

188
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,540
up the number of ice energy are six to

189
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:15,040
six that's

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:19,589
it's actually quite nice and so we hope

191
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,860
to get out more

192
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:29,200
say useful specification documents like

193
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:34,030
this this these are the say active

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:38,020
leadership drafts so we would hear

195
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:42,610
presentations on a few of those later

196
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:47,530
today just let me just quickly check the

197
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:50,080
deployment guidelines document that's

198
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,020
finished we think it's finished and I

199
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,540
see energy what's the current status in

200
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,120
India is she waiting for irst final call

201
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,870
okay and there's another one which is

202
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,350
the next one disaster disaster which has

203
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:08,500
is in IRC final poll and I think some of

204
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,920
the irst members have yet to send in

205
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:17,080
their poll votes okay - Colin so both of

206
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,910
those are within days - week or two from

207
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,310
going to the RFC editor for final

208
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,900
qualification right there's one mistake

209
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,209
here this is the net me one this is

210
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,780
actually not a researcher draft I think

211
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,190
it's just Sexton named miss names we

212
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,500
need to work on that to get that

213
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:37,900
corrected perhaps or just find a

214
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,090
phonetic solution and terminology is is

215
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,360
the same so that's also we believe ready

216
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,250
and terminology there's a two-step

217
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,800
process when we finish we finish

218
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,230
anarchie all everybody's happy the next

219
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,370
step is there's our actual formal review

220
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:57,250
by IRS G members and I believe we are

221
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,840
waiting to start that with you or it's a

222
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,560
dinner if you know I think we're wait

223
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,940
it's calling in the room no all right

224
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,479
well we need to go vote Colin because

225
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:11,920
here's this reaction items now but we

226
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,070
will do that this week and so there's

227
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:20,410
one one draft that is currently expired

228
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:22,440
that this is flick so file like ICN

229
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,689
collections manifests

230
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:32,280
or see CNX at least so far so that's a

231
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:35,310
also really say useful and important you

232
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:39,209
could say base technology that for for

233
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:41,130
our city necks so we hope to we select

234
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:45,450
this pretty soon Cynthia can see a few

235
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:48,990
words so Christian and Mark and I got

236
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,780
together earlier I forget what day it

237
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:56,190
was already and we have a plan put

238
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,839
together for finishing that draft there

239
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,270
doesn't need to be very much work on it

240
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,920
it's very solid but there are three

241
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:05,130
things that really needed to be done

242
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,930
which we will do in the next iteration

243
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,980
and we'll get it resubmitted number one

244
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:14,430
is to formally define the extensibility

245
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:18,170
model and how you extend the manifest

246
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:23,239
formats because that was under specified

247
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:26,819
the second is to produce not just a CCN

248
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:30,260
messages protocol mapping from manifests

249
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,010
but an indian protocol mapping of

250
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,470
manifests who will have identical

251
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,260
manifest formats for both underlying

252
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:42,240
protocol architectures and the third is

253
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:44,610
that the way it works now is the the

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,930
pointers in the manifest are two raw

255
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:51,900
hashes which says that if the consumer

256
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,849
wants to know something about the

257
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,850
content they actually have to fetch the

258
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,510
content so there was no capability of

259
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:04,530
any cup of annotations or small metadata

260
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,150
that would give a consumer advice about

261
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,099
whether they actually want to bother

262
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,699
fetching that content or not so we're

263
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,319
adding annotations on the hash values so

264
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,610
an example of what you might use this

265
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,129
for is if it's a manifest for a video

266
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:22,020
asset and each hash value is a frame of

267
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,089
the video you can annotate that with

268
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,160
with for example what the preferred

269
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,970
fetch order is should you fetch in

270
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,679
decode order or presentation order well

271
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,929
and potentially other annotation so

272
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,700
those are the three changes enhancements

273
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,710
we expect to make to it and hopefully

274
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:44,730
they have a new version for people who

275
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:46,529
see in the future thank you Dave just

276
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,750
quickly again on the season X

277
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:51,299
specifications so if you're new to this

278
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,500
group and and you want to understand

279
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,019
what this is about

280
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,169
of course first of all check out the RCS

281
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:02,220
but other than that mark is going to

282
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:06,510
give a short summary of those documents

283
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:10,799
later today in IOT IRT F open so be

284
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,408
there if you're interested ok and so

285
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:17,789
with that this concludes our updates

286
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:19,669
overview and material Chuck would be

287
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:25,260
next

288
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:28,110
no Dave's not next mistake so we do this

289
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:39,149
again I fail to deliver we do this next

290
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:43,879
time with mom who's taking ok thanks

291
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:48,418
vision update on the far g IC n 5g draft

292
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,190
and like Robbie definitely wanted to be

293
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,679
online but I hadn't seen in actually on

294
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,190
the online over there and with my

295
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,919
courses here the updates

296
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,080
relate to draft that we we've currently

297
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,830
as a have as an IRT F 2 alpha which is

298
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,500
the the 4G draft Ford was in law school

299
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,240
but I might get that wrong we also and I

300
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,570
come to this slider it relates to the

301
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,799
the next presentation draft where we've

302
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,549
taken things out and put it into a

303
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,100
separate draft and this 12 have said is

304
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:22,220
about enabling IC n 5g systems so it

305
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,340
makes direct references to ongoing 5g

306
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,620
work in 3gpp and leverages some of the

307
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,230
design principles are also included in

308
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,350
the 4G traffic so it's good to also look

309
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,169
at that traffic maybe there's an overlap

310
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,120
and also says as you will notice the

311
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:40,590
updates in v4 we did a couple of

312
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,330
editorial changes that we combined the

313
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,918
architectural pieces together do not

314
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,049
have too many sections we combined the

315
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,929
actual next-gen core architecture which

316
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,620
talks mainly about the 5g components as

317
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,800
they defined its

318
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,750
TPP and the specific part and how to

319
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,520
actually extend the factory core

320
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,620
connection with IC and support that's

321
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,980
being combined in a single section for

322
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,959
editorial reasons we also simplified the

323
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,700
section that was new in vo3

324
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,610
which talks about the 5g launch support

325
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,430
which is another area in in the sweet

326
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,800
bippy work on 5g at the moment and

327
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,170
specifically we removed the part there

328
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,730
was a use case for this the IP / ICN /

329
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,010
5g learn to separate internet draft

330
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,110
which comes next

331
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,870
and that might the whole section simpler

332
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,419
and we only kept the actual ICN over 5g

333
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,239
lon peace in the actual draft so it's a

334
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,420
trunk the section down we also added a

335
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,520
new description in a separate section

336
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:40,230
code on consideration so what we've done

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,520
we positioned the the the traffic

338
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,050
against the deployment consideration

339
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,629
draft itself so how does it fit in the

340
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,850
categorization of underlay versus

341
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,370
overlay as well as the different my

342
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,590
equations and it's based on the latest

343
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:56,010
version is currently in the in the in in

344
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,590
the poll that the chairs outlined so

345
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,210
these are the updates we made these are

346
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,889
some of the pictures you can see in the

347
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,040
draft as well as the 5g core design

348
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,800
guidelines that are being that are being

349
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,990
utilized they all been taken essentially

350
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,090
from the various which BP documents that

351
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,860
you can find the references the one that

352
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,230
we added is the distributed land support

353
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,229
that was added in version 3 which is a

354
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,360
new part that's being that's coming in

355
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,670
the work started initially for release

356
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,870
16 which is the current work in 3gpp for

357
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,640
the current specifications and there

358
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,459
will be more work in the circuit

359
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,290
released 17 which starts in October this

360
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:36,090
year at the level of specifications this

361
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,309
is an updated picture we have in the

362
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,899
draft on how do you recognize how do you

363
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,428
realize the actual applications over the

364
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
so-called transport convergence layer

365
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:46,290
which sits in between the app and the

366
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,360
actual dual ICN IP stack and they have

367
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,670
been some updates to the text on how the

368
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,169
this TCL works and makes the selection

369
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,870
of the actual packets to be routed

370
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:59,520
either over ICN over IP and there are

371
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:00,719
some updates in the draft and this most

372
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,340
of the artists have been oh they're

373
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,419
actually not updates oversimplifications

374
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,349
being made

375
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,089
on ICN over 5g lon we're and explaining

376
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,979
specifically the new interfaces which is

377
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:12,719
a so-called NX interface and it's called

378
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:15,029
NX because the switch PP didn't come up

379
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:17,459
with a number yet usually the the

380
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:20,070
interfaces have a number boring like and

381
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:21,929
four and six and nine whatever this one

382
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,619
is called NX because it has got a number

383
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:27,570
yet and the forwarding is that's this

384
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:30,119
being described there is one of the

385
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,649
ongoing piece of work in 3gpp on so

386
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,899
called using so-called pass based

387
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:35,458
forwarding over that new interface to

388
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:37,498
establish an end-to-end LAN connection

389
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:39,209
so the idea here is that instead of

390
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:40,950
having an IP Bearer on your cellular

391
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:43,379
device you would have a LAN Bearer on

392
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,570
your seller device and the actual lance

393
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,978
can be separated from each other so

394
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,769
therefore you might have a different

395
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:51,719
alarm for one application versus yet

396
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:54,299
another line for another application or

397
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:57,690
the the LAN separation obviously happens

398
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,339
between devices for instance the section

399
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,829
describes how the actual paths are being

400
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:04,168
set up and encoded between the ups ups

401
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:06,599
our user plain functions in a 5g system

402
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:07,889
or for like a better word if you if you

403
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,529
want to associated with its technology

404
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:12,119
very often their Sdn switches they're

405
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,859
usually slightly more complex in SD

406
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,629
inspectors but as a simplification and

407
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,119
that probably gives you an idea with a

408
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:19,859
UPF is it describes that the positive

409
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:21,718
news provides are bi-directional by

410
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:23,519
design so you can you know send you know

411
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:25,919
back and forth that's intentional

412
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm similar to alarm communication that

413
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,779
you would have as well as that several

414
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,429
pass identifiers can be combined into a

415
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,320
multicast model that's the part that's

416
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:35,669
currently being pushed into release 17

417
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,829
so that hasn't been and there's a note

418
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,570
in the text that describes dish based on

419
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:41,789
the last meeting value while we were

420
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,168
actually writing the draft we expect

421
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,450
that this solution possibly to be

422
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:46,799
adopted and released 16 it actually has

423
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,779
been pushed into the discussions from

424
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,179
release 17 so this is all worked as

425
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:53,459
ongoing in parallel to what's going on

426
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,229
in sweetie VP so the multicast has not

427
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:58,079
yet been agreed at the sweetie pp level

428
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:59,820
I mean probably a needle should make the

429
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,649
note a bit stronger in the graph to

430
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,689
describe says we also described in the

431
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,339
graph often how do you utilize the

432
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,309
pathways forwarding to send the packet

433
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,899
from one layer to seller device to yet

434
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,809
another one how does that work with a

435
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:16,708
generic packet structure described at

436
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:17,158
the bottom through the the MAC addresses

437
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:19,259
that of

438
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,119
being assigned to the devices at the

439
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:23,159
barrel level so once you once you're

440
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,109
attached to the device is very similar

441
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,029
to today's IP model you're you're

442
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,918
getting an IP I saw a MAC address

443
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:30,889
assigned rather an IP address and then

444
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,359
how is the actual forwarding at layer 2

445
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:37,199
being realized as described in the draft

446
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,728
as well the next steps we have is to

447
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,289
collect feedback from the ice energy in

448
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:42,629
particular on the changes there as I

449
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:44,908
said there is a difference in changes

450
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:46,769
some of them are editorial some the 5g

451
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,570
part has largely been update as mainly

452
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:51,119
updating following the specifications

453
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,799
the 5g LAN part is newer because the

454
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,109
ongoing work but to get comments from

455
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,789
the working group would be very useful

456
00:24:55,109 --> 00:25:00,830
to see where we are with that we also

457
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,450
with the author's felt that in

458
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,570
combination to the 4G traffic is already

459
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,070
a research group item we would like to

460
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,759
ask for adoption as a research group

461
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,470
item because of the jump to the 5g

462
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,929
technology if you were compared to the

463
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:19,349
41 and that then would make this

464
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:25,409
document a companion document to the LTE

465
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:27,809
4G draft arm that I mentioned before yes

466
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,419
indeed over just a process question so

467
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:32,099
I'm not a 5g expert but obviously if

468
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,710
actually a sanitization is still ongoing

469
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:37,590
yeah so what's your vision is then this

470
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,570
should be a living document I mean that

471
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,189
doesn't matter regarding and working

472
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,570
group adoption right we or research we

473
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,119
can adopt it and still have it as a

474
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:48,239
living document but do you want to have

475
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,580
it hanging on until 5g is done or or do

476
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:52,950
you do you foresee any major changes in

477
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,949
the 5g lon again I'm not an expert I'm

478
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,749
just so for the for the FRG Korca Texas

479
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,369
no this is I mean the update they also a

480
00:25:57,749 --> 00:26:01,349
minor it's relative so there were

481
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:02,639
updates to that part of the text I said

482
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:04,168
the five Jalan is a little bit of a

483
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:05,428
moving target at the moment because as I

484
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,499
said while we were writing and we were

485
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:09,690
actually expecting the multicast mode 5g

486
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,099
LAN at the moment really 16 is a LAN

487
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,509
tool on communication it doesn't

488
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,549
actually describe how to do multicast

489
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:16,109
which is slightly strange right but it

490
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,239
has been moved it's in a great topic

491
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:20,519
that's being moved to really 17 so for

492
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:22,859
that part yes I would agree us needing

493
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:29,810
to update this as be as we go along

494
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:33,949
you know indeed yeah

495
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,540
I'm a flame from a Nokia unfortunately I

496
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,320
haven't bred you're like this version of

497
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,659
the document

498
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,860
do you have considerations of this all

499
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:45,290
right let's see which is also

500
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:51,080
disgusting pretty any mappings for

501
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:52,250
instance to TSM no we left that at four

502
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,750
for two reasons I think there's a

503
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,840
relation yes indeed the one the reason

504
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,630
we left it out yes exactly

505
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,860
um the question be we could at this the

506
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,840
reason we didn't add it is because we

507
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,280
didn't want to have to moving targets in

508
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,830
a why because even the tears n is

509
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,690
equally fluid at the moment so we left

510
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:16,120
that out and basically focus on the

511
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:20,000
baseline line communication okay okay

512
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,610
so yeah this is one of the activities

513
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,270
that yeah I could help people to

514
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:30,290
understand how actually deploy I see em

515
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:33,650
in a particular network so it's but it's

516
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:38,810
it's it's kind of useful output of this

517
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:44,390
group so we are positive to this request

518
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:53,600
quick question who has read these to 5g

519
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:55,130
drafts or any of those yeah okay so in

520
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:01,600
this room is there is there any

521
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:01,600
objection regarding adopting this draft

522
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:13,820
just be when you concern

523
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:18,350
not so good time okay so as I said so we

524
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:21,020
ended general positive and the other

525
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:23,000
comments okay but thankful for for

526
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,830
tracking the 50 work and and doing this

527
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,820
yeah I mean one of the things we're

528
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,919
going to do definitely for the next

529
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,080
draft based on the feedback is to put

530
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,270
the clear notices to those pieces that

531
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,710
are actually being put into the than

532
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,720
your releases so we're going to do that

533
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,720
for the living document comment okay

534
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,640
blue sheets we have those can you

535
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,280
around there's more people that have

536
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:56,780
come if you want a bigger have a bigger

537
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:56,780
room next time peace solution okay

538
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,979
allocate sizes based upon how many means

539
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,550
are on the blue she did the previous

540
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:12,540
meeting so we should grab a few people

541
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:14,610
outside okay so this craft is a new

542
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,649
traffic but as I mentioned before this

543
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,300
came out of a notorious decision to

544
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,940
actually move parts of the previous

545
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,440
draft out into a separate one I'm so in

546
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,120
a way this is the second time the

547
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,440
content is being presented but the draft

548
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,600
itself is a new submission I don't think

549
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,210
there's any of my quarters here ICT is

550
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,439
here sorry yes he indeed is here so they

551
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,770
were later draft as I mentioned it's the

552
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,300
previous one and we took the in the

553
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,570
previous one in the previous version of

554
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,940
the previous draft the IP over ICN over

555
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,840
fifty line was a use case for the ICN

556
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,370
over five Jalan and I said we then but

557
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,689
there is the the overlap that we

558
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:56,310
utilized in this draft is to the 5 g 5g

559
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,040
core design principles of enough

560
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,500
repeating all of it we have a certain

561
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:04,590
recap of the 5g lon which is much

562
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,090
shorter than in the actual 5g traffic s

563
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:15,810
we don't want to repeat everything if

564
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:18,350
you will and we say so what we are

565
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:22,290
focusing on here is how to utilize

566
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:26,129
ability and implement actually IP over a

567
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,600
noisy ICN over for chillin over this

568
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,960
table Arrangements we describe news

569
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,699
cases in the draft I said the site of a

570
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,770
petitioner recap of the actual

571
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,890
realization of five Jalan in fact in the

572
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:39,360
five gene core network and then we focus

573
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:47,300
in the in the main part on the

574
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:47,300
realization of IP based services yeah hi

575
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:56,360
yes the ip-based services yes um it made

576
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,070
they title very very long to call it IP

577
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,479
based services device in fact you learn

578
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,889
but I could have done that the the

579
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:08,420
actual section is called IP based

580
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:12,440
services though I'm sorry they could be

581
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:14,900
yes so the question was whether we run

582
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,970
IP over an ICN or we want IP based

583
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,550
services yes the draft is called IP over

584
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,740
ICN for short the section is for a

585
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,810
reason called IP based services over ICN

586
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,780
of a party line I'm gonna agree with

587
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,460
John that it's misleading the this title

588
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,950
is misleading so I think include making

589
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,660
the name longer is okay okay good no we

590
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,640
do that well it was it was literally

591
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,140
just to keep the file name and

592
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,700
everything shorter I can make that clear

593
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,060
in the actual file name itself not a

594
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:44,210
problem so maybe we have the various

595
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,300
items in the section and then we do the

596
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,190
same as we've done in a change for the

597
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,980
ICN over five g12 that we linked to

598
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:55,820
these Roman considerations in a separate

599
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,430
section so I said in the recap we focus

600
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,290
particular on these two new interface at

601
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,180
the n6 interface it has a number so it

602
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,409
is a little bit older the NX interfaces

603
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,650
that new one that I was talking about

604
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:08,900
before so we discuss specifically how

605
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,940
these interfaces play a role in our

606
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,390
realization but to a large extent we you

607
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,010
refer back to the separate ICN over 5g

608
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,670
traffic in order to keep the section

609
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,740
shorter this relatively and a half hour

610
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,750
next on bullet item 1 which is hopefully

611
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,490
a little bit more useful and this rather

612
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,950
full picture shows on the left-hand side

613
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,120
if you can recognize that actual device

614
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,650
is talking to each other at the

615
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,389
application level on the left hand side

616
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,210
on the right hand side um you have a

617
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,790
forwarding structure in in the middle of

618
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,170
which east of 5g LAN network and at the

619
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,240
bottom we also talked about how to

620
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:44,180
indicate legacy devices that have a full

621
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,210
IP tcp/ip protocol stack over a so

622
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,220
called service proxy so in short we

623
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,080
describe with this alongside this

624
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,580
picture of how every internet IP based

625
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,530
service is interpreters the named

626
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,980
service transaction that is being routed

627
00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:00,050
over an ICN layer which is the ice in

628
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,360
vivace LAN layer that is described in a

629
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,070
separate raft how the broader caustic

630
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,370
flattens to the four layers being the

631
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,919
action

632
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,780
IP based services are long site not on

633
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,790
top of each other and the name based

634
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,440
routing together with the layer one and

635
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,139
layer two so that gives you the four

636
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,270
layers we then also describe the

637
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,160
interaction of the ice and layer with

638
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,720
the name resolver which you could see in

639
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,570
the previous picture it was somewhere in

640
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,030
that wild ask it wrong in the middle the

641
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,879
register I discover IP based services to

642
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:31,450
determine the actual intent a packet

643
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,220
forwarding information so in order to

644
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,020
retrieve actual path based forwarding

645
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,550
information you use the name resolver to

646
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,889
do that and it's that's been done for

647
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:42,169
differ for depending on what type of IP

648
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,300
based service you're considering the one

649
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,700
that we described in the draft are HTTP

650
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,399
services we also have a mapping for the

651
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,350
for for pure IP for pure IP level

652
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,770
services for anything that we can't map

653
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:56,570
for incident the HTTP level and and but

654
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,129
we haven't included that in the draft

655
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,439
and the question would be do we want to

656
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,660
do that we can do this and said the

657
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,910
interfaces to legacy devices and IP

658
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,920
based peering networks is established to

659
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,679
the service proxy devices which were at

660
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,060
the bottom of that picture and they

661
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,860
terminate a traditional internet

662
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,290
protocol stack and then communicate with

663
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:20,389
the the actual IP protocol stack based

664
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:21,889
devices the next step we this is an

665
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,950
initial draft it is longer than the

666
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,810
piece that we had included in the in the

667
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:28,460
joint raff the last time so it has

668
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,620
already more information than we had at

669
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,820
the last IDF but still obviously what we

670
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,888
are interested in is to collect feedback

671
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,840
from the ice energy not only only about

672
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:37,820
the name of the craft but also about

673
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,200
some of the operations I said one of the

674
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,490
questions we had is to we want to

675
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,189
include all of the mappings to be half

676
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:45,709
we have mapping so HTTP 4 over IP 4 coop

677
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,120
and for some other services do we want

678
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,220
to have them as separate sections at the

679
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:54,469
moment we only describe how to map HTTP

680
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:56,209
based services we also have a we have an

681
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,350
updated certain protocol details like

682
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,750
the flow management and the mobility

683
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:02,299
handling they are to be done for future

684
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:05,030
versions they are included as a section

685
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,210
but just for the editors note for future

686
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:10,700
versions and as a next step we also

687
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:14,180
intend to host the demo at the next ITF

688
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,549
in November to show the system a to show

689
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,029
running system for each type of for that

690
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:27,270
type of solution

691
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:36,570
good any questions I know Johnny have

692
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:38,759
tons but it's a lot for a comment which

693
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,710
is that ice cream I'm walking to this

694
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,030
color guy I think I would stick with the

695
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:46,230
HTT based services and the reason

696
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,930
roughly speaking is this I think that a

697
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,610
significant set of people in this in the

698
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,950
larger networking community outside of

699
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,460
this room can understand why that would

700
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,770
make sense

701
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,390
mm-hmm right they can so HTTP is kind of

702
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,370
an information transport protocol on top

703
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,440
of IP now I'm at the services enticing

704
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,600
that all feels really right I think if

705
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,230
you start at this moment in time

706
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,430
proposing to map IP directly over ice

707
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,020
tonight you are going to become the

708
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,540
subject of one of these famous t-shirts

709
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,220
where it's like the recursive 17 layer

710
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,300
said over layers thing and I I actually

711
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,299
don't think you should do that

712
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,920
okay good thanks it's kind of like the

713
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,780
reason that we used to put HTTP at the

714
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,800
moment in because it it also lines

715
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,330
spread over the use case I mean there

716
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,010
was a reasoning as well the use case if

717
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,080
you read the use case section they are

718
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,220
actually 82 feet use cases right and

719
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,779
there's the reason for it because it

720
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,459
becomes more blinding you're obvious why

721
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,500
you would do that all right the reason

722
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,880
we do IP is if you don't know anymore

723
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,070
what to do we just hand it to the IP

724
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,310
layer that's the reason we do the IP

725
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,260
mapping I think somebody comes was a and

726
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,120
we had we had a trial a couple of two

727
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,030
years ago where somebody allegedly did

728
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,560
HTTP but it turned out it was a

729
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,940
ready-made version of HTTP I mean just

730
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,220
handed straight back to the IP layer we

731
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,580
actually detect that and just give it to

732
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,480
IP and said okay and a lot of the

733
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,940
benefits that our scribe in the use

734
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:10,800
cases are not obviously visible if you

735
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:13,890
do that at the IP layer why do I think

736
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,930
Dave was caught other saying that while

737
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,600
you can do HTTP over I see and a lot of

738
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:23,279
the tricks that modern web pages - and

739
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,860
are not so easy over I said right Dave

740
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,140
remember oh I know the paper well well

741
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,760
so I'm just it's just a comment I mean

742
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,560
you're this is standardization so you

743
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,420
basically defining

744
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,520
but maybe you want to have a look at the

745
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,620
paper that reality a lot of the stuff

746
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,570
that we have on the web today it's not

747
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:44,850
so easy to do that was your conclusion

748
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:48,240
right Dave correct me if I'm wrong again

749
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:50,850
it's just I'm aware of the paper we can

750
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,049
put in yeah you know I'm a way up the

751
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:59,730
paper yeah so there's a difference

752
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:03,090
between easy to do and the you will not

753
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,980
like the end result so it's not so much

754
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:19,980
that it's hard to do it's that why would

755
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:22,110
you do this right services the other

756
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,390
question is what about the good

757
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,910
management and htps is there anything

758
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:30,450
that happens special they're super high

759
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:33,299
resolution and also for I was thinking

760
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,580
use PHP because both micro-services and

761
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,520
there is no Robert so micro-services may

762
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,080
be a different set of trainees

763
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,140
everything was announced felt was coop s

764
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,290
and co-op over which may close sense in

765
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,790
the i/o to use case so the the section

766
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,590
on secure that it was not analyst there

767
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,450
was an eg this section of security

768
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,970
consideration is to be filled as well so

769
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,529
that goes to the HTTPS one we actually

770
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,089
have a the question about the

771
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,850
microservices we have a draft in the

772
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:02,400
coin RG which is on Thursday where we

773
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:04,110
use this technology in the at the

774
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
terminal so with what's actual change

775
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,730
protocol stacks to do micro services

776
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,640
underneath monolithic applications so we

777
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,920
decompose Android apps just because we

778
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,069
don't only do Android for some reason we

779
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,010
decompose Androids up in real time and

780
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,690
establish micro services being being

781
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,050
delivered over this solution in a

782
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,550
terminal so that that does work and that

783
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,390
would be part of the demo eventually we

784
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,350
could be running in November so I found

785
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,040
stuff because I heard the word

786
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:38,160
standardization previous speaker and I

787
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,570
it isn't right this is a research draft

788
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,899
and I think actually it's a really

789
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:45,240
excellent question to say okay look we

790
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,760
know that HTTP is

791
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,959
and abused in and twisted beyond all

792
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,970
recognition it's a really interesting

793
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,190
question how well and how broadly the

794
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,149
mapping applies I think it's a good

795
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,980
research question okay thanks

796
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:03,690
yeah just as a comment from Jess I mean

797
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:07,110
the the HTTP mapping is that is not the

798
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:09,420
core part of the of of this work it's

799
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,930
certainly a good topic for for the

800
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:16,820
school to consider so how to do web /

801
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:18,660
ICN in general and and also address the

802
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,610
interesting challenges that the n for

803
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,649
example and I brought up but it's not a

804
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:28,110
core part of this document no no I mean

805
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:29,520
they say yeah I mean the for those of

806
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,630
you actually have been in the research

807
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,300
group for quite some time you presented

808
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,220
early work of this as early as 2015-2016

809
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,930
so this comes out of work that we've

810
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,000
actually tuned much more towards

811
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,950
standardized system so we had research

812
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,740
prototypes in 2015 I think that even

813
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,480
demonstrated to the cream and the reason

814
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,580
we lean more to you know what is

815
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,010
possible in 5g is because some of the

816
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,500
the design we utilize it's actually

817
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,420
being brought into 5g standardization

818
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,740
not every saying the HTTP mapping is it

819
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,000
and tried the API mapping is really

820
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,250
something that's much more related to

821
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,440
the ICN discussions which is why we we

822
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,180
have the discussions here but stuff

823
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,420
around five Jalan path based forwarding

824
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,640
etcetera is currently being poured into

825
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,560
five civilization might be very part of

826
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,819
running systems you know at some point

827
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,820
I'm good okay thank you to the demo in

828
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:39,630
okay okay so this is a CCNA food raft

829
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:43,070
update so this is a version currently

830
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,070
it's version 2

831
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:55,450
so this is a changes from version one to

832
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:57,869
version 2 thanks to Davis commenting a

833
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:01,769
mailing list we clarified server

834
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:05,410
communities the first one is doctors or

835
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:08,828
content hoarders there sometimes miss

836
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:10,899
you leading so I clarify the meaning of

837
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:13,000
louder's and the meaning of content

838
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,640
orders usually actually love does it

839
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,430
just a mission has a denote who has a

840
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,410
mission to pour the data and the interns

841
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:23,490
packet and the content order means that

842
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:26,069
it's a cash Lauda who cashed a

843
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,500
corresponding cache that is requested

844
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:32,440
via interest packet and the cash versus

845
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:36,460
aunt expired the cash so this is

846
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,609
something like a mix in a document so I

847
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:45,069
clarify the cash freeze just catch that

848
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:48,490
may be expired or may not be expired and

849
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:52,420
I expired caches as I as it says it's

850
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:55,899
not expect expired yet and the section 3

851
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,569
2 1 1 I changed the price at Brock this

852
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,779
is over thanks for the Deb's comment I

853
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:04,750
scale up the object size for the place a

854
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:08,289
Brock previously the content object size

855
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:12,309
was bite this body is a unit and now

856
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:16,930
it's the unit is kilobyte so totally

857
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:22,630
four point twenty nine terabyte can be

858
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:25,359
sivadas as a maximum in 32-bit field and

859
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,819
the counter for the refreshing the

860
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,328
counter so this is also there was no

861
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:34,538
discussion about if the status of the

862
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:36,220
refreshed contents so we add this

863
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:38,230
statement if the cache is refreshed

864
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,200
after reboot Jack Carter must be

865
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:43,359
refreshed must set so the counter must

866
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,519
set to zero and if the cache remains

867
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,119
after reboot check counter must not be

868
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,308
refreshed

869
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:51,519
which means must not must be kept at

870
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:54,640
ease and we also need to add this some

871
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:57,819
Ayane section but even though it's not

872
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,420
completed yet but we added the Ayane

873
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:02,590
section so this is just a leak a pub or

874
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,810
CCNA for

875
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,110
behavior so seasoning for user-initiated

876
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:10,960
requested me she's with request clock

877
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,850
and sends a message to last hop louder

878
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,460
and the last upload and as a lotta

879
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,850
passed inside the Aleppo prop in the

880
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:21,700
upper hop header and for the message

881
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:23,980
here message based on the the thieves in

882
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,710
hope I hope mana and the caching looters

883
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,170
who has a specify the content or force

884
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,540
up louder append reply block and repair

885
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,700
sub blocks to the message and sends a

886
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,680
message as a reply message towards the

887
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:40,569
scene if you use along the pit entry

888
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:43,919
this is a basic behavior so the default

889
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:48,070
behavior especially for the situation

890
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,760
the louder supporting the plotter

891
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,410
supports the mouths pass fifth some

892
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,330
louder may have strategy for multiple

893
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,250
falling when it sends interest message

894
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,680
to multiple neighbor routers it may

895
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:03,010
delay or prioritize to send a message to

896
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,859
the upstream loudest the seasoning

897
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,380
request as a default complies with such

898
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,450
strategy which means that CCNA for user

899
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,400
could tracer actual falling past based

900
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:16,149
on the foiling strategy so this is

901
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:21,130
something like a data playing trace but

902
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:23,080
we also add some compress situation we

903
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,520
call the full discovery request they

904
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,529
mean that there may be the case that

905
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,930
season four user wants to discover all

906
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,850
potential floating paths based on

907
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:35,259
louder's fib this means that it's not a

908
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:38,920
request any broadcast requests so the

909
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:41,890
feeb may have a multiple entries for

910
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,280
specific content but according to

911
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:48,730
strategy as I said it may be trade or

912
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,890
prioritize but if we if the seasoning

913
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:54,850
for user requests fully discovery

914
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:56,770
requests then if the fib hazard to enter

915
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:58,960
is for specify the content then the

916
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:02,890
request packet goes to the two or

917
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,970
multiple requests are much towards much

918
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:09,040
for forest now if our seasoning for user

919
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,020
sets the F frog in the request Park of

920
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,029
the request message to the request to

921
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,250
request the food discovery the upstream

922
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,130
louder's water request to the old mouth

923
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,550
perhaps room

924
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:21,200
based on the FIB simulation area then

925
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:22,760
the seasonal views I could trace all

926
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,250
potential boarding pass

927
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,840
note that some lot of may you know the

928
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,670
full discovery request according to a

929
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,070
policy in that case throughout our time

930
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:34,490
is a request this is a full discovery

931
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:36,350
situation when a season for user

932
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:38,089
requested a full discovery to receive

933
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,160
the different reprimands is for data

934
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:43,850
from different louder's pit entry

935
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,040
initiated by CCF info info remain until

936
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:49,009
the configure decision in Foley primers

937
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:53,779
passes so currently the required timeout

938
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:57,530
is set maybe I remember three seconds as

939
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,680
I do - sorry - torso please read a draft

940
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:02,300
two or three seconds as a default in

941
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,370
other words unlike the ordinary interest

942
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,290
data communication incision if the lot

943
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,240
accept a field full discovery request

944
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,100
that louder should not leave the pit

945
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:16,040
entry created by season in full request

946
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:18,170
until the timeout Part B expires so the

947
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,620
conclusion for at this moment season

948
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:23,840
which is compatible with CC + x/y/z one

949
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:27,529
TLB format but of course it's compatible

950
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:31,550
but we add several new packet type and

951
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:33,230
type values and it is a powerful network

952
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:37,640
tool providing various information

953
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:40,040
incision and the most important point of

954
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,830
this draft is that we need to have some

955
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,830
get some agreement on especially on mod

956
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:49,880
pass and security so these are the maybe

957
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:53,299
biggest issue so please read the draft

958
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,850
and give give us a comment it's really

959
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:59,300
welcome and the implementation is almost

960
00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:02,930
done in our open source implementation

961
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:07,490
c4 c4 is not only for seasoning for it's

962
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:11,750
really compatible with Metis folder so

963
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:15,259
we already tried the interoperability

964
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:18,320
test with Metis and it's a full set of

965
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:20,480
assisi and avoiding demo and the content

966
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,300
store so it's already included in a safe

967
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,880
or so if we are interested in please

968
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,170
access to the the safe for dotnet

969
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,859
website

970
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:33,650
ok that's all

971
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:33,650
thanks Akashi any questions or comments

972
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:40,979
this is pretty important work and it

973
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:47,190
really needs a lot more eyes on it from

974
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:49,379
people in the group I know I you know

975
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,989
III I haven't looked at it since the

976
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,700
last iteration right so I gave most of

977
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:56,369
my comments but I need to go through it

978
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,729
again I think we really ought to look at

979
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:02,519
one area that I think we ought to think

980
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:05,999
a lot about is the whole question of

981
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,649
flow balance and how we continue to

982
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:12,089
achieve flow balance with a scheme like

983
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:15,650
this and the second area is whether

984
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:18,959
doing things like this increases the

985
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:21,900
priority of adopting work around

986
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:23,969
multipath and paths hearing which has

987
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,190
been done in in papers in the academic

988
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:27,959
community but we don't have a and I see

989
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:30,150
an RG draft on path steering because

990
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:34,190
path steering and this sort of like as a

991
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:37,199
marriage that could be really well nice

992
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:40,499
so one of the other issues regarding

993
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:44,309
security is in the IP world you kind of

994
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:46,288
do the there are different caches of DNN

995
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:46,890
decided yet DNS usually decides which

996
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:49,259
one you use

997
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,269
and then the traceroute to do on the IP

998
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:52,859
layer just goes to one source right and

999
00:49:51,269 --> 00:49:55,379
here in the ICN word we have both

1000
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:58,440
intertwined as we know so one question

1001
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,630
from a security perspective is if I

1002
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,759
guess that you are asking for security

1003
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,789
comments right so one issue could be I

1004
00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:08,190
have to have to look at it closer and is

1005
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:11,609
that can you use this for discovery of

1006
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:13,469
caches and that you know maybe the ICN

1007
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:15,359
service provider doesn't want you to

1008
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,640
discover because usually routes to the

1009
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,920
other one or I mean then then he would

1010
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,420
probably block see see an info is he

1011
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,619
supposed to do that is he allowed to do

1012
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:30,390
that I don't know right right right

1013
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:32,430
you could always lie well but certain is

1014
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:35,640
peace have been gotten into big trouble

1015
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:37,499
for lying right regarding for instance

1016
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,799
of Comcast with peer-to-peer traffic and

1017
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:40,970
stuff so yeah you can always lie and

1018
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:45,290
usually

1019
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:46,879
he's always got a big dessert if they

1020
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:49,369
don't believe your keys then they won't

1021
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,520
why the FCC finds out you might get into

1022
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:54,109
trouble I'm just saying just a comment I

1023
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,430
mean these are things I think we need to

1024
00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:57,049
discuss thank you thank you

1025
00:50:55,430 --> 00:51:00,410
actually let me up level this just a

1026
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:05,650
second one of the things we discovered

1027
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:08,420
in in in dn with with discovery was that

1028
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:11,690
it was trivially easy for an attacker to

1029
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,250
do cash exploration right so ultimately

1030
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,950
the end the end people got rid of the

1031
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:19,910
features that the money to do cash

1032
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:22,939
exploration we won't want to reintroduce

1033
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:26,180
that problem by introducing CCM so

1034
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,520
whatever security is in CC info should

1035
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:35,868
not enable attacking consumers to do

1036
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:38,330
cash exploration I just want to

1037
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:40,220
reiterate that in this respect ICM this

1038
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,440
really different and this is different

1039
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,509
than traceroute because in the old world

1040
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,760
it was two different things and years

1041
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:49,190
intertwined but yeah this was exactly my

1042
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,020
problems yes right right there might be

1043
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,760
a simple solution here because you have

1044
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,520
enough info we have enough information

1045
00:51:52,760 --> 00:52:01,400
so that a cash would never return

1046
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:03,109
something that the producer wouldn't in

1047
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,960
other words if you send an intro at CCA

1048
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:09,020
info and something's in the cash it's

1049
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,369
relatively easy to ascertain whether the

1050
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,980
producer would have answered that

1051
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:14,570
question it might actually also be the

1052
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,369
case that in this case you would allow

1053
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:18,770
like us that we were joking but you

1054
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:20,780
might actually allow service providers

1055
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,369
not to answer CCA and for requests if

1056
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,810
they don't want to disclose other

1057
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:30,440
caching secrets right I think this is a

1058
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:33,619
longer off off of discussion but I think

1059
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,000
I want to be really careful about taking

1060
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:38,119
the position that you don't answer the

1061
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,220
query you may answer the query with not

1062
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,830
all the information that that would

1063
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:45,618
expose this but we've learned with trace

1064
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:47,598
RAL is that the refusal to answer a

1065
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:50,960
traceroute query and just drop it on the

1066
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:53,210
floor is really negative for debug

1067
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,080
ability of the network and we're trying

1068
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,190
to you know

1069
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,360
I don't think we want to replace Rhea

1070
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,950
sort of like go around the wheel again

1071
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,280
with what happened with traceroute and

1072
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:05,899
ISPs where they just dropped trace

1073
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,090
routes and refused to answer them rather

1074
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,280
than then figuring out how to allow

1075
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:13,880
trace routes to propagate and see the

1076
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:18,830
parts of the path that aren't sensitive

1077
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:20,510
right so we're just talking about the

1078
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:23,270
extension you call full path discovery

1079
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:25,250
right we're not talking about the core

1080
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,870
mechanism I think because the core

1081
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:31,520
mechanism just answers with one cache

1082
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:33,350
and yeah so there's this is a really

1083
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,690
good area for people to be looking at

1084
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:39,380
and suggesting what the right security

1085
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:43,130
versus manageability trade-offs are but

1086
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:45,260
full discovery is not broadcast so who

1087
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:48,830
even though you get to some answer from

1088
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:51,470
full discovery that both or multiple

1089
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:53,930
replies must be legal because the feeble

1090
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:59,870
already coordinated just according to

1091
00:53:53,930 --> 00:54:02,600
the strategy some of the past is

1092
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:05,630
prioritize and the secondary or Sadri

1093
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,270
they are just prior to lower priority so

1094
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:11,980
anyway so the full discovery is not

1095
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:15,680
again it's not broadcast it's not a true

1096
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:17,660
Wow the broadcast discovery so it's a

1097
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,230
coordinating to discovery but the

1098
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:23,210
strategy may not let's say something

1099
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:26,090
like ignore such kind of a

1100
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:28,880
prioritization may be ignored so this is

1101
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:30,710
a difference but anyway mister thanks

1102
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,630
for your great comment it's really

1103
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,870
interesting but also a several

1104
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,880
discussion about the security sled or

1105
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:40,880
something like access control and so we

1106
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,310
already mentioned slightly mention in a

1107
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,930
drafter so please read the draft and we

1108
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,600
are really happy to get you your comment

1109
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:50,690
again thank you yeah especially since we

1110
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,220
got the base specs for City NX out of

1111
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:55,540
the door and also really really good

1112
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:59,839
time to rent up activities on tooling

1113
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:02,320
this one question on C for us so you

1114
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:05,960
mention it it's it operates with Metis

1115
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:07,370
it's a interpolate with Medus yes we try

1116
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,080
to some

1117
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:13,790
test for the interoperability with a

1118
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:16,670
Metis okay so holy I mean if you can

1119
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:19,100
confirm that maybe also later whether

1120
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:22,070
it's actually compatible I she complies

1121
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,620
to the cnx MRC's that would be good to

1122
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:27,170
know and we could mention that on our

1123
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:32,450
wiki page well yeah I already mentioned

1124
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:34,820
in a weak page fantastic thanks Duchess

1125
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:38,419
okay okay okay

1126
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:43,300
thank you thanks a lot so we are

1127
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:46,010
switching gears to IOT and no power

1128
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,930
networks and promises going give us an

1129
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,810
update yeah something completely

1130
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:54,049
different this is actually a story

1131
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:57,259
that's going on for a while and I just

1132
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:59,060
took just said it wouldn't be better to

1133
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,270
give a brief recap on what this actually

1134
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:05,330
is about I don't have slides for this

1135
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:09,500
but so I'm doing this hand waving Lee if

1136
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:11,660
you look at low power lossy networks in

1137
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,400
the IOT of constraint devices that

1138
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,500
operate on batteries and you have

1139
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,640
different link layers like for instance

1140
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:25,970
IDO 2.15 for Bluetooth Low Energy or you

1141
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:29,029
have this w pan things like Laura and

1142
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:31,180
and stuff so these these wireless

1143
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:33,950
technologies have the property that they

1144
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:36,080
have that they are very constrained in

1145
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:40,129
several ways they can only send a very

1146
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,069
low rate of packets the the maximum

1147
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:47,660
transfer unit size is pretty low so ada

1148
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:50,240
2.11 there's 120 27 by its including the

1149
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:54,440
layer 2 header so this is all different

1150
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:57,169
from the common picture we have from

1151
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,120
fixed networks big pipes that are

1152
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:02,150
interconnected and where you can

1153
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:06,890
actually do a lot of complex operations

1154
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:09,980
without doing any harm and to to adapt

1155
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:12,440
the IP role to this there's a lot of a

1156
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:15,110
lot of work has been done and is still

1157
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:19,160
ongoing in several groups the most

1158
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:20,490
prominent was the 6lowpan adaptation

1159
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:26,089
layer that that

1160
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:29,250
the IP ipv6 world - ADA - got 15-4 and

1161
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:33,570
if you want so this is the correspondent

1162
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:37,200
work for ICN which is in some in some

1163
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:39,960
cases pretty similar or even just

1164
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,939
transverse the concept one to one so it

1165
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,480
doesn't reinvent them and there are a

1166
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:49,230
couple of things in this draft that that

1167
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,619
is very specific to - in the end SEC and

1168
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:57,390
India and it addresses both so what is

1169
00:57:52,619 --> 00:58:01,140
rather generic well generic is that if

1170
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:03,390
you if you are in a 15.4 network you

1171
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,310
need to tell the layer - because it

1172
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:08,940
doesn't have a type field or a payload

1173
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:11,279
type field you need to tell the the the

1174
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,460
receiving node that reads the layer -

1175
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,530
what actually what is the protocol so

1176
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:18,690
this is done via a dispatch field in in

1177
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:22,650
6lowpan so we extend this dispatch field

1178
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:27,510
to address that there's Indian or CCN

1179
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:29,130
coming and not ipv6 then there's a stent

1180
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:31,560
more or less standard fragmentation

1181
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:37,619
mechanism that fragments larger chunks

1182
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:40,920
onto these small small empty.you sizes

1183
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:44,570
that is more or less straightforward to

1184
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:47,280
transfer to Indian as well and then

1185
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:50,099
there are a lot of mechanisms that relay

1186
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:54,660
to compression to make the transfer of

1187
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:59,460
of packets or of data chunks more

1188
00:58:54,660 --> 00:59:01,980
efficient and these these compression

1189
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,680
mechanisms address headers

1190
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,900
I'm not data we are not looking at at

1191
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,390
entropy encoding of data or so that's

1192
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,210
not not the case here but we're looking

1193
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:17,160
at headers and trying to to reduce the

1194
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:20,070
header sizes in the most versatile way

1195
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,649
versatile means getting getting the

1196
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:25,349
things small but do it in a way that it

1197
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:27,300
is not addressing every narrow corner

1198
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:31,920
case making the thing extremely complex

1199
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:33,710
but being very useful for let's say 80

1200
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,539
90 percent of the cases

1201
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:44,029
and that's where we are actually in and

1202
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:46,309
this is what this graph does and this in

1203
00:59:44,029 --> 00:59:48,859
the middle of the disk of more or less

1204
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:52,640
converging discussion so we had two

1205
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:55,160
updates since the last time one updates

1206
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,769
last time was last presentation here was

1207
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,259
proc one update was from version to

1208
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:03,348
version 3 on the the the other one is

1209
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:07,940
from version 3 to version 4 so what did

1210
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:14,269
we do in this in this first the the key

1211
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:18,609
discussion that was around was first on

1212
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:23,589
on the on the way how to encode timers

1213
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:26,839
time tier V section and the second was

1214
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:33,410
how can we sort of even simplify the

1215
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:36,140
scheme to by just not not taking and

1216
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:39,618
taking or accounting for exceptions that

1217
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:44,529
are more or less not so important so

1218
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:47,779
what do we do first we editorial staff

1219
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:53,739
Tory stuff also quite a number of just

1220
01:00:47,779 --> 01:00:57,950
writing and clarifying and then we we we

1221
01:00:53,739 --> 01:01:02,839
selected the the time TF our values that

1222
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:04,808
was a we also simplified the the way and

1223
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:07,759
how the compression works and here's

1224
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:12,160
some details so the idea with the time

1225
01:01:07,759 --> 01:01:16,849
TF how is borrowed from from an lopen RC

1226
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:19,460
that's basically the idea to have to

1227
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:23,509
compress the time values into water pipe

1228
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:26,359
and the by it should should be able to

1229
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:31,430
cover with decent ranges of numbers so

1230
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:33,470
ranges up to days but not but at the

1231
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,660
price of granularity so you can't

1232
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:39,980
express any now every number but you you

1233
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:42,529
express like many numbers in the small

1234
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,079
range and and fewer numbers and the

1235
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:45,819
large range this is done by an encoding

1236
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:48,400
using

1237
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:50,380
exponent and mantissa and then using an

1238
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,150
exponential representation it is written

1239
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:56,949
on the slides here and you get you get

1240
01:01:54,150 --> 01:02:01,390
things that are that are in these ranges

1241
01:01:56,949 --> 01:02:08,069
of sub milliseconds to 45 days the point

1242
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:10,779
here or the the thing that was actually

1243
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:13,150
on the discussion here is that you if

1244
01:02:10,779 --> 01:02:14,920
you compress an arbitrary number in this

1245
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,890
way then you can't recover the number

1246
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,440
exactly you kind of if the number is not

1247
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:25,868
representable in this way then you are

1248
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:29,259
actually you need to round to round to

1249
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:31,839
the nearest or nearest largest larger

1250
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:34,209
number which is actually in the draft

1251
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:36,819
now we had a discussion whether we

1252
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:38,680
wanted to safe also whether we wanted to

1253
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:41,650
actually change the whole timer system

1254
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:44,140
in in CCM but just actually didn't and

1255
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:45,549
that was a bit too late i guess i was

1256
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:48,038
definitely too late for the current

1257
01:02:45,549 --> 01:02:50,890
specs but since we're going to start

1258
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:52,900
opening up this i think this is high

1259
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:57,729
high on the list of things we might want

1260
01:02:52,900 --> 01:03:00,609
to do right so for any any any time

1261
01:02:57,729 --> 01:03:04,118
values in CC n x that aren't inside the

1262
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:08,199
security envelope we'd be able to

1263
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:10,930
compress them this way and that for most

1264
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:12,729
of the uses of timers in CC n it has the

1265
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:15,308
again the nice property that this

1266
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:17,288
exploits which is that the the longer

1267
01:03:15,309 --> 01:03:21,910
the time the less precision you need in

1268
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:26,559
the actual time things stay you know are

1269
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:29,199
being measured so it this is something

1270
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:33,849
we'll discuss as perhaps being done

1271
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:35,709
globally further all the specs I just

1272
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:37,569
wanted to mention that this problem is I

1273
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:39,308
mean well known and older this is the

1274
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:48,069
same as floating point numbers I Triple

1275
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:50,199
E so it's really important for you you

1276
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:52,329
have to round and of course the problem

1277
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:55,569
is that you have to recalculate check

1278
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:57,190
sums if you can't recover them if it's

1279
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:59,089
inside the security envelope and you

1280
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,519
can't recover the original number then

1281
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:04,400
have to recalculate checksums that which

1282
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:07,430
is just not so right so would be better

1283
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,670
if the the uncompressed representation

1284
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,989
was actually minimum you know minimal so

1285
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:16,069
it doesn't have to be separately

1286
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:18,739
compressed I'm not aware of use cases

1287
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:21,950
were actually this range of numbers is

1288
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:25,660
is clearly insufficient because I'm I'm

1289
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:30,759
not sure whether you really need 43

1290
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:33,379
blabla days time to live value or or a

1291
01:04:30,759 --> 01:04:35,029
so something like this I mean the one

1292
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,069
that it would be the Delta for

1293
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:39,049
expiration over current time right

1294
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:41,989
because data expiration might very

1295
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:47,329
easily be longer than 45 days hmm right

1296
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:50,809
but all the rest won't look at it look

1297
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:54,229
at it okay that's the one so and the

1298
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:58,190
second is the the state compression

1299
01:04:54,229 --> 01:05:00,558
scheme is is built in a way that we are

1300
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:03,170
trying to Eli trying to cut out a lot of

1301
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:07,759
type and length values from the TLV

1302
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:12,349
encoding and this is by fixing fixing in

1303
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:15,799
order and fixing certain types and that

1304
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:18,619
is that the scheme gets more complicated

1305
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:22,849
if you give you give more freedom to the

1306
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:25,219
to the to what you encode and there was

1307
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:26,989
one discussion on op limits in in the

1308
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:30,079
end in the end has an optional hop

1309
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:32,869
limited it's not mandatory and if you

1310
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,359
want to to n cope encoding optional hop

1311
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:37,670
limits then it actually blows the thing

1312
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:41,869
a little bit up so we actually decided

1313
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:44,119
to say okay we always we assume there is

1314
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:46,999
a hop limit and if there is no hop limit

1315
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:49,249
then we can just insert a 255 which is a

1316
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:53,589
maximum up limit size that doesn't do

1317
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:55,879
harm and and and then we don't need to

1318
01:05:53,589 --> 01:06:01,479
deal with the case that that there is no

1319
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:04,249
hop limit and if the same as we also we

1320
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:07,339
assume the hop announces present and

1321
01:06:04,249 --> 01:06:09,390
then we can actually fix the order and

1322
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:12,150
then we can use that

1323
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:13,739
if if an interest lifetime is there then

1324
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:16,380
we can actually use it from the header

1325
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:21,749
length because it's a remaining the

1326
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:24,599
remaining bytes and the one that time

1327
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:27,390
tre encoding is is I already mentioned

1328
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:30,900
and the same is a little bit for the

1329
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:34,049
data so we if we fix the order we can

1330
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:36,630
actually once again be used at last the

1331
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:39,059
last field and that's a fresh freshness

1332
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,470
period this is optional if it's there we

1333
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:44,450
see it from the header length and if

1334
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:47,759
it's not and the header is exhausted and

1335
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:50,609
in in the cases I mean that's always the

1336
01:06:47,759 --> 01:06:52,589
format in the cases where all these

1337
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:54,839
schemes don't apply softens the

1338
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:58,349
freshness period cannot be converted to

1339
01:06:54,839 --> 01:07:00,599
the to the TV or whatever then we can

1340
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:03,119
always fall back to sending uncompressed

1341
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,999
data so that is that's always in a

1342
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:10,259
fallback that is not not efficient but

1343
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:17,069
compatible to everything that's that's

1344
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:20,400
like the the escape Ian of course the

1345
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:22,470
objective is to hit most of the cases to

1346
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,049
be to be applicable in most of the cases

1347
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:31,890
so the second update we had is very

1348
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:35,579
recent that is we had a room GL I can't

1349
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:37,859
really pronounce the name sanchow had

1350
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:42,170
kindly provided a thorough review to

1351
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:44,220
before the version 3 and while we we had

1352
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:46,499
discussions on the list we also had

1353
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,950
offline discussions on some details with

1354
01:07:46,499 --> 01:07:51,450
him there was a number of things

1355
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:52,799
stressful to straighten out and this is

1356
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:55,200
numerated here and there's one

1357
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:57,660
discussion point left which I bring to

1358
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,029
the group on the next slide so he

1359
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:02,640
addressed a couple of things so this was

1360
01:08:00,029 --> 01:08:04,829
a actually a mistake to have it digest

1361
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:08,970
at the data compression at the data

1362
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:12,420
airport he pointed out which was a very

1363
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:15,569
smart point out pointing out that the

1364
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:17,819
forwarding hints could also work with a

1365
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:22,979
TLV compression scheme that actually

1366
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:25,500
applies for the names so we added this

1367
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:29,040
then we had some adaption on the newest

1368
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:32,760
versions of ndn there was a parameter

1369
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:37,140
renamed application parameter we adopted

1370
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:42,590
this that's minor details here was also

1371
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:45,240
an editorial thing then there was I mean

1372
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:47,490
was the point that actually in the end

1373
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:50,120
is a is a moving target as you call it

1374
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:52,760
as Mustaine geing and we sort of

1375
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:56,149
clarified that we are addressing certain

1376
01:08:52,760 --> 01:09:00,300
specifications and if actually things

1377
01:08:56,149 --> 01:09:02,160
move away in the nd inspect then this

1378
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,170
document cannot handle it and then it

1379
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:07,950
needs to be either uncompressed or a

1380
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:10,980
future version needs to do it the the

1381
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:12,779
discussion point here is actually and we

1382
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:15,629
I wanted to bring this to the to this

1383
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:18,809
group is the question about compressing

1384
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:21,510
names so we always assume that we have

1385
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:25,860
all name components of the type generic

1386
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:28,500
name that means it's it's opaque and the

1387
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:30,509
end forces the the the option to have

1388
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,340
type names so for instance you could

1389
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:37,800
have part of the name being a

1390
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:40,380
temperature with some some semantics and

1391
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:43,560
some syntax or being something I don't

1392
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:47,040
know some counter or some of a certain

1393
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,320
length this has not been addressed in

1394
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,210
the draft and actually we are not really

1395
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:56,880
excited about addressing this because it

1396
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:58,920
makes it complicated so but the question

1397
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,870
was raised

1398
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,510
should this be incorporated should

1399
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:06,630
should this be addressed in this word or

1400
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:11,490
shouldn't it I mean it's a trade-off I

1401
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:14,400
mean just understand if there would be

1402
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:16,559
such thing as a gateway from Indian to

1403
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,210
this format you would just go you would

1404
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,390
lose that information right but that

1405
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:23,460
would still be possible well now in I

1406
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:25,860
mean crudely I would be if you have

1407
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:27,180
typed name components that we couldn't

1408
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:29,759
compress them so we would send

1409
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,860
uncompress so the whole compression

1410
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,210
scheme what would only address this

1411
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,210
generic name components

1412
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,159
well this is what we do what we do

1413
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,400
currently so we have right so yeah who's

1414
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,379
that

1415
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,789
well you can't lose the information

1416
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:50,749
because when the data packet comes back

1417
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:53,219
you won't be able to check the signature

1418
01:10:50,749 --> 01:11:00,300
no no we are not losing the information

1419
01:10:53,219 --> 01:11:03,269
we are generic name component and that's

1420
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:06,719
so we don't transform it transmitted but

1421
01:11:03,269 --> 01:11:08,789
if we want to handle different kind of

1422
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,530
types in the name components and we

1423
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:14,070
can't just delight the type because we

1424
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:16,110
are wise you can't recover it so we have

1425
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,570
an eye on a registry of types for CCN

1426
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:21,900
yeah

1427
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:29,549
a few of them we expect to be widely

1428
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:30,900
used for example chunk number so it may

1429
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:33,239
be worth going through the Ayana

1430
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:38,308
registry and for things we expect to see

1431
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:42,419
a lot have a fixed compression for those

1432
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:43,860
I mean I see the problem where if if you

1433
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,440
want to be able to compress something

1434
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:48,839
where you where any you know the type is

1435
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,239
you don't know anything about about the

1436
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,820
types right you're gonna lose a lot of

1437
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:57,150
compression in attempt to carry the type

1438
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,799
information opaquely right now so there

1439
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:01,348
may be a compromise here where there

1440
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:05,940
there are you know how many types are in

1441
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:08,130
the registry now like 2 3 maybe 4 and of

1442
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,469
those maybe only we can talk about which

1443
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:14,190
ones we actually expect to see commonly

1444
01:12:10,469 --> 01:12:16,679
used and we can you know we you can do

1445
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:19,949
you know constant dictionary

1446
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:23,999
you know static Dictionary compression

1447
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:25,320
of the types that we expect to see I had

1448
01:12:23,999 --> 01:12:27,539
one a quick question when you say we

1449
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,130
don't compress do you lose all the

1450
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:32,030
compression of everything or only the

1451
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,030
compression of the name

1452
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:41,630
but I don't want to answer this

1453
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,729
generally I mean their parts in the

1454
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:45,919
draft where you can leave yeah because

1455
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:47,479
there's there's coupling there okay it's

1456
01:12:45,919 --> 01:12:51,639
a bit complicated I mean I don't want to

1457
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:53,900
say it's something wrong yeah so okay my

1458
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:55,820
my opinion for what it's worth is that

1459
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:57,438
we should deal with the types we expect

1460
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:04,369
to be widely used and not worry about

1461
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:06,380
the general case okay yeah so we can can

1462
01:13:04,369 --> 01:13:08,179
take a take a look and we can maybe also

1463
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:10,039
exchange some people should weigh in on

1464
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:12,860
this however yeah of course I mean

1465
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:15,860
feedback solicited and we can maybe also

1466
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:31,308
exchange some experience with mark on

1467
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:34,610
that yeah hi mark mark Moscow yeah yeah

1468
01:13:31,309 --> 01:13:37,159
we're not you know when I had done the

1469
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:39,018
compression for CC necks before you know

1470
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:40,848
which was unrelated to your draft you

1471
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:43,669
know I I used a dictionary approach

1472
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:45,919
where you set up state between hmm you

1473
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:48,260
know the the received you know each hop

1474
01:13:45,919 --> 01:13:50,389
along the path would have state from the

1475
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:54,260
previous hostage oh that's a state from

1476
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:55,909
yeah it's a staple yeah but but there

1477
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:59,239
are you know the other thing is you can

1478
01:13:55,909 --> 01:14:03,499
exploit is lengths for name components

1479
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:08,949
usually are kind of short so I was able

1480
01:14:03,499 --> 01:14:12,169
to combine the type into the length bits

1481
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:15,138
okay so I would say oh I just have four

1482
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:17,239
bits for type and you know four bits for

1483
01:14:15,139 --> 01:14:19,699
length or something you know not exactly

1484
01:14:17,239 --> 01:14:22,968
this but you know I was able to put some

1485
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:25,699
amount of type information in there

1486
01:14:22,969 --> 01:14:26,510
or if you have repeating fields you know

1487
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:28,638
you could set up just a little

1488
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:31,099
self-contained dictionary and in your

1489
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,749
heart of the compression so I mean

1490
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:34,669
they're actually two two ways to do this

1491
01:14:32,749 --> 01:14:37,188
I mean the this draft also addresses

1492
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:39,439
stateful compression but not for the

1493
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:41,179
names now so we could could include this

1494
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,429
interstate full compression the the

1495
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:45,969
emini types I mean even leave this

1496
01:14:43,429 --> 01:14:49,030
approach for the generic and then if you

1497
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:49,030
they are

1498
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:54,380
type name components and put this into

1499
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:57,889
stateful compression the other will be

1500
01:14:54,380 --> 01:15:00,409
like to to squeeze this if it's having

1501
01:14:57,889 --> 01:15:02,270
some I mean here's only the length of

1502
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:06,559
the of the overall name and then you

1503
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:09,610
have I mean no type no component length

1504
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:13,489
and and stop it so that's actually

1505
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:17,570
that's very very much compressed so you

1506
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:25,309
could be some some something in between

1507
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:27,590
yeah yeah look over the draft again for

1508
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:29,900
I mean for names usually you have enough

1509
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:34,219
repetition between all the different

1510
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:36,739
names in the packet that just doing a

1511
01:15:34,219 --> 01:15:40,580
teeny dictionary at the start

1512
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:42,799
hmm you know would let you do arbitrary

1513
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:47,300
compression but still get a lot of

1514
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:49,520
compression man kind of related to this

1515
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:53,900
was discussion kept yesterday in the

1516
01:15:49,520 --> 01:16:00,230
6lowpan group we were talking about long

1517
01:15:53,900 --> 01:16:02,420
addresses for ipv6 and using prefixes

1518
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:05,119
having essentially gateways that add

1519
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:09,199
prefixes or drop programmers not exactly

1520
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:15,559
nats yeah I know so you could apply the

1521
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:17,570
same concept for names this is a

1522
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:21,199
stateful compression of 6lowpan yeah and

1523
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:23,769
we also only yeah this actually exists

1524
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:26,449
here too so we have we already have this

1525
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:28,400
state for compression of common prefixes

1526
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:31,009
here which is that's more or less

1527
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,519
straightforward translation so you just

1528
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:38,420
cut the cut the prefix that is common to

1529
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:43,190
the communication and then you you you

1530
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:46,639
fix it at the nodal state yeah but here

1531
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:48,530
would it would be something like what I

1532
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:50,570
guess what mark means is so it would be

1533
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:53,989
something like we have a name that is

1534
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:57,019
built of component type 1 type 2 type 3

1535
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:58,728
and this name repeats so we can say this

1536
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:02,269
we have of

1537
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:05,149
name type five or so and this has this

1538
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:07,399
structure so we we note that we are

1539
01:17:05,149 --> 01:17:11,090
actually communicating it at five name

1540
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:12,889
and then we can write down the

1541
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:14,570
compressed format so what what mark says

1542
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:17,179
basically is that the names are not

1543
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:22,849
arbitrary but they follow some logic so

1544
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:28,209
I mean the structure of the name of

1545
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:32,689
course yeah okay yeah okay so we

1546
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:34,489
straighten this out otherwise we're we

1547
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:39,739
believe that this is more or less

1548
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:43,549
maturity and yeah thanks I hang this has

1549
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:47,239
evolved quite nicely and it's also

1550
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:53,570
really important work to be honest who's

1551
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:59,148
interested in IOT and and ICN rather

1552
01:17:53,570 --> 01:18:02,360
that's more of you so who has read the

1553
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:06,760
latest version of this draft not the

1554
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:11,299
latest but the one before so a version

1555
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:15,079
okay okay so there are two things so one

1556
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:19,760
is we want to obey the outcome of the

1557
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:22,518
name component discussion yeah and but

1558
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:25,399
second is it would be good to get a few

1559
01:18:22,519 --> 01:18:28,599
more eyes on this on this draft so maybe

1560
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:33,260
somebody who maybe hasn't read it yet

1561
01:18:28,599 --> 01:18:35,090
could have a dog who's fresh eyes so

1562
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:38,389
that we just do some quality assurance

1563
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:41,889
in the group here can we get a volunteer

1564
01:18:38,389 --> 01:18:41,889
for for viewing this

1565
01:18:46,050 --> 01:19:08,730
I think that doesn't have an optimal

1566
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:15,389
logarithmic encoding so it's not

1567
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:17,218
sufficient but that's probably still

1568
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:22,070
okay right because we won't have to the

1569
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:28,110
discussion anyway okay great thank you

1570
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:29,759
so just one additional comment so so

1571
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:37,110
Tomas didn't mention it because I'm

1572
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:39,420
super modest and a nice guy but so this

1573
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:42,449
is really interesting work in a sense

1574
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:45,270
because it really demonstrates the

1575
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:47,519
usefulness of ICN so there's other work

1576
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:50,400
well that team that you know

1577
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:54,570
demonstrates all the nice properties in

1578
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:59,159
terms of robustness performance and so

1579
01:19:54,570 --> 01:20:03,808
on so comparing ICN our lopen networks

1580
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:05,759
was like IP based stacks and the

1581
01:20:03,809 --> 01:20:07,590
reliance if I may say so are really

1582
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,920
really promising so this is really one

1583
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:15,210
one area where I see and really shines

1584
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:18,540
and so that's also why we want to get

1585
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:23,690
this out and publish this as a one of

1586
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:27,480
our next specifications okay thank you

1587
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:36,900
and we're moving on with name resolution

1588
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:42,869
and having drama on stage and who hasn't

1589
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:44,860
signed the gooshie get a very good thank

1590
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:47,880
you

1591
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:47,880
[Music]

1592
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:58,720
okay hello everyone I'm Chong Chong from

1593
01:20:55,510 --> 01:21:03,160
a tree this is the update on NRS

1594
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:07,990
document we have a to an arrest document

1595
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:12,010
which is adopted after ITF 102 and one

1596
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:14,980
is requirements for NRS in ICN and the

1597
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:19,840
other is architectural consideration of

1598
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:22,990
ICN using NRS the first one had the

1599
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:27,250
title of the first one has changed it in

1600
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:31,660
to design guidelines the reason why we

1601
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:34,120
change it when when we say requirement

1602
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:36,820
it is too strong and also the things

1603
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:41,470
that we have described in the trap well

1604
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:44,019
you cannot qualify or require you can

1605
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:46,090
omit all the requirements in one system

1606
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:49,210
so it was too strong

1607
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:51,340
so we change it into the design

1608
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:53,500
guidelines so which means that these are

1609
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:59,380
things that you can consider when you

1610
01:21:53,500 --> 01:22:01,450
design the NRS for your sister so the

1611
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:05,380
first one design guidelines for energy

1612
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:08,620
in IC and this is the zero 2 version we

1613
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:10,840
haven't changed the name file name yet

1614
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:12,940
so it has the requirements in it but

1615
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,270
next time we'll change it into the

1616
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:22,389
guidelines and we have about six authors

1617
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:26,070
and this document focuses on NRS itself

1618
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:30,910
as a service or as a system in ICN and

1619
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:34,929
this Tucanos defines what is NRS in ICN

1620
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:37,389
we also capitalized the NL's approaches

1621
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:41,080
and also provides the comparison of the

1622
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:43,810
each among the the approaches we

1623
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:47,230
provides the functionality of the NRS in

1624
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:50,530
ICS which is which includes how analyst

1625
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:53,919
is used in different ICN architectures

1626
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:57,820
we provides the design guidelines as

1627
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:03,710
well for NRS as well as the security

1628
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:05,809
considerations on the left side is the

1629
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:12,170
previous version the right side is the

1630
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:17,600
current version on the section three we

1631
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:21,950
have we originally we had the analysis

1632
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:24,140
of the analyst approaches before but in

1633
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:26,660
the lab in the previous version we

1634
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:30,380
removed it because we concentrated on D

1635
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:32,599
and that is a system itself but somehow

1636
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:34,730
we had a discussion among the authors

1637
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,890
that we better to help these approaches

1638
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:40,129
back so we put it back in there

1639
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:43,340
so let me enter explain a little bit

1640
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:44,960
about the what these approaches are the

1641
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:48,080
first exploitive name resolution

1642
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,920
approach is there is that you have the

1643
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:55,330
name resolution service system as

1644
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:59,780
standalone in your architecture and

1645
01:23:55,330 --> 01:24:02,840
that's mostly user way and the second

1646
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:05,540
lane based routing approach is like a

1647
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:08,960
CCN and in the end you do the hop-by-hop

1648
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:11,870
them resolution when you for the

1649
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:17,180
interest packets and the third is a

1650
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:19,580
hybrid of of those two and then we have

1651
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:25,180
we give some comparison up to those

1652
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:30,440
approaches in section subsection 3.0 and

1653
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:34,190
section 4 it was the originally way back

1654
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:36,650
it was started from motivation of NRS

1655
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:38,450
and then we changed it to the objectives

1656
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:42,440
and now we change it to the

1657
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:47,630
functionality so these are things is how

1658
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:49,849
LS can be utilized in in ICN so and also

1659
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:51,890
we had the use cases before but we

1660
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:55,370
integrate this use case into the

1661
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:58,190
functional each functionalities so and

1662
01:24:55,370 --> 01:25:01,010
also in for this revision we added

1663
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:05,030
another functionality which is the

1664
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:09,410
supporting metadata I explained in the

1665
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:12,759
next slides about it and regarding to

1666
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:16,639
change the title obviously to section 5

1667
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,219
title is design guidelines which is the

1668
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:20,460
main

1669
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:24,559
a contribution of the distal comment and

1670
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:28,409
before when we had the requirements we

1671
01:25:24,559 --> 01:25:32,099
categorized it in terms of the service

1672
01:25:28,409 --> 01:25:35,339
aspect and system and security aspect

1673
01:25:32,099 --> 01:25:38,909
before when we integrate the service and

1674
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:42,289
system aspect into the guidelines and we

1675
01:25:38,909 --> 01:25:45,289
separate this security aspect to the

1676
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:51,809
individual section out to these security

1677
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:56,159
considerations so this is the major

1678
01:25:51,809 --> 01:25:59,670
taste for this current version I really

1679
01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:02,728
explained that the title has been

1680
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:05,789
changed and subsection object has been

1681
01:26:02,729 --> 01:26:07,849
changed it to functionalities and also

1682
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:10,768
use case integrated into the

1683
01:26:07,849 --> 01:26:14,460
functionalities and the support metadata

1684
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:17,130
is you you give the name to the NRS

1685
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:20,099
system and the entire system returns a

1686
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:23,159
set of the metadata and this metadata

1687
01:26:20,099 --> 01:26:27,179
could include the alternative object

1688
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:30,150
locations or supported object transport

1689
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:33,239
protocols or caching policies the

1690
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:36,268
security parameters the data format or

1691
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:40,348
hash of the object data etc and this

1692
01:26:36,269 --> 01:26:43,650
metadata could be used for selection of

1693
01:26:40,349 --> 01:26:46,280
the object Transfer Protocol or a

1694
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:53,460
security mechanism by egress in

1695
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:56,579
interfaces and so on and again the title

1696
01:26:53,460 --> 01:27:03,150
section Phi has been changed it to the

1697
01:26:56,579 --> 01:27:06,210
design guidelines and the second drop is

1698
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:12,659
on architecture consideration of the ICN

1699
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:18,119
using NRS and we added two new authors

1700
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:21,289
so we have all we are five now and the

1701
01:27:18,119 --> 01:27:25,530
scope of this document is the this

1702
01:27:21,289 --> 01:27:27,690
focuses on things relate to the ICN

1703
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:30,329
architecture so the difference between

1704
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:31,079
the first one is equal ease the first

1705
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:33,570
one was the

1706
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:36,900
we try to focus on the inner system

1707
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:39,119
itself but the second is these are

1708
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:42,030
things which is related I see and

1709
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:46,199
architecture so things you have to

1710
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:50,699
consider in respect of the ICN

1711
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:57,000
architecture here so this document also

1712
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:59,509
discussed how an ICA routing system has

1713
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:03,449
to be changed when analysis is

1714
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:06,449
integrated into ICF because another

1715
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:10,440
system is is not a mandatory to the ICN

1716
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:13,348
so you have you need you have a certain

1717
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:17,190
purpose to use the analysis in your in

1718
01:28:13,349 --> 01:28:22,170
your architecture so when you integrate

1719
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:24,719
your architecture then there are I said

1720
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:27,179
routing has to has to be changed so

1721
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,909
internal we discussed the in terms of

1722
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:33,150
the procedure and latency and security

1723
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:35,549
respect and then we provide the IC

1724
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:38,730
architecture considerations for NRS

1725
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:41,579
which Pruitt's includes the procedures

1726
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:44,129
of an RS system with name mapping

1727
01:28:41,579 --> 01:28:46,889
recalls and icing protocol design for

1728
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:54,360
another system and how to process the

1729
01:28:46,889 --> 01:28:57,000
result of the name resolution and this

1730
01:28:54,360 --> 01:29:04,790
is the major changes from previous one

1731
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:08,270
we added some terminologies and sexual

1732
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:11,750
5.1 we change it from the name

1733
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:15,170
resolution to the name mapping record

1734
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:19,050
registration resolution and update and

1735
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:24,360
this is about to hear the terminology

1736
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:27,900
actually originally in here the new

1737
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:31,880
Tamales is the name another server and

1738
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:35,269
analyst reserver as the generous

1739
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:38,460
components and the other two is namely

1740
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:43,409
registration and name resolution as the

1741
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:44,850
NRS process these for tamales was

1742
01:29:43,409 --> 01:29:47,389
defined origin

1743
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:54,720
in the previous version of the

1744
01:29:47,390 --> 01:30:01,080
requirement top man but before like we

1745
01:29:54,720 --> 01:30:05,100
had but these four is covered only by

1746
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:10,470
the explicit name resolution service

1747
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:14,270
approaches so we remove from the this

1748
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:17,880
party some knowledge from the first trap

1749
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:23,000
since the first draft covers the post

1750
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:30,150
approaches but this drop assumes

1751
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:33,900
explicitly the explicit name resolution

1752
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:35,969
service approaches so we thought it is

1753
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:39,750
Tom Lonny's is appropriate for this

1754
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:42,210
document so we moved from there to this

1755
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:47,280
document and then we change it the

1756
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:49,980
subsection 5.1 it was a short

1757
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:52,080
description about the who does the name

1758
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:53,910
resolution or how does the name their

1759
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:57,780
position or when does the limited

1760
01:30:53,910 --> 01:31:00,139
resolution the system and then we still

1761
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:03,120
we keep the contents of that

1762
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:05,310
participation but which is the way we

1763
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:08,720
describe has been changed into the we

1764
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:11,940
explain what is named is name

1765
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:14,060
registration and name resolution and

1766
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:16,799
what is the name we could update

1767
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:20,400
according to day we still they are

1768
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:22,620
explaining that who does the name

1769
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,080
resolution and when does the name

1770
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:27,240
dissolution so in this picture we

1771
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:32,100
haven't added this picture in the draft

1772
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:35,309
but just to just put it in this light

1773
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:39,150
that the name is the registration can be

1774
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:42,260
done by producer or I see a router also

1775
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:45,900
named the dilution can be done by

1776
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:50,030
consumer side or the I say router that's

1777
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:50,030
your choice when you design the system

1778
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:56,270
yeah this is all I have for today

1779
01:31:56,739 --> 01:32:07,410
I think isn't mature for our G last cold

1780
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:07,410
so any comments please

1781
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:20,320
so while Mark walks up to petrification

1782
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:23,680
so these are two in informational

1783
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:26,230
documents and so the idea is that we're

1784
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:29,170
not saying every IC pendant system needs

1785
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:31,989
name solution it's more like so if you

1786
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:34,660
are inclined to use them illusion these

1787
01:32:31,989 --> 01:32:37,269
are the considerations regarding the say

1788
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:42,040
in our system and the impact it would

1789
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:45,610
have on your ICN system okay yeah hi

1790
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:48,070
mark Moscow so so my understanding in

1791
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:51,790
the design considerations is the the

1792
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:56,860
name resolution can be done on a prefix

1793
01:32:51,790 --> 01:33:00,070
basis so I could register a prefix and

1794
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:03,219
have all names under that prefix you use

1795
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:06,750
that resolution we didn't assume any

1796
01:33:03,219 --> 01:33:11,890
type of the specific type of the name

1797
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:16,030
what we the way we described here is any

1798
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:19,630
type of the name you just register along

1799
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:23,130
with us some information so so depending

1800
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:27,460
on how you use it the information can be

1801
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:28,780
different things okay so yeah like a for

1802
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:31,840
for support

1803
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:35,590
mobility you can get the you could get a

1804
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:39,900
location or for like rowdy scalability

1805
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:49,270
you can use NRS then you can get the

1806
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:52,480
another name discovery meaning that I

1807
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:55,180
give you a name prefix and some

1808
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:59,259
parameters about the content I want to

1809
01:33:55,180 --> 01:34:01,180
search under that and there was a

1810
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:04,000
question well that sounds like a name

1811
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:06,040
resolutions yes yeah so do you envision

1812
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,510
something like that could be put into an

1813
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,510
NRS Oh

1814
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:15,550
yeah yeah I think in in the like a

1815
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:22,810
functionality section yeah we could

1816
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:24,910
include it yeah if you wanna keep it

1817
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:27,010
simpler or you want or you know you

1818
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:30,030
thought the helmet maybe this this sort

1819
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:32,440
of like search on names could be done

1820
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:35,610
because it's really a name to a name

1821
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:38,650
resolution not a team to a locator no no

1822
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:42,309
name to like information but that

1823
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:46,530
information could include all the types

1824
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:51,370
of like names or locator or whatever any

1825
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:54,700
including the any metadata yeah yes

1826
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:58,450
things so I'm gonna expose my lack of

1827
01:34:54,700 --> 01:35:01,030
knowledge here how does this relate to

1828
01:34:58,450 --> 01:35:03,580
the two different kinds of name services

1829
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:05,769
the mobility first provides one is the

1830
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:10,030
name certification service which also

1831
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:12,610
does kind of human friendly name to do

1832
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:15,460
UID and the other is the global

1833
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:18,070
resolution service which goes from G UID

1834
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:20,890
to something that helps you find things

1835
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:23,320
but so they've got they've partitioned

1836
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:26,200
the name resolution problem into two

1837
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,130
parts intentionally because they need

1838
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:29,230
they have different kinds of

1839
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:31,600
requirements so I'm wondering whether

1840
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:33,209
you've thought about that and how this

1841
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:36,640
relates to what they're talking about

1842
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:40,120
yeah we try to include all types of the

1843
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:46,330
name resolution and we we deal with the

1844
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:50,230
we didn't provide that we try to not to

1845
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:53,470
fry the too deep in each cases buffer

1846
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:55,719
like like what you are saying we I think

1847
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:59,410
we could include it as a mobility

1848
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:04,390
support functionality developed is like

1849
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:07,660
that yes so we covered it yeah but we

1850
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:12,810
didn't with in the draft we try to avoid

1851
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:16,300
the specific like mechanism or system or

1852
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:21,270
something like that we try to like more

1853
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:24,370
keep the general information about it so

1854
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:25,600
I wanted to make sure that

1855
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:27,040
it would be good to actually highlight

1856
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,330
these two different steps because in

1857
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,980
another system where it might be a bit

1858
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:32,559
unusual but this it actually includes

1859
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:35,889
the notion of main base routing is 3gpp

1860
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,480
5g 3gpp five-year has the option to do

1861
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:38,710
control plane routing based on name

1862
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,990
based routing mmm-hmm

1863
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:44,050
strangely enough but it actually has two

1864
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:46,030
steps it has to so called this service

1865
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:49,000
discovery profile resolution and the

1866
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:50,710
actual name based routing solution it's

1867
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,540
unfortunately all called name resolution

1868
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:54,520
function which is the thing that I

1869
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:56,350
disagree with me but it actually makes

1870
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,330
sure that differentiate these two

1871
01:36:56,350 --> 01:36:59,950
different steps so it says yes I want to

1872
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:02,680
do I don't know an authentication

1873
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:04,750
management function and it's Dave being

1874
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:06,790
in the u.s. under their subscriber ID

1875
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:08,620
please give me an actual real name I can

1876
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:10,390
route on and that's the very first step

1877
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:12,160
the second step is the one once I have

1878
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:14,380
that name how do I get to the instance

1879
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,880
action conservator and and it seems it

1880
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:17,740
might be quite useful because it's very

1881
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,450
similar to what the movie first it they

1882
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:21,519
actually make these two different steps

1883
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:23,679
quite clear in the actual draft that

1884
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,210
there are two different problems but it

1885
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,470
says in our system that we don't

1886
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:27,940
implement the first one because the

1887
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:30,790
first one is a lot about business logic

1888
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:33,940
how do you translate a subscriber onto a

1889
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:37,680
name you know form a routing perspective

1890
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:37,679
you might not care that much about it

1891
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:45,460
yeah I can comment on those two things

1892
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:48,099
is that the way these parts are written

1893
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:51,810
is that we're describing these at the

1894
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:54,370
high generic level so you have the

1895
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:57,340
explicit name resolution that you map

1896
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:59,500
something at the server like DNS or

1897
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:01,450
something like that and you have name is

1898
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:03,340
trapping and then we have the third

1899
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:06,160
thing which is a hybrid approach where

1900
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:09,190
you combine these in some way so I think

1901
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:13,090
all of these alternatives are covered at

1902
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:14,740
the high energy level in the draft and I

1903
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:17,230
believe we have examples for mobility

1904
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:19,960
first in the draft as well so you should

1905
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:22,780
mention some of these other cases in the

1906
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,950
director that they are but I think one

1907
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:28,090
of the things that's interesting about

1908
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:31,780
mobility first model is that they named

1909
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:33,280
the high level resolution service they

1910
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,670
recognized that there may be many of

1911
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,679
them

1912
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:37,300
I could choose one that's fast I could

1913
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,989
choose one that's specialized I could

1914
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:40,120
choose one that

1915
01:38:37,989 --> 01:38:42,309
certain characteristics so there are

1916
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:45,309
multiple different possibilities for

1917
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:47,440
that name resolution surface but the

1918
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:49,390
understanding is once you've gone to the

1919
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:52,419
once you've mapped to that name which

1920
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:55,090
needs to be globally resolvable there

1921
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:56,830
you need one so there are different

1922
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:59,830
requirements and different kind of

1923
01:38:56,830 --> 01:39:01,420
constraints on those systems which is

1924
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:03,969
part of the reason you want to separate

1925
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:05,830
them because in some cases you you you

1926
01:39:03,969 --> 01:39:09,360
allow for many different possibilities

1927
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:13,780
and the other you must have exactly one

1928
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:15,670
so thinking about that yeah for the

1929
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:17,290
world you're saying and being very

1930
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:19,239
careful to talk about the name

1931
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:21,760
resolution service and not the name

1932
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:23,679
resolution system or multiples so we

1933
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,239
what we talked about this that you can

1934
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,330
have a service that didn't name or

1935
01:39:25,239 --> 01:39:29,860
solution and that can be implemented as

1936
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:32,219
different systems and you can have

1937
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:34,870
things that scale between different

1938
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:41,530
applications in R so I should go mean it

1939
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:46,690
it's really the answer okay okay great

1940
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:48,670
so I mean this book has has have been

1941
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:52,360
discussed and you did a couple of times

1942
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:55,469
here in the group so what and we think

1943
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:59,320
it has reached a good level of maturity

1944
01:39:55,469 --> 01:40:02,170
so what we would like to do is issue

1945
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:06,549
that which I should last call on the

1946
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:08,710
list now and of course if there are more

1947
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:11,469
comments like this we will deal with

1948
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:14,430
them but we think that that's a good

1949
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:18,610
next step now for us to just have people

1950
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:22,780
read it again and yeah come up with

1951
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:25,089
their substantial comments so that's

1952
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:30,480
gonna happen after this meeting okay

1953
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:30,480
thank you very much thank you all right

1954
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:44,080
so that was the end of our technical

1955
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:46,730
agenda just a few pieces of information

1956
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:50,300
so I mentioned the ICN conference

1957
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:53,959
there's actually another ICN event even

1958
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:58,639
before that there is the NBN community

1959
01:40:53,960 --> 01:41:05,090
meeting September fifth and six in

1960
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:07,639
Gaithersburg Maryland so at the Hong

1961
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:09,830
Kong ACM conference so that's going to

1962
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:12,940
be the main conference that I before

1963
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:16,760
there's the touch and the end event and

1964
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:18,348
we would also like to have an interim

1965
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:21,949
meeting after the conference so on

1966
01:41:18,349 --> 01:41:23,210
Friday the 27th so that means if you

1967
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:28,580

1968
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:31,270

1970
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:39,500
no big so we have always been I've been

1971
01:41:37,219 --> 01:41:41,560
doing this for the last year's at the

1972
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:45,110
conference because it was actually

1973
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,060
always a really nice opportunity to for

1974
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:48,769
example do a deep dive on certain

1975
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:51,199
interesting topics that came up at the

1976
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:54,920
conference give people a chance to

1977
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:58,309
really say discuss things with more

1978
01:41:54,920 --> 01:42:01,300
depth so that we prefer a tour papers

1979
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:03,739
actually quite useful and in past years

1980
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:06,650

1981
