2
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
okay welcome to Bess let's just make you

3
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:12,640
starts because we don't want to keep you

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:14,680
make you late for dinner after us okay

5
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,829
we have we have two blue sheets going

6
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,420
around four three three blocks of seats

7
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,500
but this one it's on the blue sheets and

8
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,640
when you're the last one at the back of

9
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,110
the room it could be really helpful if

10
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:37,238
you could bring this front at the end of

11
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:41,400
the session so here is a note one shoe a

12
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,400
little watch it please please read it

13
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,690
Lucian's

14
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:59,190
okay so here is our agenda so let's

15
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,190
start the speaker every geunyang

16
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,639
[Music]

17
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,959
and thank you I'm gone from hallway and

18
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:26,750
I'll give an introduction for thematic

19
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:29,579
osteon models actually II saw hands

20
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,970
presented Marquez to weaken your models

21
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,190
in past are you care from meetings so

22
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,709
today I majorly focused on the major

23
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:43,140
changes since them ok here is the

24
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,319
structure of the Americas to VPN

25
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,958
Llamados there is no changing on a

26
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,890
structure I just give an introduction

27
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,310
for a better understanding first of the

28
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:59,510
matter cos of VPN models is at the same

29
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:05,639
level as unique as layer 3 VPN models

30
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:07,349
mother's second nearer to levels in mark

31
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,380
with Americas to Llamados

32
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,810
the first level is the VBA instances of

33
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,019
level the second level is the key a nice

34
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,940
here my eye level here we have an

35
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:24,270
inclusive PMSI selective OPM I sign

36
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,760
third both ipv6 and ipv4 they have the

37
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:32,969
same structure of Marrakesh weakened

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:36,150
models and here I introduce the major

39
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,289
changes the first updater is we

40
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:44,210
introduced new type P tunnel which is

41
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:49,699
defined according to RFC

42
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:54,320
6513 so this is the provider tunnels so

43
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:55,680
in this new type of pianos we have

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,919
rsvp-te

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,930
p2 MP from Audi ppm he and premisis MP p

46
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,250
Maya and better prima those kind of

47
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,950
things defined this new piano is

48
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,520
literally make it easier for the family

49
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:19,770
cost we clean your mother's so this is a

50
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:25,710
Ptah no and a second the update we re

51
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:29,190
the beer as a pita no options so here in

52
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,919
beer we defined under the PMI psy is

53
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:37,500
both under-inclusive emsi and a

54
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:42,539
selective PMSI and this is a operational

55
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:46,130
state of the beer as pita knows the

56
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:48,870
third ups today is we introduced

57
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:54,180
explicitly the tracking mode in a movie

58
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:58,199
can Llamados it's defined under

59
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,479
selective PMSI also we have introduced

60
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,389
upstream of VPN labels this is the for

61
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,340
the scenarios for multiple VPNs sharing

62
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:10,740
the same pita knows provider Thanos and

63
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,979
those are the major changes since day

64
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,770
and we'd like to have more comments from

65
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:28,710
you and prepare for a young doctor

66
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:30,479
review i'm rishabh from cisco I just

67
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,460
took a quick look at the model is

68
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,130
actually many errors which you might not

69
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,698
see on the data tracker page but if you

70
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,289
go to yang Bali later yang catalog yang

71
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,360
I think some of these models you're

72
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,710
using have changed and your arguments

73
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,240
are incorrect and all that so it would

74
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,039
be good to it's not first okay I can

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,870
show you the errors come seeing a few or

76
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,870
if you're interested okay I'll go

77
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,800
any more comments yeah one comment

78
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,449
Stephanie Costa speaking as individual I

79
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:13,020
think as part of this model we need also

80
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:19,229
to think about the extension to vase

81
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:23,219
pgpr model so I have started to contact

82
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:27,449
via a few guys who are editing via VPN

83
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,810
weather to try to agree on our words and

84
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:34,050
all the responsibility ana and what

85
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:39,650
should we do as part of the best of the

86
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:44,910
best work so globally the conclusion

87
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:49,460
seems to be that we as part of best

88
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:57,150
should be responsible to add a kind of

89
00:07:49,460 --> 00:08:00,630
BGP modules that should amend the BGP

90
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,440
yang model to provide the officially an

91
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:08,789
Associated container but also the

92
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,520
extension to the routing table so to be

93
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:15,539
able to get for example dbgap local read

94
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,719
for M VPN or piano l2 if you know

95
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:21,210
whatever address family that we are

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,650
creating at that are not fully supported

97
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,650
in the base BGP model

98
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,419
thank you

99
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:49,600
[Music]

100
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:51,430
next speaker before I - good evening my

101
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,170
name is reka Liberata from Cisco

102
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,290
I'll be presenting updates to the other

103
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:02,079
weekend and EVP and yang models since

104
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:04,750
the last ITF so we had several meetings

105
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,180
since Prague offline but we followed up

106
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,510
with another one during this IETF week

107
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:13,599
with all these stakeholders to to close

108
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,580
on many of the open issues that we were

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,870
still having including some of the

110
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,600
issues that were raised already on the

111
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,600
mailing list this was on last Tuesday

112
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,820
three of the major conclusions from from

113
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,860
this this meeting is that first of all

114
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,780
the models proposed use MPLS

115
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,550
encapsulation as the as the de facto and

116
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,260
what that means is there are references

117
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,109
to for example the explan encapsulation

118
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,230
in these yang models and following that

119
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,920
discussion the the base concept here

120
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,840
would be that these drafts propose

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,030
essentially a foundation for the end

122
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,220
caps other than MPLS but do not define

123
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:57,939
them so there is some cleanup to be done

124
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,370
there the second conclusion is that the

125
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,190
focus is now basically on consensus on

126
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,700
these models not 100% completeness with

127
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,410
everything evpn that is out there so we

128
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,270
do have alignment across the auto VP I

129
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:14,949
know through VPN and EVP end models and

130
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,810
some of the main pending actions we have

131
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,020
other than that the nits and corrections

132
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:23,349
are to add an appendix in the EDP on

133
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,920
model with examples for EVP n RB v pw s

134
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,690
and to make some of the choice names we

135
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,780
have in the models less-restrictive for

136
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:37,900
future extension so the o2 VPN model is

137
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:41,170
pretty much completed as part of the

138
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:44,079
conversation on Tuesday the authors felt

139
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,130
that it was it was necessary to add IRB

140
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,940
interfaces for completeness to the LTP

141
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,560
model and that one of the major

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,350
conclusions we had was that essentially

143
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,790
the the evpn instance in evpn model

144
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:01,360
would augment the l2 VPN model and there

145
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,650
was a discussion at some point around

146
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,700
once we settled on this augmentation

147
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,840
about to depend by sorry augmentation

148
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,450
about to be penned by the you can

149
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,300
instance then the conversation turned to

150
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:20,180
having potentially more than one

151
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:24,560
independence tense in an l2 VPN for the

152
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,689
evpn model it's less it's it's less

153
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,270
complete so it has still several minor

154
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,340
updates to be made so we do have a list

155
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,370
of those the more the more striking

156
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:38,150
examples are for example moving the

157
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,770
ingress replication to be attached for

158
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,270
if you can instance rather than the way

159
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,939
it's currently defined which is global

160
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:47,360
per evpn are so global in the model

161
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,580
sorry and as I mentioned previously some

162
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,650
of the things like AC or pseudo are

163
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:57,350
choices should be made more generic to

164
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:59,329
be extensible in the future one idea

165
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,430
that came up would be to create a base

166
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,680
identity for load balancing so currently

167
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,140
load balancing is defined for all active

168
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,770
and single active but there are other

169
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,170
modes being defined already and that I

170
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,060
think I presented in Prague so the idea

171
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,150
would be having a base identity that can

172
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,489
be extended and there was a conversation

173
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:24,160
around a splitter rising group for for

174
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:26,360
Evi so it'll be completed for that so

175
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,890
like I mentioned one of the major

176
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,350
updates is actually including an

177
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,170
appendix with with examples of how to

178
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:36,560
use this model so typically or namely

179
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:39,920
for EVP and bridging for ETN IRB and if

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,459
you can V PWS use cases so we will

181
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:52,310
require one more revision of the evpn

182
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:57,410
yang model so same point as I mentioned

183
00:12:52,310 --> 00:13:00,979
for MVP n varies requirement to create

184
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:04,310
Enda GPL to VPN model as part of the

185
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:08,959
same draft but supplied module that

186
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:11,508
should augment base yeah so I spoke to

187
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,628
to the authors of the the BGP based

188
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:17,660
model and we are aligned in terms of our

189
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:22,009
references to RFC 82 94 if I'm not

190
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:23,269
mistaken but they define a node that you

191
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,310
have to be penalty between models show

192
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:29,180
that should attach to and extend so we

193
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:32,000
will be doing that this is a mantra from

194
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,859
Siena I don't know whether you just

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,310
touched up on the topic I was going to

196
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:42,430
make a comment on but I know that Stefan

197
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:44,899
and Jeff are discussing the BGP RDR t

198
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,170
inclusions and I haven't followed up the

199
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:50,860
thread but I won't know whether that

200
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:54,290
means we have to do some more work or

201
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,600
what's the deal there with respect to

202
00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:03,500
the RDR T types and which would be

203
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:06,649
related stuff the policies and Jeff has

204
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,649
so the a speech P model right now is

205
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:12,380
where some identity is like a feast a

206
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,850
few live right now you know we're in the

207
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,680
process of figuring out you know what

208
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,319
module ends up owning those and where

209
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,729
they get extended from you know there

210
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:22,699
are two options open for each of those

211
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,130
one of those is to have it I am a

212
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:27,800
managed it just gets extended there that

213
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,029
makes it fast to revise but since this

214
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,920
is one of the things that in the end

215
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,639
that you can revise the individual

216
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,370
module that's also a possibility as well

217
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,110
the inclination that I'm pushing right

218
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,019
now when please keep in mind that I've

219
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:45,439
just started helping out with this this

220
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:49,370
is a long-standing work is that things

221
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:52,250
that are extensions to BGP that are tied

222
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:54,589
to one of the VPN servers battles no

223
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,870
should actually go in no by augmentation

224
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:58,850
when possible if we if you can do that

225
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,860
it means that the design that the ensign

226
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,079
of the base peach-pit module is doing

227
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,930
its job and you're going to probably end

228
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:10,969
up with separate sub modules such that

229
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:13,069
you can add the BGP pieces in your model

230
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,930
and therefore bgp can operationally

231
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,959
handle the protocol components so you

232
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,859
can do a show BGP and see here's this Fe

233
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:23,839
Safi no 4 do Pedras family and through

234
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,600
the counters court as an example and you

235
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,519
can have policy extensions to the idea

236
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,670
policy module the truth interact with

237
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,319
these things at a PGP level but it's

238
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,389
potentially possible that the service

239
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:37,040
model may not yet be implemented so by

240
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,100
having these things as structurally

241
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,899
separate it means that BGP can be used

242
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,699
policy can be used and service models

243
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:52,639
can be used somewhat independently of

244
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:54,920
each other in terms of implementation my

245
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:00,410
only question is what do I need to do on

246
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:06,889
the l2 via can you take it to the

247
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:11,360
mailing list ok AC Linda I heard Jeff

248
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:16,540
mentioned the address families and they

249
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:21,319
are all defined in 82 94 I'm not sure

250
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,930
about the BGP all the Saffy's but at

251
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:29,540
least the adverse memories are all there

252
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:35,479
what okay in any case we are always

253
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:37,099
creating new ethnicities yeah they come

254
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,809
and they just make their KC that people

255
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,019
couldn't hear is that these are a couple

256
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:44,209
there's EFI's Hafiz a fee as a BGP thing

257
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:50,329
that is somewhat separate wasn't a yeah

258
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:53,540
I know module on the encapsulation

259
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:55,279
specific parts of the model I think

260
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,540
probably we need some discussion between

261
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,059
the chairs of different working groups

262
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,230
own encapsulations

263
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:04,369
applicable to a VPN an l2 VPN so that so

264
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,520
they have kind of a modular approach

265
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:10,129
where maybe the working group that owns

266
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,280
or is largely developing data

267
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,900
encapsulation technology takes the does

268
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,730
the model for the encapsulation so we

269
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,459
don't end up risk ending up with

270
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,679
multiple models the same encapsulation

271
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,720
or application specific models for the

272
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,500
encapsulation so for example with the X

273
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,720
line and

274
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,269
in picture tonight I'll kidnap for

275
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,429
European and Ezreal exactly so the

276
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:33,559
proposal helps to define the foundation

277
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,629
so that the NGO model could then

278
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,759
essentially extend so we would support

279
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:40,009
as a foundation any any encapsulation

280
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,690
requirements from an vo being date the

281
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:47,240
use case we had in making some pho we've

282
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,679
had some constant Baris yang models for

283
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,220
the X line we go along for the journey

284
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:58,129
and so on and so we had an AI to follow

285
00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:00,769
up in n vo tomorrow they see again yeah

286
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:02,330
the it it couldn't be a couple but it

287
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:04,580
should I think it should reference

288
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:08,689
eighty to ninety four I don't I don't

289
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,389
see why at least take a look at it and

290
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,659
this isn't I Anna maintain model we

291
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:19,758
split up the types that were relatively

292
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:24,590
static with the enums for the address

293
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:28,220
friendlies in and sat BGP Saffy's just

294
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:31,610
to in order in order to allow the latter

295
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,580
model to be maintained by and I Anna and

296
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,490
periodically generated so so both for

297
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,470
the RDR T's and the fsfe we do down RIF

298
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,210
eighty to ninety four the question is

299
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,100
then just for that for the node attach

300
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,110
point we might we may just reference the

301
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,610
BGP model but that's also going to be

302
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:54,428
using the eighty to ninety four types

303
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:54,428
type depths thank you

304
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:19,550
hello my name is Jorge Robin and this is

305
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,139
a list of my co-authors for this draft

306
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,930
so this is what I want to talk about

307
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,290
first of all a short refresh about with

308
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:31,440
the trophies and second point is what's

309
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:36,960
new in revision one in the third point

310
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:39,960
is next steps so the idea behind this

311
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,930
draft is to provide a solution for

312
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,170
multicast redundancy and that solution

313
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:49,850
should actually work in any evpn network

314
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:54,120
and what that means is that you may have

315
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:56,070
sources that are multihomed you know

316
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,679
redundant sources that are single home

317
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:02,970
or redundant sources that are multihomed

318
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:06,260
to the network and and this should work

319
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,820
in any evpn tennen domain configuration

320
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,640
which means that the sources and

321
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,550
receivers they can have it can be

322
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,560
attached to the same broadcast domain

323
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:21,750
different broadcast domains or a mix

324
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:26,040
right so cheriya here is to avoid the

325
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:29,880
duplication so when you have redundant

326
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:33,180
sources and what that means is if you

327
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,550
don't do anything special let's say that

328
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,820
in the diagram here in the example you

329
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:41,930
have two sources are actually sending

330
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,760
the same flow the same multicast flow

331
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,400
from a multicast perspective because

332
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,040
they're coming from different sources

333
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,200
they are treated as different flows and

334
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,560
what that means is that basically the

335
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,230
receivers will get to placate traffic so

336
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,720
they will have to deal with it well we

337
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,810
want with this draft is to provide a

338
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,210
solution so that a network avoids this

339
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:09,030
duplication and provides a redundant

340
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,610
solution so one important concept that

341
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,129
we are

342
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:18,830
handling here is what we call the single

343
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:22,519
flow group or s FG so NS FG is basically

344
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,620
a multicast group that represents you

345
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,649
know single flow that can be sourced

346
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,539
from different IP addresses from these

347
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:31,820
different sources right

348
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:35,000
but those sources they basically send

349
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,760
the same content and that's what the you

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,640
know the application that we want to

351
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,669
avoid so there are two solutions in the

352
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,240
draft so the first one is what we call

353
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:49,279
the warm standby solution or ws and the

354
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:54,159
second solution is what we call the hot

355
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:57,470
standby solution so the first one and

356
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,710
apologies for the this slide is not in

357
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,860
PowerPoint actually it looks nicer but

358
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,700
basically the first one the it's about

359
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:12,678
the upstream T's the ones connected to

360
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:15,340
the SFG sources the ones selecting only

361
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:19,370
one of the piece as single for water and

362
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:22,549
and the other one not sending the DSF G

363
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:26,000
right the second solution is basically

364
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:28,549
set down cmp based solution the idea is

365
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,860
that the upstream keys are connected to

366
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:33,139
the redundant sources they both will

367
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,019
send the traffic and the downstream

368
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:38,658
piece that are attached to the receivers

369
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,840
they'll they'll pick up one of the two

370
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:44,600
right and they will avoid the

371
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,820
duplication and obviously there are

372
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,370
procedures in case of a failure of one

373
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,120
source the other one will have to take

374
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,830
over and you know with a fast failover

375
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,760
so which one is better now why we are

376
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,260
including both solutions in the draft so

377
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,370
well it depends on what your

378
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,929
requirements are if your requirement is

379
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,830
to optimize the the bandwidth

380
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:12,409
consumption you should go to the WS

381
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,769
solution if your requirement is to

382
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:17,899
upgrade the the least amount of piece in

383
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:21,320
the network you should go to the AWS

384
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:23,570
solution but if your requirement is to

385
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,379
have you know the fastest failover

386
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,330
possible

387
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,679
you should go to the hot standby

388
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:33,918
solution so what he will change in

389
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,990
revision zero one so basically based on

390
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,070
the feedback from the working group

391
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:43,789
actually in particular from manga mana

392
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:45,950
we changed the definition of the SFG so

393
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,370
individual zero zero was represented as

394
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:53,059
star Komachi which pretty much means

395
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:56,469
that any source transmitting that group

396
00:23:53,059 --> 00:24:00,620
was considered to be a redundant

397
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:03,200
redundant source for the sfg now we have

398
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,629
finer granularity in the sense that we

399
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,049
are we are defining an Eskimo G where

400
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:13,100
the S is actually a prefix it's not a

401
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:15,289
host and so the any two sources or more

402
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,530
sources that are contained with an

403
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:21,440
within that subnet the Hansa lengths are

404
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:25,309
considered redundant sources for the s

405
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,039
FG and you have to bear in mind that we

406
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,950
are allowing here prefixes to be sent

407
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:33,860
with the SP MCAD routes only for the

408
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,400
particular application of the redundant

409
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,809
redundant sources only that the other

410
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:44,000
improvement that we are adding to the

411
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:45,950
draft is in in version 0 0 we add a nes

412
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,520
i attribute that we needed to send along

413
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:52,190
with the SMC routes but it was it was

414
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,120
kind of open we didn't say what kind of

415
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:59,000
attribute it was so here basically among

416
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,399
the authors we agreed the best solution

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,919
was to add any si label extended

418
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:07,340
community which is already defined in

419
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,830
RFC 743 to the only thing is that we are

420
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,500
advertising that community along with

421
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,889
the SP MC rounds and then this is used

422
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,289
for the hot standby solution and besides

423
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,220
that we added some you know we fixed

424
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:25,039
some typos and added some clarifications

425
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:29,090
so with those improvements this is how

426
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,890
the warm step by solution works you have

427
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,280
here an example with two redundant

428
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:36,830
sources for one s FG and that receivers

429
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,330
are attached to the downstream T's and

430
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,779
again this can be

431
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,570
any type of PvP antenna network so you

432
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:46,390
know all the hosts can be attached to

433
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,039
the same broadcast domain or different

434
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:53,510
with you know single broadcast domain or

435
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:56,059
or based on on in Oia SM Network so here

436
00:25:53,510 --> 00:26:00,230
P 1 and P 2 would be configured to know

437
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:03,320
that you know G 1 is an SSG and we could

438
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:07,130
be using the representation of in star

439
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,730
Komachi or a subnet Komachi for the 4 d

440
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:13,700
s FG let's assume here that s 1 and s 2

441
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:17,539
they fall into this subnet that we are

442
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,460
configuring for the s FG and so once we

443
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:23,960
do that and we start receiving traffic

444
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:29,889
for the s FG we will advertise the SPM

445
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:33,019
z80 routes evpn s been c80 routes and

446
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:35,389
those will be advertised with a DF

447
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:39,409
election extended community defined in

448
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:41,539
RFC 85-84 and with that extended

449
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:44,120
community basically the the to upstream

450
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:47,059
piece they will be able to select what

451
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,449
we call a single forwarder and the

452
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:53,690
single for weather will be the only one

453
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:57,590
sending the SF g and the other one in

454
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:00,500
this case p2 will program an RPF check

455
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,990
rule to basically discard the traffic as

456
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,230
long as the single forward is is a

457
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,269
different P so this is if the first

458
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,980
solution the second solution is a hot

459
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,720
standby solution and here you have an

460
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,399
example about how it works in this

461
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,820
particular example you have two

462
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:21,168
redundant sources for the s FG that are

463
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,908
multihomed both of them so in in this

464
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,220
configuration basically you need to

465
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,029
upgrade all the t's whereas in the

466
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,649
previous one

467
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:31,429
you only had to upgrade their the

468
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:33,260
upstream please so here p1 and p2 will

469
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:37,220
be configured to know that and start

470
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,779
Komachi for instances and s FG you have

471
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,950
the two ethernet segments that are

472
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:44,149
configured to us as usual in evpn and

473
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,789
you will also need to configure the

474
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:49,729
downstream piece as a hot standby mode

475
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:51,260
and as soon as you make the

476
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,130
configuration on the upstream piece

477
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,190
there

478
00:27:52,130 --> 00:28:00,200
be signaling of the SMC routes for the

479
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:02,510
entire sfg and we will attach the ESI

480
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,890
level extended communities for their to

481
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:09,320
Ethernet segments that we have here it's

482
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,050
important to highlight that the the ESI

483
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,889
labels that we are using here they are

484
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:20,690
DC be allocated ESI level so domain wide

485
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:24,380
common block and we do that because

486
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:27,110
basically we need to make sure that you

487
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:31,130
know p1 and p2 they use the same label

488
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:34,129
for years years one and they use a

489
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,220
different but the same label for years

490
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,440
too because in that way we can we make

491
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,290
sure that they downstream piece they can

492
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:47,810
identify the flow coming from either

493
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:49,970
source without any ambiguity so after

494
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:53,050
that they use a labels are also

495
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:56,090
advertised in a deeper years routes and

496
00:28:53,050 --> 00:29:00,620
and with all that information downstream

497
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:03,620
piece are able to make some RTF check

498
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:07,520
programming the idea is that and they

499
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,159
will be receiving you know the same s FG

500
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,770
from two different sources and therefore

501
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,110
from two different with two different

502
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:19,820
ASI labels and they should be able to

503
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:21,709
discard one of them and of course there

504
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,040
are procedures about what to do in case

505
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:28,040
of a failure on a you know on a link on

506
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,940
the the whole source etc and we are

507
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,470
saying that in addition to to do the

508
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:40,910
failure detection based on the withdraw

509
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:42,050
of the ad routes we also allow PFT so

510
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,020
basically that's pretty much of what

511
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,820
we've done with the draft and so first

512
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,650
of all we would like to thank the the

513
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,310
working group for they received feedback

514
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:54,650
and secondly we would like to ask for

515
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,740
money for working group adoption we

516
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:03,340
believe it is mature enough for being

517
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,340
adopted at this point questions

518
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,770
the

519
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:10,980
that you mentioned that so there is a be

520
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:16,530
of the being to detect the failure so

521
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:21,059
can you just briefly mention what beef T

522
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:25,139
is doing and how it's used so um so we

523
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:27,510
know there's a PFT draft for evpn so

524
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,510
actually one of the things we wanted to

525
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,460
do this to collaborate with the authors

526
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,220
of that draft and see if we can use it

527
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,530
here so at the moment if you look at

528
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,770
this the PFD section in this traffic is

529
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,450
just mentioning that you can use PFT

530
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:47,220
learn there are no details

531
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:53,929
okay so yeah we'll meet to to discuss

532
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:56,580
and collaborate any other questions I

533
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:58,200
just have a look on play Cisco I should

534
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,699
have a quick question if you go back to

535
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,260
the warm versus hot standby the the

536
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,420
differentiation between the two is that

537
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,580
detected based on the presence or non

538
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,040
presence of ESI label is it a local

539
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,360
config no here there is no way

540
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,330
assignable whatsoever

541
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,050
so only in hot standby only I could sign

542
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,178
by yes

543
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,980
so if I receive an ESI label I would

544
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,610
just basically assume hot standby

545
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:27,240
otherwise it may be both know this so

546
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:29,939
basically you should use either or in a

547
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,670
single turn on domain right and this is

548
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,490
so this mode basically says it's purely

549
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:37,170
controlling if you will so the upstream

550
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,880
piece where you've configured that you

551
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,570
may have written on sources they will

552
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,830
select this single folder and that's it

553
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,169
but there is no there is no need to

554
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,169
differentiate in the data path both

555
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,630
flows because there will be only a one

556
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,730
flow coming from one source that's the

557
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,590
idea and if you go to the hot standby

558
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,770
slide I just have a clarifying question

559
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:03,419
so you say p1 p2 advertise the a deeper

560
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:06,570
es route with an ESI label from d CB is

561
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,750
that replacing or on top of the regular

562
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,620
es e 0 so that the second line in yours

563
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,620
in bullet 2

564
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:19,050
no this is so of course these are

565
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:22,920
regular different segments which means

566
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:25,680
that you need to advertise ad various

567
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,890
routes with The Associated labels right

568
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:33,060
but you need a way to correlate a given

569
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:36,150
an s FG to a given it on a segment so

570
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:39,409
the way you do it is basically on one

571
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:41,820
hand you advertise the regular ad routes

572
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,850
but on the other hand you advertise the

573
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,810
tsfc location with SB MC routes and you

574
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:50,909
attach the same ESI label extended

575
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:53,610
community that you are using for that

576
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:57,270
particular psi and you can have multiple

577
00:32:53,610 --> 00:33:02,250
sites in that direction not the other

578
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:03,780
way around the label so it's just the

579
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,130
way it's worded I guess I'm just

580
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,560
confused I haven't read the draft but

581
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,170
just the way it's worded here it seems

582
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,870
that the the SMC decides on the label

583
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:16,020
and that will then replace the one in

584
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,219
the ESC deer oh no so well basically the

585
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,460
si labels are

586
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,470
DCPI low allocated which means that they

587
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,080
are not really

588
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:28,040
they are either configured or they are

589
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:32,129
allocated by a controller but either way

590
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:34,920
so the ESI label one that you send with

591
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,050
the SP MC route in this example will be

592
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,800
the same label that you advertise from

593
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:47,000
p1 or if I'm not segment one in the

594
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:50,450
1830's front ok ok any other question

595
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,450
right thank you

596
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,549
next speaker

597
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:21,219
hi I'm Donald Eastlake with future way

598
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,899
he's a pretty brief graphed on the brief

599
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:30,129
presentation on the progress of this

600
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:34,899
draft so it's draft on the network layer

601
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:37,600
OAM and where that fits is described in

602
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:39,790
this other D draft on the OEM

603
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,230
requirements and framework I just want

604
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,050
to show a couple slides from that to

605
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,810
show how this fits in this is the

606
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:49,600
typical flow from CD to PE through the

607
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:52,239
peas to PE to see in that different

608
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,830
levels of OEM are shown at the bottom of

609
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,080
this draft so the ones that are handled

610
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,660
by other mechanisms are it's pretty

611
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,890
straightforward link OEM depends on the

612
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:09,490
link technology the transport OAM

613
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:11,080
between the various P nodes depends on

614
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,359
what transport you're using this

615
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,100
different methods there and the service

616
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,310
of course being provided is Ethernet

617
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,279
service so typically you'd use Ethernet

618
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:24,790
OAM end-to-end so what's left is the the

619
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,300
network o am from p2p just what this

620
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:32,410
draft is concerning and the use of

621
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,290
describes the use of BFD for that so it

622
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:39,730
uses VF e asynchronous mode right proact

623
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:44,440
default detection basically ferry VPN

624
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:48,250
based on things in the pattern of RFC

625
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:52,090
7432 it covers in the current version

626
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:55,840
MPLS and VX lan encapsulation - taps

627
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,869
lations unicast traffic broadcasts

628
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,450
unknown unicast and multicast traffic

629
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:05,200
using multi point to point and point to

630
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:09,160
multi-point so the BFD discriminators

631
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:13,210
are obtained for the VFD here via bgp

632
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,730
this graph references the MVP n fast

633
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:20,890
failover graft which provides means of

634
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:23,020
distributing PFD discriminators the

635
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,240
changes from the last graph that was

636
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:28,060
presented are to add that mechanism for

637
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,770
distribution to add VX encapsulation

638
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,940
which wasn't previously covered and

639
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,790
there's a bunch of miscellaneous

640
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:39,640
improvements including considerably more

641
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:42,460
diagrams of practice headers PFD

642
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,368
discriminators use the BGP BFD attribute

643
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,910
and that's pretty simple as shown what

644
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:50,680
their value that attribute is here as

645
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,730
the discriminator and some flags come

646
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,379
none of which are actually defined

647
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:57,910
currently but they're available there's

648
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:59,590
some future need so the bulk of this

649
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:03,490
draft is devoted to specifying the

650
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:06,490
encapsulations for MPLS and of vvx lan

651
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,930
as a type of there for these different

652
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,939
types of traffic and there's both

653
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:12,279
textual descriptions and also

654
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,890
diagrammatic descriptions of these

655
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,530
encapsulations so to show the level of

656
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,210
detail I have a couple ones which you

657
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,400
probably can't read but I don't know

658
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,690
maybe if you should download the slides

659
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,300
and look on your screen you can probably

660
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,480
read them this is a MPLS unicast

661
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,109
encapsulation and the X LAN

662
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:36,100
unicast encapsulation there's also

663
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:38,109
diagrams for other stuff in there so I'm

664
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,470
not claiming all this as flawless I'd be

665
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:43,890
happy to have people look at this and

666
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:46,180
they find problem as well we'll fix them

667
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:52,000
there are things that could be added to

668
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:54,160
this draft the covering pvb e VPN or

669
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,680
covering the IRB

670
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,330
invaded routing and bridging or you can

671
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,649
even add additional encapsulations so

672
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,619
that's those are possible things that

673
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:09,400
could be added but we think this draft

674
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:11,710
is pretty good for the areas it covers

675
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,930
currently and it would be a reasonable

676
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,880
graph to be adopted by the working group

677
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,000
working group can decide whether it's

678
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,850
essential or not to add these other

679
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,609
things to the draft over coverage which

680
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:28,720
could be done after adoption perhaps

681
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:31,960
yep porque no then Nokia

682
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,330
yes lady dress looks much better than in

683
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,910
the previous

684
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:39,069
version thank you so I yeah I think I

685
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,839
support it for working up adoption

686
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:45,720
do you the thing that I'm missing is the

687
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:50,550
how are you going to use this

688
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:53,919
destructive EFT is the intention to

689
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:57,010
advertise a discriminator or Mac verse

690
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,099
or interface you can even advertise one

691
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,650
per MAC address if you want it missing

692
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:05,830
kind of the use cases and I said earlier

693
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,390
in my presentation we need to work

694
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,848
together because one of the use cases

695
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:13,240
for me is the the multicast source

696
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:15,849
redundancy and for that I guess you

697
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,709
would need to add also the the EVP and

698
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:21,640
sbeam sea route to distribute the

699
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:24,240
discriminators yeah we'll be happy to

700
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,230
work with you I think the where's the

701
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,640
attribute with the discriminator can be

702
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,680
included with various types of routes

703
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,810
but there was additional information

704
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,680
that's probably needed to indicate this

705
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:37,750
how it's to be used the other thing I

706
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,779
was wondering as I saw in that section

707
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,880
where you are saying how you are

708
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:47,380
distribute the discriminator south with

709
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,839
BGP you took up about the Mac I IP

710
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:54,070
routes for unicast you talked about

711
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:58,660
English multicast route for MMP 20-ton

712
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:01,210
oats and the p20 is TBD so yeah I would

713
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:06,910
assume it's a inclusive multicast route

714
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:09,730
or it's been around but yes well okay I

715
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:12,879
mean I was surprised to see TBD well

716
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:15,520
yeah you know I said there are it this

717
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,810
graft is not you know ready to go to RFC

718
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,450
or anything does need a little more work

719
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,160
so okay let's discuss what it was yeah

720
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,819
any kind of comments would be welcome on

721
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,259
the draft

722
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:28,420
all right sure thank you Bhushan raman

723
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,910
Cisco question I just read the draft

724
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:35,500
before the meeting I see busy dedicated

725
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:37,450
mark question for Greg to the VX the VFD

726
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,400
VX and draft there's been lots of

727
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:42,460
changes recently and lots of questions

728
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,650
regarding the need of a dedicated Mac so

729
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,740
that's something which might have to go

730
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:50,860
okay and the other question

731
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:53,709
mine pls forwarding is a bit stale

732
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:57,400
there's an ACH in there but there's no

733
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:03,420
gals of that part also wasn't dear to me

734
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:07,390
yes will reflect discussion what will be

735
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:11,160
resulting document on the d4 vietze then

736
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,160
will be reflected in this document

737
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,169
I don't remember my table yet I need to

738
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,109
look at it but yes you're correct if

739
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:28,330
it's MPLS encapsulation there should be

740
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:31,390
a girl label before ice age any further

741
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:33,150
comments or questions so yeah just a

742
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,609
question for clarification about whether

743
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:39,280
so you're defining the encapsulation for

744
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:41,770
an encapsulation for B F D over B X line

745
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,160
in an evpn context in this draft as well

746
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,630
as having the separate separate draft

747
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,540
which is with the iesg i believe at the

748
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:53,590
moment for BFD encapsulation in case

749
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:55,270
that I would have expected this document

750
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,310
to talk more about how you've structured

751
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:59,530
the FD session with bgp and things like

752
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:08,980
that in an e ven environment and not the

753
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:14,410
actual encapsulation because again new

754
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:19,420
on a common and then it broke no I do

755
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:22,299
agree because we're not defining we are

756
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:25,000
reflecting so if the working group

757
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,640
believes that it's too much information

758
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,570
it's duplication and just simple

759
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:34,150
reference will do that makes sense

760
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:36,520
similar with their MPLS as a Rashaad

761
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:39,760
pointed out basically it should not be

762
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:44,170
any different from what we know we're

763
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:47,860
using the gal it might be a paragraph

764
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:50,220
without diagram but yes bootstrapping is

765
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,020
the most important we have one of

766
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:58,529
bootstrapping mechanism already defined

767
00:42:53,020 --> 00:43:00,980
in MVP M fest failover so if this the

768
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,349
mechanism needs to be in hand

769
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,830
then definitely this is the right place

770
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:05,830
to do it

771
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:17,509
so what do the jurors think is the best

772
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,430
path forward so I I think we need to

773
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:22,700
have a have a discussion with with the

774
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:25,819
VFD chairs again well where I think

775
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,339
where the VFD encapsulation for specific

776
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,460
in specific specific application for a

777
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:33,980
specific first president application

778
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,900
resides because because of this existing

779
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:42,080
grant there's a number of encapsulation

780
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,510
Zini VPN that you can use each of which

781
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,119
you could put PFD over but there's

782
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,400
probably a more common mechanism for

783
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,510
constructing a session doesn't mean it

784
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,670
shouldn't very nutter with what the

785
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,940
encapsulation is a bit stronger thank

786
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,130
you

787
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:59,710
yep which perhaps that's a joke here

788
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,710
because I'll be specific to evpn okay I

789
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:30,830
guess there will be discussions thank

790
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:34,339
you good afternoon this is Linda temple

791
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:39,700
from future why so here I'm going to

792
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:43,130
talk more about how do we use PGP on to

793
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,790
manage overlay Network and here's

794
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:49,310
sd-1 per se but really is about

795
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:54,349
connecting clouds and connecting dynamic

796
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:59,720
locations so this is in a format of 83

797
00:44:54,349 --> 00:45:03,470
RC 8388 that job has description how do

798
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:06,399
we use PGP to handle VPN so are using

799
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,799
that template and here the the Colossus

800
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,950
and

801
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:18,280
now go to the detail so scenarios on

802
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,359
Monday actually we're discussing the RTG

803
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:25,320
working group about network to cloud

804
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:28,780
different scenarios and here we actually

805
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:33,280
elaborate much more than what being

806
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:37,240
discussing the RTG working group so for

807
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:40,140
the first scenario like homogeneous sd-1

808
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,990
we talked about like a shopping mall or

809
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:49,089
cloud datacenter you instantiate virtual

810
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:53,680
CPE and allow traffic to be encrypted to

811
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:58,270
all your other PS or actually it's like

812
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:02,080
remote PE connecting to all the VPN PE

813
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:05,410
so that's just showing that all the

814
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:08,799
traffic from there can be encrypted to

815
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:11,500
their destinations not showing on this

816
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,580
picture but it's describing the drug I

817
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:18,820
encourage people to read it showing that

818
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:23,020
the remote a node in the cloud could

819
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:27,280
need to connect to remote nodes through

820
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:33,759
the VPN so the traffic can trim passing

821
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:36,820
the PE and also that for the remote CPE

822
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,610
you could have they call it internet

823
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:44,380
local drop out meaning some of the

824
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:49,120
traffic don't get encrypted the second

825
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:52,510
scenario is about when we have CPEs

826
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:56,410
in different locations including cloud

827
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:58,600
locations where you have some ports

828
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:02,350
which is that existing ports connecting

829
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,180
to the VPN service providers and some

830
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:08,700
other ports being connected to the

831
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:12,759
Internet this is more applicable to

832
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,279
enterprise themselves they buy service

833
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,010
from VPN service provider and they

834
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,080
decide to adding a few more ports to

835
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:21,070
interconnect them together and also

836
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,130
interconnect

837
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,490
you clown locations which the current

838
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:30,550
service providers don't provide

839
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:34,149
connectivity's to the same scenario is

840
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:36,220
about today's VPN service providers

841
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:40,600
actually many of those small service

842
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:43,180
providers even large ones they use MPLS

843
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:47,319
to interconnect all the PE s and they do

844
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:51,040
have internet dropout local branch out

845
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:55,510
or over congested routes to be able to

846
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,790
connect all the PE s by internet not all

847
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:00,820
the P some of the piece when were the

848
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:07,360
suggestions as a temporary solution for

849
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:11,160
expansion so in this document in the

850
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:15,010
best working group we focus primarily on

851
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,420
usage requirement like in order to

852
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,630
achieve this what are the key

853
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:24,220
requirements and demonstrate how PGP can

854
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:28,330
achieve this purpose the the key

855
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:32,980
requirement is that three parts right so

856
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:35,020
one part is very important for the zero

857
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:38,050
touch provisioning and they were touch

858
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,900
provisioning meaning you have a box you

859
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,320
ship it to your customer they power it

860
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,640
up

861
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,180
they are supposed to be able to work

862
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:49,839
right away so normally the box shipped

863
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:52,390
out will have burned address to your

864
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,760
central controller which is not the

865
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:57,129
robbery flag rot reflector we talked

866
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,740
about here is really a central

867
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:02,710
controller the remote device reached

868
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:05,620
there and based on the location of this

869
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:09,970
remote device and the controller will

870
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:11,859
designate a local network control for

871
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:16,060
this particular device based on the

872
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:21,160
proximity of the of the node and another

873
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:23,740
important part is the remote device they

874
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,379
may have attached applications need to

875
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,890
reach the far end and but they don't

876
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:34,630
really know where is the remote device

877
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:37,540
remote CPE because although CPS can be

878
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:41,290
having private addresses or maybe even

879
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:43,210
have addresses not reachable by IP they

880
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,759
may have a identifier even though they

881
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:49,150
may have this 32 bits and then if I

882
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,430
similar to IP address is not routable in

883
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:54,910
the internet so they need to go through

884
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:59,200
the their own local controller be able

885
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:02,710
to establish the proper channel tunnel

886
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,200
or channel to the designated peers are

887
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:08,350
authorized peers and so those three P's

888
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,060
can be geographically in different

889
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,759
locations in different cities and

890
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:15,670
different countries here I show that one

891
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,520
tenant could have CP 1 CP in Dallas

892
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:20,890
another CP in Beijing and they have

893
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,310
their own local controller to be able to

894
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,900
control the connection between them

895
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:29,110
control the authentication between them

896
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:34,810
and they control the policy between them

897
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:38,620
so that's a very important part and the

898
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:41,320
reason we chose BGP is because why

899
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:44,560
deployment of BGP and very minimum

900
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,220
learning required and also all the

901
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:51,910
mechanisms supported by GP GP that

902
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:59,109
incremental update all those already

903
00:50:51,910 --> 00:51:03,730
inherited there so for scenario one in a

904
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:06,340
document talks about how the traffic in

905
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:10,360
provision the example walks through I

906
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:13,800
don't have time to you illustrate those

907
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:17,350
details in the high level the key

908
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:20,080
deployment is like a lot of law office

909
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:24,069
into office in the past they may have

910
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:28,410
just IP accessible but because of so

911
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:30,780
many cloud applications and they need

912
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:34,210
interconnection between themselves

913
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:38,080
securely to their cloud applications

914
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:40,840
there may also seek enterprises which

915
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,029
they already have campus network and now

916
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,190
suddenly they have lots of workload

917
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,980
being instantiated in different

918
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:48,990
locations different

919
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,359
bruh clouds and they need to have

920
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:55,790
instant connection and the key thing is

921
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:59,880
the those devices can be ephemeral

922
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:02,310
different from our CPE a device in the

923
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,490
routing domain been talking for decades

924
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:07,140
we have a CPE we configure them and they

925
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:11,520
are working we have connection to them

926
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:14,640
the key is in error here is based on the

927
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:17,280
demand based on the application and

928
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,400
today they may need enterprise may need

929
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,829
their workload to be extension in

930
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,770
Montreal and there may be a month later

931
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:27,510
depending on their user Geographic

932
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:31,259
requirement they may need to instantiate

933
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:34,859
similar application in say Dallas or in

934
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,770
Brazil and that's why st-1 come into the

935
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:39,420
picture being able to quickly

936
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:45,500
interconnect those workload and more

937
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:48,900
importantly is once you connect to the

938
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:51,359
remote nodes and those ramona's may need

939
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,390
to talk to each other so communicate

940
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:59,700
with each other

941
00:52:53,390 --> 00:53:02,819
the evpn secure VPN as a draft already

942
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:05,879
identified for different grant narrative

943
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:09,390
minority of the IPSec management and

944
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:16,349
also how to secure those evpn when the

945
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:18,839
PE is not directly connected and over

946
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:22,109
there they have detailed the scheme on

947
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:27,450
how to manage the key mechanism using

948
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:32,279
bgp Emma appears for the second

949
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:36,000
scenarios so it's becoming Motty players

950
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:39,740
it's not just enterprise and network

951
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,240
service providers now we're introducing

952
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:45,629
enterprises their network service

953
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,390
providers and cloud providers in this

954
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:52,410
example it shows that my remote router

955
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:54,540
is instantiate in the in the cloud

956
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,899
datacenter right so in a cloud

957
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:00,779
datacenter normally mostly cloud

958
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:04,110
operators allow multiple

959
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:06,720
access you can have IPSec access you can

960
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:09,360
have the rat connection access so as a

961
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,830
virtual router themself they have

962
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,800
different access and different

963
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:17,370
connections and they will have be able

964
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:19,790
to get information on the performance of

965
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:23,220
each network and make local decisions

966
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:26,550
whether certain traffic can go through

967
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:29,430
the IPSec tunnel to the destinations or

968
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:32,420
they can go through the and parents

969
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:35,669
network natively without encryption

970
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:40,380
encryption itself is very processing

971
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:44,640
expensive and the volume cannot be huge

972
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:47,580
so still to most enterprises it

973
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,190
preferable to use most of the secure

974
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:53,250
translate transport using them their

975
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:56,250
direct connect and MPLS network only for

976
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:59,250
the one that other networks congested or

977
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:02,640
when some traffic are not important they

978
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:05,760
can go through the internet and in this

979
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:09,480
example I didn't show that you could

980
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,820
have multiple virtual routers in

981
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,990
different cloud data centers how they

982
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:19,230
are connected with each other yes the

983
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:22,109
many cloud operators offer connectivity

984
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:25,080
among themselves but many enterprises

985
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:27,930
still want to see the being visible to

986
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,509
see how they are connected they may halt

987
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,970
backhaul they're helping the traffic all

988
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:34,860
the way back to their customer gateway

989
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,049
and using a customer gateway to

990
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,900
interconnect the traffic between

991
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:42,930
different cloud data centers as shown in

992
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:47,700
this example we have data center one

993
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:50,490
data center to the BGP route reflected

994
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,950
here is running in different areas

995
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:55,379
different instance from the underlay

996
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:57,629
Network they are connected to the

997
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,630
virtual devices they connect to the

998
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:06,270
remote devices and they are managing the

999
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:08,640
route between all those devices and it's

1000
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:11,040
important that for some of those

1001
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,810
applications especially they were touch

1002
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:17,110
provisioning once the Box powers are

1003
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:20,580
and the box himself virtual or vertical

1004
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:23,410
or physical they can detect the

1005
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:26,410
attachments and those attachments has to

1006
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:28,810
be escalated to the controller to decide

1007
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:31,080
whether those attachments are valid or

1008
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,080
not valid

1009
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:39,310
what's the narrow number three is more

1010
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:43,660
about the PS today you are connecting

1011
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:46,390
you already have MPs interconnected one

1012
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:49,299
there's overflow there you add the

1013
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:52,150
Internet ports so that you can utilize

1014
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,730
the Internet and the key things here is

1015
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:57,490
actually the security because in the

1016
00:56:54,730 --> 00:57:00,730
past the peas are interconnected by the

1017
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:05,080
underlay network and is secure and this

1018
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:07,750
within the administrative domain of the

1019
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:10,090
operators and now suddenly you open an

1020
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:13,030
Internet Court all kinds of threats

1021
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:15,250
could coming even though you make we get

1022
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:17,650
a request from certain provider and

1023
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:20,500
certain notes and the colleague spoofing

1024
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:28,050
they could be DDoS all kinds of tech or

1025
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:31,030
come see another key requirement we

1026
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:35,220
demonstrate in the in a draft is talking

1027
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:39,660
about site based forwarding meaning that

1028
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:41,890
for certain applications they may have

1029
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:45,790
application money in different sites and

1030
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:47,980
it's very important for the routes to

1031
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:50,350
reach certain size this really the

1032
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:54,610
policy like you may reach certain sites

1033
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:56,560
that one each note is fine but in in

1034
00:57:54,610 --> 00:58:00,390
some other application you can now reach

1035
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:02,830
certain sites so for the BGP route

1036
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:06,400
distribution and the port distribution

1037
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:14,230
site has to be included in one of the

1038
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:18,220
attributes so in a in a draft talk some

1039
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:20,940
more examples like for scenario one how

1040
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,680
the device being powered up how the

1041
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:27,370
client routes being distributed to other

1042
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:30,549
nodes which is very similar to a VPN

1043
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:34,660
and there's also inform scenario number

1044
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:37,180
two that how the one ports need to be

1045
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:39,129
registered with the controller here in

1046
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,589
the best working group we don't talk

1047
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:46,450
about how those encoding are down we are

1048
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:50,740
only focusing on the actual content need

1049
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:52,960
to be registered and in the idea working

1050
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:55,629
group we had a drug talking about

1051
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,330
encoding by yesterday that she asked us

1052
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:00,640
not to get your details to the encoding

1053
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:04,540
because that many different ways to skin

1054
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,700
a cat and idea Cheers want us to focus

1055
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:09,970
on the detailed requirement the

1056
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:12,129
substance of content to be forwarded

1057
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,529
between the rail reflector and device

1058
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:19,810
and then later are we can explain the

1059
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:22,390
encoding and for the client service

1060
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:26,529
provisioning that the difference may be

1061
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:28,779
is more like the device itself detect

1062
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,550
the routes and reported a controller and

1063
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:33,070
then controller coming back with the

1064
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,930
policy of what rounds are allowed with

1065
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,640
routers not allowed for the allowed

1066
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:39,190
routes and they will be propagated to

1067
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:44,950
their peers and if we're not allowed

1068
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:47,230
routes can be dropped so here just the

1069
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:51,819
summary of the control plan the

1070
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:54,430
components for the component itself they

1071
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:57,670
need to the end notes when powered up

1072
00:59:54,430 --> 01:00:00,250
may not even have a IP address and maybe

1073
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:03,750
have a burning ID and which is not

1074
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:08,170
routable and the ports connecting to

1075
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:11,670
ISPs they may get assigned IP address

1076
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:15,340
then some of the ports may have assigned

1077
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:18,040
DHCP dynamic IP address or private

1078
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:20,740
address so it is important for the 1

1079
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,800
port addresses to be reported to the

1080
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:27,759
rail reflector if CP you wanna need to

1081
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,230
talk to CP 2 and CP 3 the if they are

1082
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,350
also right to communicate with each

1083
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:34,870
other those one port addresses and how

1084
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:37,540
the private how the net

1085
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:41,290
has to be propagated to the remote site

1086
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:44,590
just like ATM days they have this NH RP

1087
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:47,220
for the address resolution the local

1088
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:52,440
address to the one address resolution

1089
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,439
similar things has to be done here and

1090
01:00:52,980 --> 01:01:00,220
answer part is the IPSec management

1091
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:03,930
there were lots of discussions yesterday

1092
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:06,580
I don't have to get into that to detail

1093
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:13,419
that's it any questions

1094
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:14,770
a Salina Cisco Systems you certainly got

1095
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,590
your mileage out of these slides I think

1096
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:20,940
this is the fourth time I've seen them

1097
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:23,820
thank you because we get comments and

1098
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:27,820
focus is different here is more about

1099
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:29,890
walks through the scenarios and how the

1100
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,740
client being how the device being

1101
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:36,490
brought up and how the flow goes through

1102
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:40,299
and a leading assisted us we need to a

1103
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:46,870
drive to describe how those things I

1104
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:54,360
used how PGP I used any other questions

1105
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:54,359
okay thank you

1106
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:21,080
greenie

1107
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:23,210
m'kay some training Sammy from Cisco so

1108
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,860
I'm just presenting this on we have a

1109
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:30,200
fall author's this is going to be quick

1110
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,820
a bit on the existing draft should brief

1111
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,299
overview it was was the only person

1112
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,750
today that right if 99 so what is this

1113
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:39,670
all about

1114
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:43,070
so this draft defense procedure to do

1115
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:45,560
seamless interpret wean EVP in and MIT

1116
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:47,900
networks and the same procedure can also

1117
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,660
be used to do optimize to intercept at

1118
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:53,500
forwarding with an EVP in fabrics we

1119
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:56,060
have very good support from industry and

1120
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,770
this is a revision for there are some

1121
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:01,610
comments on loosen three which we have

1122
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:05,300
addressed here so these are main

1123
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:07,070
comments one s the proposal doesn't

1124
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,780
provide to Ethernet emulation for

1125
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:11,990
intercepted traffic because we always

1126
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:14,390
use routing approach between two

1127
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:17,569
different ease so even interest of the

1128
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:21,049
topic will also get routed then second

1129
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:22,970
committees we don't this graph doesn't

1130
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:26,540
cover eevee eevee pian and the MEP and

1131
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:30,290
Gateway model so if you look at the

1132
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:33,350
module draft what we proposed so the

1133
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:36,290
solution is really meant for evpn and a

1134
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:39,500
VPN being on the same fabrics but you

1135
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:41,900
can also connect a million networks to

1136
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,620
subset of EVP in fabrics that is not

1137
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,640
covered so that phone of the comment and

1138
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:50,500
third comment is you know are the

1139
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,500
configuration needed a new in peace

1140
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:57,050
so in Division four we are a new section

1141
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:59,359
which talks about you know how to take

1142
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:01,520
care of tickle problems basically on the

1143
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:04,070
ingre side we don't decrement any TTL

1144
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:06,560
and we don't clear it a nice host Mac it

1145
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:10,769
will get forwarded as it is and regress

1146
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:12,839
right based on source BD

1147
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:16,879
we will decide the leftover out or

1148
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:16,880
bridge on the outgoing interface

1149
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:22,559
regarding MEP need a ve we can get your

1150
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,930
model CBR a new section which talks

1151
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,660
about get a model and there are two

1152
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:31,049
scenarios where to get a model can be

1153
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:34,019
used one is if you use two different

1154
01:04:31,049 --> 01:04:36,089
tunnel between MEP and evpn a P then we

1155
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:39,419
have Q's get a model so other thing is

1156
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:41,490
if you if a medium P is are connected to

1157
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:46,440
subset of EB thin piece that time also

1158
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:47,549
we can just use get a model so for our P

1159
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,099
configuration we are at more

1160
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:52,920
collaterally so we are as section which

1161
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:56,190
talks about very sarpy configuration use

1162
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,289
cases and we also clarified that in unit

1163
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:01,380
in fabrics we don't have to explicitly

1164
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:03,180
configure out the configuration there

1165
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:05,880
are some other minor changes that we

1166
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:08,098
just made say one of a command which

1167
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,170
talks about in optimum forwarding can

1168
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:12,119
only only be done if you use the same

1169
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:15,450
tunnel type so that we just are no

1170
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:19,079
updated and two new one that we have

1171
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:23,640
added to you know for the completeness

1172
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:27,150
purposes and there were some comment

1173
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:28,940
that was made that even eveything only

1174
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:31,670
fabrics venereal treaty in conjugation

1175
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:35,369
so we clarify that that's not needed

1176
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:36,450
then again hosted advertisement or a kid

1177
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:39,539
for MEP in peace

1178
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:41,399
that's only when MEP is part of youth in

1179
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:45,779
fabrics not for the get your model that

1180
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:48,390
also be clarified next steps so this has

1181
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:52,619
been our for three years and we have two

1182
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:54,328
different implementation and again it's

1183
01:05:52,619 --> 01:06:01,380
all in production we have 50 plus

1184
01:05:54,329 --> 01:06:07,109
deployments a Turkish team who has

1185
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:11,670
ratchet arrived okay who thinks it is

1186
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:16,069
ready for walking or production and it's

1187
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:20,239
very the objection to adopt the document

1188
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:20,239
okay we will take it to the list

1189
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:40,220
okay less presentation hello my name is

1190
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:44,960
Sri Hari I'm gonna present a bgp VPN

1191
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:46,580
services on a service Express alright so

1192
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,230
talk about looting of background and the

1193
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:51,110
problem statement and then let's see

1194
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:55,040
what the proposals are okay so yes our

1195
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:57,290
v6 + Ron Monica has presented in couple

1196
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:00,320
of working groups and this is just a

1197
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:03,200
very short primer on what is relevant

1198
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,690
for this particular draft SR v6 +

1199
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,540
provides a unidirectional connectivity

1200
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:11,570
between two nodes it introduces

1201
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:13,730
programmable instructions the draft

1202
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,470
talks about there is a segment

1203
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:19,520
instruction there is a path instruction

1204
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:23,750
and it relies exclusively on ipv6 data

1205
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:25,580
plain talk about bgp bgp VPN services or

1206
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:31,700
on multiple different various types of

1207
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:35,569
tunnels could be MPLS IP GRE and that so

1208
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:37,240
let's look at the simple VPN topology as

1209
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:43,250
shown in the diagram here

1210
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:46,580
sr v 6 plus underlay relies on the PPS I

1211
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:49,880
the poor path segment instruction what

1212
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:55,250
it does is at the piece the P is P 1 and

1213
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:57,200
P 2 they allocate the P psi and that is

1214
01:07:55,250 --> 01:08:00,470
what that is used for identifying which

1215
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,649
particular connect seee that you need to

1216
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:05,868
send it to P psi is embedded in the

1217
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:09,230
destination opsin options header and

1218
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:11,270
ipv6 Tunnel and pier routers or P or

1219
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:14,630
ipv6 capable and they are not P psi

1220
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:15,859
cable so the P is distributed the

1221
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:18,170
service instructions like we talked

1222
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:22,729
about whether it is IP or a VPN in a

1223
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:25,160
arise so how do we use VT P to enable a

1224
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:28,939
service Express connectivity on the ant

1225
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:31,019
way so we have the mechanism already in

1226
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:33,569
the tunnel encapsulation attribute

1227
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,850
Divine's what sort of tunnels you can

1228
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:38,759
have between the two PE routers so we're

1229
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:41,640
gonna leverage that a survey 6 plus path

1230
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,290
is considered as a tunnel and we are

1231
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,430
gonna request for a service Express

1232
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:49,340
tunnel type and that sub tlvs

1233
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,690
as defined in the talent captivation a

1234
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:54,480
document whether this terminal endpoint

1235
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:56,339
or protocol type or the color can be

1236
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,040
used but some of the other sub GL ways

1237
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:01,380
are not necessarily needed like the DES

1238
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,979
field or UD participation port and

1239
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,779
things so that specifically they

1240
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:08,969
embedded label handling sub TLV we are

1241
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:10,229
asking for another code point here the

1242
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,060
dock in the tunnel encapsulation

1243
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:15,809
document talks about four point one and

1244
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:19,380
two I'm asking for a tunnel type the

1245
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:22,320
code type 3 which indicates that the

1246
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,630
ingress when you have this particular

1247
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,460
tunnel type at the encapsulation of the

1248
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:29,310
external label handling sub tlbs 3

1249
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:33,300
you're going to use the P psi and embed

1250
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:37,230
in the destination options header so in

1251
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:41,610
other words the l3 or evpn encoding

1252
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:43,290
trick the PPS a as a embedded label some

1253
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:48,799
coding encoding examples have only taken

1254
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:54,630
to the office of a1 128 as well as the

1255
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:56,670
EDR out on the a VPN side you can

1256
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:58,500
clearly see that all others are

1257
01:09:56,670 --> 01:10:01,800
maintained except when it comes to the

1258
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:04,320
label field you embed the PPS identify

1259
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,640
you and along with that you you will be

1260
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:11,240
sending that unlink cancellation path

1261
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,240
attribute where you say the SPV is a v6

1262
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:28,080
and the proposal on the various bgp

1263
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:29,969
procedures on the ekeus PE the PPS

1264
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,309
things are soldered with the forwarding

1265
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:35,250
table and that is useful D mixing in the

1266
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:37,650
dáil plane and P psi is encoded as

1267
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,540
embedded label like we talked about and

1268
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:43,170
the tow line condition attribute is

1269
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:44,790
advertised with that NL RI and the

1270
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:47,040
ingress PE

1271
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:50,760
PPSA is constructed with the embedded

1272
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:54,570
label that is three bytes and appending

1273
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:58,200
the the top border byte 0 that's the p

1274
01:10:54,570 --> 01:11:01,799
PSI that is used in the dissipation

1275
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:04,620
options header that the wrong bond

1276
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,570
occurs draft talks about and this topple

1277
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:08,550
the PPS identifier and the prefix is

1278
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,460
what there is programmed in the s5 the

1279
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:15,000
segments forwarding table

1280
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:16,260
now when the in the actual data plane in

1281
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,760
the destination options centre of the

1282
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:23,340
tunnel after tunnel header the ingress

1283
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,230
PE inserts the p PSI in the destination

1284
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,340
of some header the P routers do not

1285
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,839
process it because this is the

1286
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:31,640
destination of consider in the last

1287
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:35,010
header so it's only looked up by the

1288
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,930
final egress PE and and that is what

1289
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:40,620
that is used for identifying where to

1290
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:42,420
send the packet questions comments and

1291
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:48,930
going to present this in IDR working

1292
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:51,230
group as well so any comments I am call

1293
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:54,180
here over on Nokia yeah a few comments

1294
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:57,690
so the first one is here the title of

1295
01:11:54,180 --> 01:12:00,000
the Travis says IDR but I really think

1296
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:02,400
it belongs in here so it's a best

1297
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,290
wrapped sure I mean yes exactly this

1298
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:09,780
father comments that I wanted to mate

1299
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:11,580
this is clearly a BGP sounds like VP and

1300
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,349
so this is the world that referring to

1301
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:19,410
the best responsibility

1302
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:23,610
John do you have any objection ok ok

1303
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:28,830
posted ok this is Steven individual

1304
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:30,750
draft so yeah yeah second comment when

1305
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:33,780
you describe the another eyes for

1306
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:37,710
different about types you say label

1307
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:41,969
equal P psi but I really think you you

1308
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:43,740
mean lower 24 bits of the P psi right so

1309
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:46,490
I'm gonna rewrite that you should

1310
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:49,410
correct that sure I'm gonna be what and

1311
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:53,010
next comment is that there's a section

1312
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:56,220
that you say that a label is downstream

1313
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:58,270
allocated except for p2 MP in that case

1314
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,720
you its upstream allocated

1315
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:03,280
there is no key to empty in here right

1316
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,980
and there's four EVP and there's no

1317
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,530
point of multi-point 0.0 so you should

1318
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:09,250
remove that part of the that section

1319
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:12,730
sure

1320
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:15,250
and finally uh well you you are asking

1321
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:18,940
for a working group adoption but I think

1322
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:21,160
there is still a lot to to go till that

1323
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:24,190
point right still first I have to be

1324
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,690
adopted in a spring and then the headers

1325
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:28,290
and then this is probably their last

1326
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:30,360
step sounds good you know thinking

1327
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:33,010
Thanks

1328
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,790
okay little arcus I think the draft is

1329
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,290
very well written

1330
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:38,080
I've been through it I may have missed

1331
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:42,010
out but in control plane when you carry

1332
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:45,360
this attribute you are expecting it to

1333
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:49,780
be stripped off at the ingress of the

1334
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:52,660
tunnel or you want to leak it further if

1335
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:54,160
if the SR v6 + NL RI is going to be

1336
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,110
propagated the internal in transition

1337
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,900
attribute has to go even if the next

1338
01:13:56,110 --> 01:14:01,330
stop gets rewritten even if the next

1339
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,190
stop gets rewritten sorry I didn't

1340
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:05,910
follow even the next one even if the

1341
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:07,719
next hop gets rewritten at ebgp boundary

1342
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:10,240
next job gets deleted

1343
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:12,400
I'm written or rewritten okay sorry the

1344
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:15,460
next one is rewritten then you probably

1345
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,320
want to strip it right right so that I

1346
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,370
think that text is missing you probably

1347
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:23,349
won't look at it I'm gonna add that

1348
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:26,559
chunk you okay thanks okay I fully agree

1349
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:29,680
with what Horace said it's clearly too

1350
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:32,230
too early to add a document or even to

1351
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,320
do an abduction call because we need to

1352
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:36,070
agree at the IETF level especially in

1353
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:40,150
spring

1354
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:42,790
Eve service expressed concept that you

1355
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:46,210
are trying to push is something that we

1356
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:49,810
want in spring and if it is accepted of

1357
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:51,430
course this is a world that such we

1358
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:54,250
address into going to the best working

1359
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:57,490
hope something that we need to go step

1360
01:14:54,250 --> 01:15:02,640
by step okay sounds Minister any other

1361
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:02,639
questions thank you

1362
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:08,630
[Music]

1363
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:14,389
so I think we are done for today and for

1364
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:15,950
this ATF so see you in Singapore and if

1365
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:18,760
you have the blue sheets could you bring

1366
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,760
them to the front place
