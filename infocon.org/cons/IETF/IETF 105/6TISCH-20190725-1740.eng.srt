1
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,259
[Music]

2
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:20,310
this is not a Kiwi six over flying

3
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:22,049
objects so if you're looking for sixty

4
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,179
show in the right room otherwise maybe

5
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,890
it's right time to leave we are going to

6
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:31,020
start the meeting if the guys at the end

7
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,420
of the meeting could close the door that

8
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:41,880
would be really appreciated so do we

9
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:47,039
have minutes taker we do oh thanks twice

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,350
do we the links well yeah I I went

11
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:53,450
through all of them and maybe it's the

12
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,449
magic of powerpoints but they were fixed

13
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:16,400
so I thought 105 Hey

14
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:16,400
so I misunderstood my email

15
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:42,170
let's rice can I do that okay so this is

16
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:44,450
six dish we have a short meeting so we

17
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,059
have one hour we'll be going mostly

18
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,899
through the interesting piece which is

19
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,239
the security the minimum security let's

20
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,940
go and all the security discussion that

21
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,370
we've had a day ascend so I asked

22
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,170
militia to actually do something which

23
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,150
is a bit unusual which is spend more

24
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,548
time and talk about you know how things

25
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,200
work I supposed to just say like we

26
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,329
usually do here is what changes

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,879
everybody's okay let's move on right so

28
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:14,060
I I really wanted to have a technical

29
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,459
discussion on security and close up the

30
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,260
security section of many more and we

31
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,299
have Tejo and may sign the room so I am

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,668
quite confident that we will achieve

33
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:27,590
that so this is my HF meeting the usual

34
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,359
notwell applies if you are aware of any

35
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,780
IPR which applies something which is

36
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,400
discussed today either you refrain from

37
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,440
participating or you announce the APR

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,510
from you for your sponsor form or ever

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,859
you're aware of if you don't want to do

40
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,018
that are in the meeting please come to

41
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,099
the chairs at the end of the meeting

42
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,079
it's not the only best practice that

43
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,238
applies to this meeting now a number of

44
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,269
best practices there are listed serious

45
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,799
of apply to harassment and the way the

46
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,269
working groups operate all of those best

47
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,700
practices apply to this meeting we are

48
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,519
being recorded by Michiko actually they

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,160
will publish the recording on YouTube

50
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,680
and what's even better you can click on

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,840
some sessions on some part of the blue

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,879
YouTube thing and you can get the

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,410
transcript it's not perfect but it's

54
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,078
kind of impressive that we are there

55
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:18,469
there so it's being recorded it's being

56
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,478
transcripted you'll be on video if you

57
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,419
want if you come to talk you better sit

58
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,169
on on this red cross that's behind my

59
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:28,580
feet so so you'll be so nice on video

60
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,990
we'll be passing the blue sheets in like

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,380
10 minutes because we are used to the

62
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,930
crowd

63
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,310
which comes a bit late so we better pass

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,230
the blue sheets with a little bit of

65
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,430
delay as well and captures better the

66
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,200
people in the room usual links so they

67
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:46,190
are mostly right and unless they are

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,070
wrong and so the etherpad should not

69
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,940
have tools that's that's okay so remove

70
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,230
tools and the P should not be down there

71
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,590
oh it should be I don't know I mean

72
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:00,380
since it changed I'm not sure so the

73
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,349
usual intro status really we'll go

74
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,670
through the agenda by seeing if you hand

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,980
up you win anything in this edge on that

76
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,750
please let us know now so we'll give you

77
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,270
a status of what has been around in the

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,570
working groups that six station tough

79
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,219
years with will give you a status the

80
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,380
architecture that's going to be me then

81
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,140
I'll pass the ball to Manisha and as I

82
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,000
said militia will go through the

83
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,690
operation of many more and in particular

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,100
the resolution of the the issues that we

85
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,900
found discussing the sixties

86
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:37,040
architectural security section and then

87
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,929
Michael is here Oh is the new ok so

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,270
Michael will discuss two drafts and I

89
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,530
have slides only for one so I expect

90
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:48,830
that for the other you can live without

91
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:50,150
slides unless you send them right now

92
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,870
and I can push them but I don't have a

93
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,320
level and Micucci Luka asked us to be

94
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,850
pushed at the very end of the meeting so

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,909
we did this this swap in the in the

96
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,740
agenda Michaels draft and the dynamic

97
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,330
scheduling things were swapped it

98
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,160
doesn't mean that Michael can spend all

99
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,440
the time in the world and and consume

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,440
MSF time it's not a matter of priority

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,750
so Michael please stay within your

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,050
schedule and we'll be all right

103
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,700
so since HF 104 what happens is quite

104
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,070
progress at six slow so you know we

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,620
depend on the backbone router

106
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,480
drugs and at rest protection thing for

107
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,640
the body architecture induced to have

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,680
progressed best let's go and they are in

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:37,370
the careful hands of Suresh the fragment

110
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,710
drawers I've also been fast let's go at

111
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,360
six low there is a little bit question

112
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,430
about whether the first of those two

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,190
should be informational Astana truck

114
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,320
because the second

115
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,120
one uses it and it's down the track so

116
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,270
there is no match if done right if the

117
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,530
first one is is just informational so

118
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,210
it's surest to give us guidance there

119
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,289
reported away leave which is also a nice

120
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,180
thing for us is that up to the troll a

121
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:07,020
score on which we depend from Minnie

122
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,660
more is RFC and so the last thing that

123
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,430
was reacting us which is the the dislike

124
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,680
discussion is now happening and there

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,490
was above at this HF and that's where

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,900
haddock could see it if it's adapted we

127
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,400
have seen a number of things which

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,789
happening that relates to us in

129
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,770
different working groups at this point

130
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,990
of time the most interesting is probably

131
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,849
the animal constraint vulture so I

132
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,890
expect that when you talk about euro

133
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,340
touch Michael will give us the status on

134
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,800
the constraint vulture as well and here

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,599
is the kind of a snapshot of the result

136
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,810
activity on the milestone so that's

137
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,180
where Suresh you've heard about us

138
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:51,450
recently so another good number of our

139
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:55,350
milestones on our green and we are added

140
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,570
to my stands for the MSF and for the

141
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,370
announce beacon because we adopted a

142
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,169
non-speaking and Michael will talk to us

143
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,030
about it it's a very simple draft very

144
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:09,450
useful so we expect to progresses

145
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:11,429
rapidly now and then will be well we'll

146
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,530
discuss what happens to zero touch but

147
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,070
pretty much everything will be complete

148
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,539
so between now and Singapore we'll be in

149
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,510
a situation where the working group has

150
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,280
completed its job so we'll be facing two

151
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,530
possibilities we close the working group

152
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,159
which is perfectly fine we are done we

153
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,960
happy we call it victory or we look at

154
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,300
the one thing that we started with and

155
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,010
we never completed which is scheduling

156
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,909
time slots for the gmpls operation that

157
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,189
we've been discussing at the very

158
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,790
beginning initially I thought this could

159
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,940
go to the row a fault but the raw effort

160
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,610
will end up being a rotting area effort

161
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,470
dealing with layered

162
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,370
what happens above TCH but not within

163
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,050
TCH

164
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,000
meaning that it's a really orthogonal

165
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,560
work so row will not be

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,240
place for scheduling time slots 40s eh

167
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,630
meaning that we need to find a home for

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,790
it

169
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,880
and that could be a reason to reach out

170
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,660
or six - that's where I am so sorry that

171
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,250
that's the best I have at this moment so

172
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,719
here is what I challenge if you have any

173
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,490
question on this we've deleted

174
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,630
terminology because it was merged into

175
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,190
architecture and they're both in is your

176
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,780
review we passed most of the review I

177
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,200
guess we are all green some people did

178
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,780
not

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,400
maybe confirm to you Suresh but my best

180
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,400
knowledge is I have no pending action

181
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,680
okay so the architecture I said first

182
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,199
most of the reviews for the ASG so I

183
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,439
expect that will be in earth 48 very

184
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:22,900
soon now well in the we are in RFC edit

185
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,880
of queue already so rush maybe not no no

186
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,560
we're not but I expect to be there soon

187
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,120
so the queue there are people in the

188
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,510
queue so it will take the time it takes

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,010
but as far as I know the current version

190
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,580
of the architecture is very very close

191
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:39,040
in terms of content to the RFC we switch

192
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,510
some subsection from I level

193
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,189
architecture to components back and

194
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,689
forth because it's really depending on

195
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,510
on the reading of the different

196
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,180
reviewers so I try to be consistent and

197
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:54,880
and make sure that I did not undo for

198
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:58,989
one what I did for to work we had like

199
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,439
three revs for and addressed you know

200
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,300
for cease curry so thank you all another

201
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,150
big change was the security section

202
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,949
we've seen all the discussions and many

203
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,470
lists about the security section and

204
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,329
under review there so the

205
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,759
we hope you in the text right now the

206
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:19,180
gory details go actually in the minimal

207
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,339
draft and so that's what Manish on until

208
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,529
we'll be discussing today and then there

209
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,879
are many small it's also I won't list

210
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:30,009
them just look at the D 5000 interested

211
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,720
and that's pretty much it and Manisha if

212
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,860
you want to come in for the next any

213
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,860
question on the architecture

214
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,700
good afternoon my name is militia

215
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,100
alternate so I'll be on behalf of the

216
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,580
authors of draft ID f6 this minimal

217
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,400
security I will be presenting the

218
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,590
updates to the draft since the Prague

219
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,579
meeting as well as the latest

220
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:23,380
discussions that were that were recently

221
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,800
held on the mailing lists

222
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:31,120
so since Prague we had two versions

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,979
published we had version 10 and version

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,830
11 after Pascal's review Thank You

225
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,090
Pascal for the review we shipped the

226
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,890
document to thrush

227
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,530
but in the meantime we had an

228
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,480
overlapping discussion during the is a

229
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,760
review of the architecture that

230
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,470
influenced some of the texts that we

231
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,110
need to update in in minimum-security

232
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,650
draft so I will be summarizing that and

233
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,670
giving a proposed resolution and

234
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,740
essentially this is the goal of the

235
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,170
presentation today summary of changes in

236
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,900
10 and 11 and the discussion of the ASN

237
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:11,829
replay attack that is on the mailing

238
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:14,079
list so the update in 10 that was

239
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,690
discussed in Prague we found the

240
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,670
resolution that includes the expansion

241
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:23,680
of section 8 3 3 which concerns

242
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,640
essentially the scenario of the drawing

243
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,439
registrar and coordinator failing

244
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,640
partially failing essentially failing to

245
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,310
preserve mutable context parameters in

246
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,370
or score but able to preserve the

247
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:42,810
pre-shared keys from some database for

248
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:46,210
instance and the the pledged identifiers

249
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:49,560
so we had to recover from that and the

250
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:53,320
recovery process works as follows first

251
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,020
in case the failure occurs we rely on

252
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,600
out-of-band knowledge auto band

253
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,660
coordination between the jrc and this

254
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,020
end the 6lb are of the network such that

255
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,790
the network is very initialized then

256
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,850
once the network is reinitialized this

257
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,910
will essentially force all the old

258
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,759
no it's in the network to rejoin to send

259
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,579
the drawing requests as per draft

260
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:22,000
minimum as per a minimal security and a

261
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:24,339
normal join process but on the jrc side

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
we are we know that the failure happens

263
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:29,709
so we can reach that we can reject the

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,339
we can reject the first drawing request

265
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:36,099
in order to in order to prevent the

266
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,139
nonce reuse on the or score level in the

267
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:43,420
in the corresponding draw in response

268
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:46,300
and instead we trigger the we trigger

269
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:51,339
the this procedure that is defined in

270
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:54,300
oscar in RFC 86 13 that involves the

271
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:57,100
derivation of a new context I then a

272
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,469
context identifier so the procedure

273
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,490
works as follows

274
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,940
essentially for in the first drawing

275
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,730
request this is Azrael normal the kit

276
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,880
context parameter carries the eui-64 of

277
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,829
the of the pledge but the response

278
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,730
instead of the regular drawing response

279
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:18,069
now is the 401 unauthorized error

280
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,880
containing as kit context a random nonce

281
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:24,040
and this this context this message here

282
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,360
is protected with the concatenation of

283
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,399
eui-64 and the random nonce and which

284
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:35,439
triggers essentially the pledge to

285
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:38,470
derive a new to select an around a new

286
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:42,250
random number f3 to concatenate it with

287
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,649
our 2 and to protect the following join

288
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,920
join request that it makes to the

289
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:51,069
network and finally as the output of

290
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,800
this procedure from kit context that is

291
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:56,680
eui-64 of the pledge we end up with a

292
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,050
new kit context and fresh parameters

293
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,550
that Allah that pray allow us to prevent

294
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,589
the nonce reuse in the drawing response

295
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:10,630
so this procedure is entirely defined in

296
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:14,639
86 13 so we merely we merely reference

297
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:17,350
it in in minimum-security discussing

298
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,170
extensively the attack and what happens

299
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,759
why this procedure is needed so right

300
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,878
now the procedure is recommended with

301
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,059
the other option being that the provider

302
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:35,079
needs to go into the field and and

303
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:37,419
reprovision the devices so the second

304
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,819
update in 10 relates to the error

305
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:42,848
handling on the level of constraint

306
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:45,399
Rhoyne protocol so in the previous

307
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:48,939
version what we this update came after

308
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:52,149
Christians mail or discussion on the

309
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:55,988
mailing list and the issue in the

310
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:59,019
previous version was that the error

311
00:16:55,989 --> 00:17:01,689
signaling was not done in a restful way

312
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:04,870
such that the request was referencing a

313
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:07,029
previous request and it would it would

314
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:10,208
prevent essentially the server from

315
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:12,819
handling the drawing requests in a

316
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,009
stateful manner so essentially what we

317
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,918
did is that we redefined the cyber

318
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:21,059
structures that carry the parameters and

319
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,069
they now contain all the information for

320
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:27,730
the error handling to occur in a

321
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:31,240
stateless manner so essentially we it

322
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,820
works as before if the join join a

323
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:40,809
request fail if the processing of the

324
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:43,629
join response fails the the the further

325
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:47,190
the next subsequent the subsequent to

326
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:50,350
join requests will contain the Seaboard

327
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,320
unsupported configuration parameter that

328
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,139
will include essentially what went wrong

329
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,049
in a stateless manner and now we have

330
00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:01,209
this structure that is an array that

331
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:03,940
contained that carries unsupported

332
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,299
configuration that carries unsupported

333
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,480
parameter sequence of Seaboard elements

334
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:13,210
with code being unsupported on all Mart

335
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,539
form and the intent here being to signal

336
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,899
from the pledge to the Dre RC that it

337
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,940
cannot essentially configure some part

338
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:26,408
of the configuration that it received in

339
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,149
the response rain eternal from here I

340
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:33,369
was questioning the earth the previous

341
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:35,229
slide so one pledge can fail a join in

342
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:37,050
the whole network has to rejoin is that

343
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,700
you know

344
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,909
so it's the driver to start coordinator

345
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,600
that fails completely so it's the

346
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:49,000
failure event it's the failure event so

347
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,610
it's here it's the failure event of the

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,500
drawing register coordinator where the

349
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,629
Droid register coordinator loses all

350
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,970
their arm State for example but it is

351
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,580
able to retrieve pre-shared keys of all

352
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:07,120
the pledges that it manages in different

353
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:09,189
networks out there so it's the

354
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,899
implication of the attack is described

355
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,679
in the update the implication of the

356
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:20,890
attack is that the join response here

357
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:24,309
would would have to time pad on the

358
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:28,390
nonce essentially used for the drawing

359
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:30,670
response would be used Weiss such that

360
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,610
there would be a two time pad on the

361
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,320
join response so cryptographically the

362
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,270
security properties of the drawn

363
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:47,860
response was no longer failure and will

364
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:51,100
no longer hold I was just trying to

365
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,610
clarify this because that's a the force

366
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,719
one of our networks to rejoin is a huge

367
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,990
huge deal so I'm just gonna make sure

368
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,809
the bar was set high yes so this is yes

369
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:05,020
Michael Richardson here so so this is a

370
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:09,428
catastrophic kind of event where you

371
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,920
know the the plant is still alive but

372
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:14,590
the fire just the fire in the office

373
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,100
destroyed all the equipment okay that

374
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:20,949
operates the plant and afterwards you

375
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,280
buy new new servers and you restore from

376
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,230
backup but the backups don't have all

377
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,450
the aren't you know we're a month old

378
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,510
and so you don't have all the latest

379
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,520
information at this point you know you

380
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,870
have no front office back office you're

381
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,010
going around you're going to be pushing

382
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,800
buttons on every single thing is as we

383
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,629
initialize the whole Factory okay so yes

384
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,580
you're absolutely right but the point is

385
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,160
that that it would be terrible if you

386
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,909
also has to have to unmount all the

387
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,010
vice and put new PS kaizen though okay

388
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,380
so that's even worse at least all you

389
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,720
have to do is somehow power cycle them

390
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,280
and get them to keep going you don't

391
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:07,450
even need to power cycle than anything

392
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,280
yes you need to restart they go to sync

393
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,920
their memories run row please speak of

394
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,480
the night tonight you don't speak

395
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,280
because people actually think so taro

396
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,110
said that that they get out of sync

397
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,149
anyway because while while the

398
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,570
firefighters were there they got it they

399
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,620
sorry

400
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,020
while the firefighters were there

401
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,300
putting out the fire the the network

402
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,639
fell apart because they got out of sync

403
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,200
and so they all go back in to join state

404
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,310
again so you don't even have to do what

405
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,390
I just said I think it's a pair of

406
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,490
saying you don't have to push a button

407
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,630
everywhere they all just go oh my god

408
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,290
the network went away I have to

409
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,560
reinitialize

410
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:41,889
and as soon as you get that jrc server

411
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,050
back running okay you're good you've

412
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,500
restored the six week or six month old

413
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:49,389
backup or something like that and life

414
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,430
continues and this is what makes sure

415
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,200
that it continues can I think question

416
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,030
during all this time the network could

417
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,720
leave the way it was right you didn't

418
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,790
know that is to brutally stop it if if

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,740
the network kept going because it was

420
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,690
still had power then it would just keep

421
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,580
going right we wouldn't have to rejoin

422
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,280
if everything if the but if it was only

423
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,020
the jrc that died okay and the rest of

424
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,220
the plant was fine it was powered and

425
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:17,860
kept running it would just keep running

426
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,750
you just can't fake a ssin you are not

427
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,149
entirely correct on that because the

428
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,600
problem is the the parameter update

429
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:29,470
response that comes from the GRC so if

430
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,459
jrc loses the state yes if the jrc loses

431
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,530
the state it needs to right now the text

432
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,080
in the draft says okay you have to force

433
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:42,010
out of and all the 6lb ours to reboot

434
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,460
why because you know on the parameter

435
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,860
update request for example for eking or

436
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,590
something of course as we get to a Ricky

437
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,760
we're screwed and we have to rebuild the

438
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,260
network because we've lost all that

439
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,400
state I totally agree with you yes

440
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,320
you're absolutely right what I'm trying

441
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
to say is that during the period that

442
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,620
the jrc was being rebuilt

443
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,030
being reloaded okay

444
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,010
unless the network had to do something

445
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,110
involving the jrc it could keep

446
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,420
operating that's Korea but it can't go

447
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,429
forever right so at some point you say

448
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,270
okay Sunday morning oh you know what I

449
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,770
hope you can

450
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,900
there is no website and with the mail

451
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,000
Jets and stuff that's there is no red

452
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,370
button with emergency stop on that

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,940
scenario there isn't yeah you don't have

454
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,050
to do that yeah they're giving it of

455
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,610
course one of the things we'll probably

456
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,399
also happens that because the time book

457
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,399
the master time coordinating neighbor

458
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,780
goes away because it usually probably

459
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,180
the first you know connected to very

460
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,399
title the coordinator and when that time

461
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,290
connection connection goes away at some

462
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,670
point you probably you see but you'll

463
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,050
have them talk about anything neighbors

464
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,020
and then you don't trust anybody because

465
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,580
they you know then you don't have any

466
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,280
neighbors anymore and then you drop out

467
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,649
of network at the first node network and

468
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,670
all of his you know children drop out of

469
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:58,770
network and yeah this is the case if jrc

470
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,840
is co-located with the 6lb are but we

471
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,400
also support the case with jrc is in the

472
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:09,929
cloud for example and manages multiple

473
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:14,550
networks yeah okay yes so then we also

474
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:16,920
had the update 11 after Pascal's review

475
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:21,360
so it was mainly an editorial update

476
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:24,830
without update of references and a

477
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,139
couple of roots in Section six one two

478
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:31,740
regarding the setting of the diffserv

479
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:36,060
code points in couple of needs fixed

480
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:38,190
here and there so now I would like to

481
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,860
skip to the latest discussion on the

482
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,830
mailing list so we have essentially two

483
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,679
issues open but before I go into those

484
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,560
details I will give some background on I

485
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,510
Triple E 15 for that influences these

486
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,580
discussions so first one is the

487
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:57,660
construction of the layer two nuns in

488
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:01,560
802 15.4 T SCH and as you can see the

489
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:05,059
nonce is a 13 byte octet stream at 30

490
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:08,399
knock that byte stream

491
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:11,010
that contains the source address of the

492
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,809
of the pier sending that the frame and

493
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:18,300
the ASN the ASN is the absolute shot

494
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,490
number it's the local notion of time at

495
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,490
the device and this is implicitly put

496
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:27,570
into the decision procedure as the nonce

497
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,960
in order to to perform the security

498
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:33,929
procedures of the CCM security

499
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,460
procedures and then the source address

500
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:41,940
can be either be the eui-64 of the of

501
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,870
the sending pier or its short address in

502
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:48,030
which case it is derived as follows

503
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,580
essentially the first three octaves are

504
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:53,370
the company identifier a reserved zero

505
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,540
zero pan ID and the short address which

506
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,300
is of interest for us to bite locally

507
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:04,530
unique to byte address that is assigned

508
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:09,149
by the jrc to the to the to the to the

509
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:11,220
pledged at the drawing time so now this

510
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,870
this is decide is important in order to

511
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:18,120
understand when can the nonce three use

512
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:20,760
occur usually the DUI 64 is a globally

513
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,370
unique so when when the node is using

514
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,720
that in the layer two security

515
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:31,290
procedures there is no risk of this part

516
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,850
of the nonce being reused but then as we

517
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:36,809
can see lighted and in the attack that

518
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:40,649
Tara brought up the a the notion of a SN

519
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:45,420
is critical as if the ASN is the old

520
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:48,990
erase and is used essentially the the

521
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,140
nonce reuse can occur so to understand

522
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:56,400
the better how how the ASN is

523
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:59,480
distributed I gave here this slide with

524
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,510
essentially the pledge in scanning mode

525
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:06,030
try listening for beacons from from the

526
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:08,730
network and to advertising nodes that

527
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:12,620
send beacons at different instants so

528
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:16,560
the pledge according to RFC eighty

529
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:18,000
minimal 8480 no eighty one eighty eighty

530
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,169
one eighty

531
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,130
pledge waits for maxi be delay time to

532
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,360
find num numbers to wait neighbours

533
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,720
essentially two parameters that specify

534
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,629
how long should be the maximal scanning

535
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:39,210
time be if and how many neighbors should

536
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:41,220
at least the pledge listen to for and

537
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,430
upon the expiration of this time

538
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,520
essentially the pledge the pledge

539
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:53,040
selects one of these advertising nodes

540
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:56,370
as its joint proxy with the beacon

541
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,970
containing the ASN number with with

542
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:02,879
beacon containing the the information

543
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,430
element carrying the current ASN in the

544
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,920
network and now beacon is protected

545
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,560
cryptographically it's authenticated but

546
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,310
at this time here the pledge does not

547
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,620
have a means of verifying it and it does

548
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:19,379
a leap of faith and sense the drawing

549
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:23,729
requests and drawing response through

550
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:27,480
this drawing proxy but without layer two

551
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,700
security involved meaning that a SN and

552
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,710
that it heard from the beacon is only

553
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,640
used for communication purposes but not

554
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:38,940
for crypto purposes so now to explain

555
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,700
how the attack works we assume the

556
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,970
attacker is in bit place a man in the

557
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:49,830
middle between the draw and proxy and

558
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:52,890
end the pledge and it replays the replay

559
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:55,620
it stores it listens for some time and

560
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,890
stores the enhanced beacons that the

561
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,780
legitimate enhance beacons that were

562
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:04,050
exchanged in the network and replace

563
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,910
them at a later time to the pledge now

564
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,879
pledged without being able to validate

565
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:11,520
here the content in the enhanced beacon

566
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,770
it takes this notion of a SN and since

567
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,379
the drawing requested the corresponding

568
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:18,389
slots and the attacker forwards this

569
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,200
onwards through the legitimate network

570
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,970
to the Dre RC and the Dre RC sees this

571
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,280
is a fresh drawing request so it's a

572
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,830
legitimate pledge that has the keys

573
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,009
involve so everything is fine it will

574
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:34,879
respond with the drawing response

575
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:38,179
with the join response currently not

576
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:41,119
having any secure any layer to

577
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:43,129
protection on on this lag between the

578
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,309
join proxy and the pledge

579
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:48,859
so all until this point everything is

580
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:51,049
fine and even here when join response

581
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:54,199
risk is received we have text in the

582
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:56,960
draft that now states that this enhanced

583
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,889
beacon that was used to select the join

584
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,259
proxy should be stored in memory and

585
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:09,049
then validated once we have the

586
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:12,169
corresponding key so this attack still

587
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:15,889
works as if because the the enhance

588
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:18,350
beacon will validate as it's a regular

589
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:20,629
enhanced beacon from the network but it

590
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:23,029
will be a replay so the ASN will

591
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:25,100
essentially be lower than the one that

592
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:28,009
is currently going on in the legitimate

593
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,259
part of the network over on this side so

594
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:33,559
the problem arises now after the drawing

595
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:36,399
after the drawing process once the

596
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:39,799
drawing response is received in the

597
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,229
replayed enhanced beacon validates the

598
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:47,230
pledges notion of time will be this

599
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:50,059
number here 23 23 plus the time it that

600
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:53,029
elapsed to get to this point here so

601
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:55,249
let's say that's 55 so when the pledge

602
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:58,340
now uses the keys that it obtained from

603
00:30:55,249 --> 00:31:04,340
the drawing response it will use the ASN

604
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:07,459
55 in this derivation here that might

605
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,699
have been replayed before from a

606
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,649
previous attempt of joining the network

607
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,350
from a previous network exchange

608
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:18,408
essentially and which might lead to the

609
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:21,799
dis frame this to the nonce reuse at

610
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:24,889
layer 2 of this particular frame with a

611
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:27,379
s and 55 so essentially the nonce reuse

612
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:29,178
happens in two cases if if I'm

613
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:32,149
summarizing the mailing list discussions

614
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:35,509
correctly if the short cutter is given

615
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:38,539
to the pledge was reassigned so now the

616
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:42,679
pledge was given a short address that

617
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:44,629
was used with a sl55 before and if the

618
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,000
pledge

619
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,309
is joining for the end time and

620
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,389
essentially previously to send frames

621
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:58,970
secured under AAS and 55 so so here the

622
00:31:56,389 --> 00:32:01,639
proposed resolution is quite simple but

623
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,889
it involves some cross layer signaling

624
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:07,010
some some cross layer operations

625
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:10,939
essentially what we proposed we had a

626
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:14,690
side meeting involving meet arrow and we

627
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:17,210
also discussed with Pascal on on the

628
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,460
proposed resolution how we should

629
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,880
approach this problem and essentially it

630
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:25,760
involves authenticating at layer to the

631
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,340
join response on the lag between join

632
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,830
proxy and the pledge where previously

633
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:34,480
there was no security involved so this

634
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:38,120
is a bit tricky because join response

635
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,690
join proxy contain or already is part of

636
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,268
the network and it has the keys that are

637
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,539
used in the network so it can send this

638
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:51,679
frame authenticated but not encrypted

639
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:54,679
for for the pledge so essentially when

640
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,649
pledge does in the process is as follows

641
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,620
the pledge sensor drawing requests as

642
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:04,939
before without any layer to security the

643
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,620
join request goes to the jrc jrc

644
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,529
responds with the drawing response so

645
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,649
all of this logical connection here goes

646
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,779
over the network encrypted at layer two

647
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,370
so this is all fine but the trend comes

648
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,669
here so essentially when the join

649
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:23,029
response comes at to the to the join

650
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:26,809
proxy instead of sending it without any

651
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:30,200
layer two security join proxy sends this

652
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:33,139
with one of the first three security

653
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,139
levels in 802 dot 15.4 which involve

654
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:39,370
only authentication of the frame so now

655
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:42,199
this means that the pledge

656
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:45,500
receives a frame that has the security

657
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,230
level bit set but that it doesn't have

658
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,630
the key to verify the validity of this

659
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:54,169
frame because the key is inside this

660
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:57,290
frame so the procedure is as follows we

661
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:59,320
are essentially the pledge

662
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,940
discards the layer two Olympic

663
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,520
verification it decrypts and verifies

664
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:08,570
the end-to-end a security session of

665
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:11,119
Oscar from this co-op message and the

666
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,730
coding of the Seaboard object it gets

667
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,590
the layer two keys and now passes back

668
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,199
the whole thing into the layer two

669
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,109
machinery in order to validate the frame

670
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:24,799
to validate specifically D authenticity

671
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,929
at layer two of the frame that that that

672
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:33,109
it that it used to obtain the drawing

673
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:36,918
response so essentially the change is

674
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:40,040
only that the change on a high-level is

675
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:43,250
that this frame here instead of having

676
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,830
no layer to security now contain now is

677
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,290
secured using one of first three

678
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,330
security levels of I Triple E 15 for

679
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,060
involving authentication but not

680
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:58,970
encryption so there are a couple of

681
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:02,390
carrots with with this approach first

682
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:05,450
off it is a bit tricky in terms of the

683
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:11,259
implement implemented wise to process

684
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:15,049
this to process the frame that has the

685
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:17,720
security level bit set but the security

686
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,480
processing fails especially because this

687
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,509
frame is unicast so there is a special

688
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,470
mode in a to 2015 for called promiscuous

689
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:30,470
mode that allows the when set when this

690
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:35,990
attribute is set in 802 15 for all the

691
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:38,000
frames regardless of the of the state of

692
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,759
the security processing are passed to

693
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,170
the upper layer there oh so actually

694
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,180
promises motion passes

695
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,950
everything up to the higher level so

696
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,750
it's not if you call us what about is

697
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,600
you know if everything has persisted Mac

698
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,520
OS or the FCS is passed up so it's a

699
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,500
checksum that matches it's passed that

700
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,859
we can as if it's testing it to you or

701
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,880
not

702
00:35:54,859 --> 00:36:00,590
there is an other way which is currently

703
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,980
not possible but it would build the in

704
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:06,680
future hopefully next year is that when

705
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:11,120
we receive a frame that is we don't have

706
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:15,529
a keys we I Triple E in 54 says a big

707
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,970
all this MLM me does it say what Emily

708
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,810
call that this comma indicates and that

709
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,839
tells you that there was something

710
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:22,279
happening from the network and if we

711
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,990
have received the frame that we don't

712
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,300
have a key

713
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:28,910
currently that MLM recall doesn't

714
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,470
receive the frame there is no frame

715
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,879
there is no it nothing there it's just a

716
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,980
stat oh we appreciate the frame from

717
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,950
this person and we don't have a key for

718
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,910
it it's not the keys please

719
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,100
what we are planning to do in the

720
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,799
renovation we are doing 15 for revision

721
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,390
now we are planning to add the you know

722
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,890
information Terrace or the higher level

723
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:47,390
actually gets the key gets the whole

724
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,330
frame so that you can actually process

725
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:53,089
it there in that that be the teacher

726
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:55,490
hopefully this will be in 2020 version

727
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,580
of the 15-4 okay so to summarize

728
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,770
currently we have a way forward with the

729
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,020
promiscuous mode and in the 2020

730
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,420
revision there will be essentially a

731
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:11,030
cleaner way of doing the same thing

732
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:12,920
so let's come just if really you wanted

733
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,410
to avoid this weird back and forth

734
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,810
between the lower layer you could since

735
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,629
the turn response is really really she

736
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:23,120
ate it by the trade proxy trend proxy

737
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,730
could always place some fields in there

738
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:33,319
were signs the knobs at your corner here

739
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:35,690
I feel like just but so we don't have a

740
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,790
security association between the drawing

741
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,910
proxy and the pledge so this is the

742
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,920
problem so the only security association

743
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:46,009
of the drawing proxy and the pledge are

744
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:51,770
the layer two keys and this is exactly

745
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:53,690
what we are doing at layer two something

746
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,580
inside the packet is supposed to but it

747
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,720
works the way I did it but just wanted

748
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,310
to avoid the back and fast you could

749
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,790
have used there to keep saying something

750
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:09,020
a small option in the packet and and she

751
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:10,700
really want it to same thing right so

752
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,570
you are saying we could add something on

753
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,569
the end to end layer

754
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,790
I'm saying the giant proxy could have

755
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,589
that I didn't option inside a message

756
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,180
that could have formed itself with a Mac

757
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,500
which would be the equivalent of the Mac

758
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,690
that you get a tree or two using the

759
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,210
rear turkeys but that would not so you

760
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:39,420
could have done it at the quote encoder

761
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:41,130
power using this I mean this this would

762
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,440
be possible but for cryptographic

763
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,900
hygiene we would need to derive I mean

764
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,900
we would have to use different keys than

765
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:52,320
the one that is used that the at layer

766
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,750
two it's also a problem that we want to

767
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,840
we want to tie this out of the case and

768
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,720
the layer to ASM and the problem with

769
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,390
ASM is that when the you're turning

770
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,759
proxy or Tony knows it's ended the frame

771
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:08,700
they have no idea what the SNS called to

772
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,380
be because I mean what they put the

773
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,160
things create the frame they send it out

774
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,140
the back layer takes the frame waits for

775
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,290
the minute suitable channel you know the

776
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,210
time spot to be and okay see

777
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,370
oh it's busy I go to the next one oh

778
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,680
that's empty okay now I send it out and

779
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:28,259
then if the ASN is going to be that what

780
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,720
is gonna be used for a prior there's no

781
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,060
way of it now in Tunisia yeah so even

782
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,919
though it's a single hop away it's the

783
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:42,000
upper layer so I concur with Tara yeah

784
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:46,140
yeah yeah so this is one so the use of

785
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:51,030
promiscuous mode and the and the update

786
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:52,799
for plan for 2020 revision of 15.4 will

787
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,320
make this essentially possible in terms

788
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:00,600
of security processing another carry it

789
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:03,890
is is related to the layer to AK of the

790
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,630
join response and the join response

791
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:09,420
since the drawing response frame as you

792
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:12,600
can see here it is now sent with the

793
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,360
security level one two three so

794
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:19,170
authentication but no encryption from at

795
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,720
the join proxy so at the pledge side it

796
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:24,330
does the special processing that we do I

797
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,879
just presented here but the problem is

798
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:29,190
that when now since this is a unicast

799
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,540
frame the pledge needs to send an

800
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,090
acknowledgment a layer two

801
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:37,080
acknowledgment that normally in TS CH is

802
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:40,060
detected as well using the same level of

803
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,759
security that was used for the incoming

804
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:45,400
frame and the problem here is that there

805
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,980
is no enough time to do the whole to do

806
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,930
the whole upper layer processing and

807
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,490
before sending that layer to an

808
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:56,259
acknowledgment so the the enhanced

809
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:59,259
acknowledgment that is sent back here is

810
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:01,750
own can only be sent in without any

811
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,970
layer to security and this still works

812
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:07,180
with the current configuration in the

813
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:10,620
draft because the drawing proxy has this

814
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:14,319
SEC exempt attribute set for this pledge

815
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:16,750
that allows essentially the the frames

816
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,110
that are unsecured to pass to be passed

817
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:23,140
to the upper layer so life in question

818
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,730
so say this one in the world right what

819
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,040
would happen probably the join proxy

820
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,350
would retry the joint response and then

821
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,360
it would work right so essentially if

822
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:40,810
this wouldn't work drawing proxy would

823
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:46,690
retransmit yes yes yes that's a good

824
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:49,330
point because even if you know even if

825
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,660
you don't be able to do this kind of

826
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,950
crypto methods we can be retained or we

827
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,490
can actually sustain that you know the

828
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,890
responder type bridge the state spraying

829
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:02,620
ignores that that it failed the risk

830
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:05,020
security takes the OS core there and put

831
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,940
the keys in and waits for the trust and

832
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,770
many hints of retransmission then he

833
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,420
knows that okay he can verify that the

834
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,820
retransmission conduct is saying that

835
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,710
previous that he is check out that it

836
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,600
same because otherwise he doesn't know

837
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,120
its a hardcore you know actually he does

838
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,710
that anyway because he does not read it

839
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,690
just see the course name and then he

840
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,280
acts it I show you like the properties

841
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,720
of that because now is sure that

842
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:34,720
everything is that otherwise he's

843
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:36,700
guessing okay so and the last couple of

844
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,250
slides so there was one additional

845
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,879
thread that error started on the on the

846
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,880
mailing list

847
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,850
regarding the CCM security proofs and it

848
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,069
turns out that the CCM star security

849
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:51,670
proofs do not apply to the TS

850
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:56,259
chmod of 802 54 so what I'm discussing

851
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:58,749
here is a generic 802 15 4 situation not

852
00:42:56,259 --> 00:43:01,749
specific to 6 dish but since we are

853
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:04,299
using the TS chmod obviously it relates

854
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:07,448
to us or we can put some text in the

855
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:09,699
minimum security draft so to come back

856
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:13,199
so essentially CCM star security proofs

857
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:17,170
do not apply to the TSE h because they

858
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:20,229
assumed that they required that the

859
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:22,920
norms contains the security level which

860
00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:28,118
is the case with regular 15 4 but not

861
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:30,459
1540 SCH so with this we revert back

862
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,269
essentially to the you I mean we we can

863
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:37,118
still rely on the proofs of CCM CCM but

864
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:39,038
the limitation there it is that a single

865
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,029
key can only be used with fixed line

866
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:45,819
length authentication tags meaning that

867
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:51,339
we need to prohibit the mixing of

868
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:56,140
different security levels in the network

869
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:59,019
where different pairs of nodes use

870
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,549
different length of the authentication

871
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:05,499
tag or message integrity chromic as in

872
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:09,190
in with the same key obviously with the

873
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:11,288
same key so the I mean this what what we

874
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,739
propose to be added in the draft is just

875
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:19,209
a small paragraph in the in this section

876
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:21,609
on I Triple E 1540s forbidding 4 by a

877
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:25,538
forbidding the use of different security

878
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:27,670
levels with the same thing so that's

879
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:31,269
pretty much it I don't know if I think

880
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,949
I'm good on time so the conclusion is so

881
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,629
these were the latest discussion that

882
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:37,920
were triggered essentially after the

883
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:41,799
review of the architecture draft that

884
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,079
that that inspired this discussion so

885
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:48,609
it's good the document is shipped

886
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:51,069
already to the ad so I think I'm not

887
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:55,140
sure now whether we should wait for the

888
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:55,140
reviews or do these changes immediately

889
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,259
I make the change immediately because I

890
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:04,299
haven't read it yet so okay let's do it

891
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:07,660
now and so I can just read the latest

892
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,700
read it on my editor view pilots fourth

893
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,799
on the pile so I'll just like get to it

894
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,930
probably next week or just week after

895
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,670
that okay this person is do it like okay

896
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,828
whenever you can so we have the

897
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,630
resolutions it seems there are no

898
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:22,089
objections to the resolution so I think

899
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:27,819
it's just the matter of editorial text

900
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:29,529
adding text to the draft okay yeah so

901
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:31,720
that would be all thanks thank you many

902
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:36,490
show and actually we have five minutes

903
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:50,200
in advance and the next I guess is my

904
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:52,990
college fine my no reserves yes it is

905
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,270
you but we only have your slide spawn

906
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:58,209
and speakin the first topic was zero

907
00:45:55,270 --> 00:46:00,730
touch so she want to give us news on the

908
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,640
vouchers I don't think I sent slides

909
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:07,420
because I didn't think there was news so

910
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:11,410
0 touch yes I have posted a new revision

911
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,990
of the document it is significantly

912
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:18,399
shorter it had expired I believe

913
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:20,950
sometime last summer and it is

914
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,040
significantly shorter because the goal

915
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:26,609
is always to have the work done

916
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:30,640
elsewhere and that work is getting done

917
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:34,930
so specifically you may be aware that

918
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:40,540
the base zero touch brewski document is

919
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:42,640
at the is G and a lot of discusses

920
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:47,380
hopefully they'll get cleared in the

921
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:50,170
next week and that will go forward the

922
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:53,829
0dt security zero touch join document

923
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:54,640
depends upon Animas constrained voucher

924
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:57,310
and constrained

925
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:04,089
brueski document which is a remodeling

926
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:08,950
of brewski to ed Hawk plus Cosi signed

927
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:11,490
Seaboard vouchers and what's the other

928
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,490
part

929
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:17,890
let's go up yes OS core and co-op okay

930
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,599
and so that's what this document says

931
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:22,058
and so I essentially reduced it there

932
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,520
I've actually removed DTLS from this

933
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:29,200
document if you don't like that we could

934
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:31,839
discuss that point and it I've removed

935
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,308
many pieces that have since moved into

936
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,599
minimal security so that's why it got

937
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,950
much smaller and that was always the

938
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:38,859
goal the document that was always

939
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:41,020
supposed to say do ABCD they're over

940
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:43,109
here and not document themselves so

941
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,180
that's what that well that's where that

942
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:47,529
went

943
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,440
but there's no substantive dot changes

944
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:53,140
to the protocol or the concepts just the

945
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,920
text is no longer redundant that makes

946
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,540
sense to you pascal does no I'm just

947
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,000
wondering what the future is for these

948
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:05,740
documents because future the future is

949
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,880
that that the priority for me is to get

950
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:14,529
the documents that this one depends upon

951
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:18,309
through we had AB off on Monday called

952
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:20,410
lake and if that goes forward which I

953
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:22,210
believe it will then we will have IDI

954
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,540
hawk which allows us to do zero touch

955
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:28,059
without DTLS otherwise we're how do we

956
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,859
fit monster DTLS packets over and it

957
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:32,200
doesn't involve it doesn't interoperate

958
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:35,950
very nicely with minimal security or OS

959
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,720
core and if that's the only option then

960
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,509
the answer is we probably don't have

961
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:43,598
anything to advanced but if we have IDI

962
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:46,839
hawk or something equivalent in the lake

963
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,490
working group or Boff then that's good

964
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,690
so essentially that's waiting for that

965
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,750
piece and it's been waiting for that

966
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:56,020
piece for what three years now right so

967
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,880
that's where that is because as we said

968
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,250
only in the in the group right the group

969
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,819
has two options is to which other just

970
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,380
for the scheduling or to just disband

971
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:07,299
and call victory if we do the latter

972
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,000
then this will probably be the only

973
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:11,980
outstanding draft that the would well

974
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,190
group would have when we quote-unquote

975
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:17,650
shut down so we would have to see how we

976
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:20,079
we keep some lights on so you can finish

977
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:24,010
the work that's a good point thank you

978
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,280
actually and some of us I think you

979
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:30,100
included are going to have a chat with

980
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:32,350
Ignace who is an 84 anima as to how do

981
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,970
we do how do we regroup some of these

982
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,220
documents together into the right place

983
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,839
and and maybe Suresh you'd like to join

984
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,299
us it's where we're gonna meet right

985
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,920
here right after this meeting if you

986
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,020
have ten minutes afterwards that point

987
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,540
so we'll probably be IP if this is

988
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:49,000
transferred somewhere so that would that

989
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,350
would please me just fine the contents

990
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,700
of this document are not particularly

991
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,830
six tissue-specific

992
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,029
anymore and this essentially all of the

993
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:58,210
things that are except for the

994
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,740
constraints of the solution all of the

995
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,140
things that worse but six dishes

996
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:04,299
specific in this document sometime ago

997
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,009
have moved to the minimal security

998
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,290
document and that's exactly what the

999
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:14,020
goal was was to get get it out of

1000
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:17,920
something and do that so any question on

1001
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:19,120
this in the room I didn't do any slides

1002
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,080
I'm sorry I just didn't think there was

1003
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:26,230
anything to tell you

1004
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:27,370
I guess there is the other button the

1005
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,940
big button yeah there we go

1006
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:37,210
this is the shelter item well to deliver

1007
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:39,250
go I did to enhance beacon okay so

1008
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:42,340
what's the problem what is proposed what

1009
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:45,220
we're doing a problem from some time ago

1010
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,620
is you have a new device and they would

1011
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,350
like to do a couple things first of all

1012
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,120
they would like to find the network um

1013
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:54,430
they get beacons to do that they would

1014
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:58,299
like to know if they have found the

1015
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:59,980
correct network or rather if they have

1016
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,900
find the diversity of networks that they

1017
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,100
wish to find and they get beacons from

1018
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,880
different places and they don't really

1019
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:10,960
know where they belong in in the the co

1020
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,150
chip joint process that six dish minimal

1021
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,970
describes and DT security depends upon

1022
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:17,920
as well you are supposed to go through

1023
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:20,740
all the joint proxies for given network

1024
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,330
and try them all out so it's important

1025
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,830
to know which one proxies belong to the

1026
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,600
green networks and which runs brawlin so

1027
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,790
the blue network so that you can either

1028
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,770
try also you can try the green network

1029
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,210
and a blue network and then a green

1030
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,440
network and then a blue network and one

1031
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,210
of them might like you in one of them I

1032
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,460
not if you waste all your time on the

1033
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:37,780
network that doesn't that isn't going to

1034
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,760
accept you then

1035
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,410
that's a bad thing so that's those that

1036
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,750
there's a couple of different things the

1037
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:45,879
second thing that people asked is well I

1038
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:48,070
would like to have some information

1039
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,510
about the networks that are there so

1040
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:53,290
that I can join the network which either

1041
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:54,940
is less loaded or the parts of the

1042
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,590
network which are less loaded so you may

1043
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,540
have several choices in the blue network

1044
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:01,210
as you see as two different places you

1045
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,860
could join and that would determine

1046
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,380
what's going on so the question is can

1047
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:09,190
you get this information before you have

1048
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:12,310
done all the stuff in particularly this

1049
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:14,820
not just applies to the join step the

1050
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:16,960
enrollment step but it also applies to

1051
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,730
Sleepy nodes that may have slept too

1052
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,220
long too and gotten out of sync on their

1053
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:23,170
ASNs and therefore need to join have the

1054
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,399
keys but they need to then figure out

1055
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:28,360
which part of the network they need to

1056
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,970
join and do the right thing so six dish

1057
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,290
part we've created an information

1058
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:35,049
element which goes in the enhanced

1059
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:36,730
beacon that uses the IETF allocation

1060
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:41,010
that Te'o given in got us from the I

1061
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:44,470
Triple E in RFC eighty 137 and gives us

1062
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:46,180
a bunch of things in there that are ID

1063
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:49,270
to tell you network ID to tell you which

1064
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:52,060
network is which if you like you get the

1065
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:53,110
lower 64 bit so the join proxy so that

1066
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,049
you don't have to do a neighbor

1067
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:59,110
discovery a multicast Neera discovery to

1068
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:02,860
find it assuming that the lower bits are

1069
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:05,710
not the same as the in the l2 address of

1070
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,420
the beacon that you heard and then you

1071
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:09,550
get some other numbers ranked priority

1072
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:12,460
priority priority and these are

1073
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,590
containers for things so the rank

1074
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,890
priority

1075
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:20,440
[Music]

1076
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:21,730
I remember how right comes from ripple

1077
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,410
and there's a document a ripple that

1078
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,930
tells you how you might like to fill

1079
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:28,089
that in not this working groups bother

1080
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:30,460
just it's a container to put something

1081
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:33,520
in the our flag tells you whether or not

1082
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:35,440
the router would accept is a factory

1083
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,090
router and would accept unicast router

1084
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,320
solicitations which you might like to do

1085
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,660
because that again saves another

1086
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,860
broadcast so that's really it there

1087
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,390
hasn't been a lot of movement we've

1088
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,490
changed the format of this added and

1089
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,720
removed some things over the last year

1090
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:49,029
and a half or two years since it's been

1091
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,319
alive and that's really yet we think

1092
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,040
it's ready for working group last call

1093
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:56,830
there's

1094
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:58,210
a lot else to do oh and we need this

1095
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:01,870
because otherwise you can't find the

1096
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:03,310
joint proxy but I think I did the ship

1097
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,900
at right here all right listen you did

1098
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:09,790
do that and I think I took all of your

1099
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:12,250
comments and they're in right I've

1100
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:14,020
placed an aggressive date for submitting

1101
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,970
to ASG because one it's a simple thing

1102
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:20,020
and second well done and very very very

1103
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:22,689
very stable so I expect that you know I

1104
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,670
think we did the vocalist called I'm

1105
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:26,890
surprised well no you have dinner

1106
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,420
waiting goob last call okay no no I keep

1107
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,890
asking do you want to do working group

1108
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,890
last call and you keep saying yes but

1109
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,860
okay so maybe I have some comments to

1110
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:46,330
process I will double-check about that

1111
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:47,890
but they will certainly get we'll both

1112
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:50,860
check and see if we checked on the

1113
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:52,900
checking and then to check that that but

1114
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,450
they point is that none of his comments

1115
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,710
were were were substantive about

1116
00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:04,120
changing bits on the wire or anything

1117
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:08,020
like that there were like any question

1118
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:18,390
in the room as a non coffee drinker I've

1119
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:18,390
had too much coffee we'll invite yes I

1120
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:23,590
message so thank you thank you very much

1121
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,600
so so basically we had the choice of

1122
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:28,780
taking of inviting one of the main

1123
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,110
authors but from Terry so well you know

1124
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:35,230
music oh but Josh was with us he knows

1125
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:36,640
the spec very very very well and so we

1126
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:40,810
asked him to do the presentation of

1127
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,520
behalf of the remotes editors so thank

1128
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,350
you yeah Chuck actually accepting to

1129
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:48,670
give us the status the slides were done

1130
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:52,810
by thankfully yes yeah hi danke I'm

1131
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:54,910
presenting MSA up late so there are

1132
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,170
three divisions the burdens of the MSA

1133
00:55:54,910 --> 00:56:00,310
trough scenes

1134
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:04,369
last ITF meetings and the main changes

1135
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:07,279
or t3 but a major

1136
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:11,599
things that first to the user of the

1137
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:14,900
author myself and our traffic things the

1138
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,779
first three I'm explaining about autumn

1139
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:21,589
are cells so the in the previous that

1140
00:56:17,779 --> 00:56:24,950
bested the Virgin tree we had old up

1141
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:28,099
cells and down cells and upsell is

1142
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:31,640
basically used for the upward traffic to

1143
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:34,039
chose to do the parent and all down

1144
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:39,469
cells is most of used for downward

1145
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:41,989
traffic to your children so that specs

1146
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:45,759
has been changed change that actually

1147
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:49,999
the removed and we have now the two new

1148
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:53,380
Ottomans tire the cell types one is auto

1149
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:57,709
TX cells and the other is auto or Excel

1150
00:56:53,380 --> 00:57:02,809
so basically them node the schedule old

1151
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:06,049
or Excel the its slot offset in the

1152
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:10,479
China offset or calculate based on its

1153
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:13,430
you are the MAC address and when you

1154
00:57:10,479 --> 00:57:16,700
have the frame to your neighbor and you

1155
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:19,788
don't have any delicate cell to the

1156
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:24,649
neighbor you schedule the auto txl on

1157
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:27,769
the map to send out the frame so the

1158
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:30,619
sort offset an eternal offset for the

1159
00:57:27,769 --> 00:57:33,459
auto t XL is again the calculate based

1160
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:36,829
on the debt neighbors the MAC address

1161
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:39,469
once you for example you don't have any

1162
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:43,670
frame to transmit to the the neighbor in

1163
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:46,789
your text hxq you can the remove

1164
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:49,099
autotext cell so autotext cell is

1165
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:53,509
expected expected to be removed

1166
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:57,339
automatically so that that's why we on

1167
00:57:53,509 --> 00:58:01,849
demand on the schedule so these figures

1168
00:57:57,339 --> 00:58:05,538
show the difference between auto down

1169
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:09,859
cell upsell and auto texas and auto or

1170
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:15,170
sell their ideas so when you look at the

1171
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:19,009
node of be in the version three the auto

1172
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:23,979
be has to ottoman cells one is auto

1173
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:28,400
absent and down cell now

1174
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:32,660
nodoby has one art self auto or excel

1175
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:38,619
and it has three auto txl that is for

1176
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:43,479
its neighbors another major changes

1177
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:49,190
change is dedicate ourselves to parent

1178
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:52,160
so before the MSF defines the note just

1179
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:54,769
after joining the network the node

1180
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,009
schedule the data cos T Excel to the

1181
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:01,848
parent that in the end of states of the

1182
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:05,539
journey process but now the the node

1183
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:10,880
schedule dedicate arcs as well with a

1184
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:15,190
parent for for incoming traffic so this

1185
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:20,210
is another the major thing it's it's

1186
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:24,019
it's a relatively new idea so I think

1187
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:27,460
the authors expect the more feeder box

1188
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:32,868
on this feature because it's new

1189
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:36,130
another thing is it just the sorry the

1190
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:40,099
the comments which are already resolved

1191
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:43,519
so and also you can find the details in

1192
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:47,630
marrying these archives so there are two

1193
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:50,808
things remain so to be discussed one is

1194
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:53,150
a the cell this about service

1195
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:57,619
this is passed all the suggestions to

1196
00:59:53,150 --> 01:00:00,979
how to how to select the cell to propose

1197
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:05,779
in a other requests so the Pascal

1198
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:11,718
suggests it is better to avoid the busy

1199
01:00:05,779 --> 01:00:16,039
cell to put to the cell list service to

1200
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:21,849
do that so doo-doo-doo-doo-doo deceiver

1201
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:21,849
oh you hear oh yeah please

1202
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:33,729
so first kill here yes so it really

1203
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,500
depends on on the kind of network you

1204
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:37,780
want to be out some of those networks

1205
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,910
has many many tags which are not

1206
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,920
synchronized with another in which case

1207
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:44,170
the normal CCA that is mandated by the

1208
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,230
Mac will work if there is somebody that

1209
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:49,720
transmits it starts a synchronously it

1210
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:52,900
will be detected though if you build a

1211
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:56,379
very large mesh and we do build very

1212
01:00:52,900 --> 01:01:00,040
large spacious like thousands of nodes

1213
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:01,990
and they are all synchronized then there

1214
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,140
is a good chance that there is somebody

1215
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:07,479
in your interference domain that may be

1216
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:10,029
doing MSF as you're doing it and that

1217
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:13,619
would pick yourself just randomly as you

1218
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:16,420
do and that you would be the same and

1219
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:18,609
argue that in that case it's better

1220
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:20,349
before you locate that cell that you

1221
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:22,680
listen a little bit in advance to that

1222
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:25,270
cell in the previous you know iteration

1223
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,558
using the nominal shear process but you

1224
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:28,900
just do this you see a window you don't

1225
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:32,980
transmit anything and you just assert

1226
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:35,230
that this friend seems not used which we

1227
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:38,170
can call a proactive validation of the

1228
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:39,790
cell what we have today is a reactive

1229
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:42,940
validation of the cell meaning that if

1230
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:45,339
we observe that one cell is not as

1231
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:47,280
efficient as the others meaning there is

1232
01:01:45,339 --> 01:01:50,308
more collision that cell than others

1233
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,410
then it's probably getting some

1234
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:55,150
collisions now it really depends on the

1235
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:57,250
kind of traffic you may you may get away

1236
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:59,579
cell you use it a little bit more a

1237
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:03,190
little bit less so I argue that the

1238
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:06,579
efficiency of the reactive discovery is

1239
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:08,650
very difficult to chew properly it could

1240
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:12,280
take time before you actually discover

1241
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:13,990
it's not okay and so I think that

1242
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,670
listening little bit to the cells before

1243
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:18,640
you actually allocate them maybe it's

1244
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:21,220
enough you turn it on or off but argue

1245
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:25,029
that it's unusual your useful thing to

1246
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:27,279
do it's being polite right like it's a

1247
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:30,359
little talk but it's the TCH way of

1248
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,359
doing listen before talk

1249
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:37,180
tarek unit it's just trying to think

1250
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:40,359
about how to actually do that if you

1251
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:42,009
think about the 15 for you know MLM e

1252
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,870
things because I don't think there's a

1253
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:45,550
way to do that you cut the other link

1254
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,920
yeah you sure you can say that up I'm

1255
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:49,930
called risking this but then you only

1256
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,540
listen the frames of our listeners to

1257
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:54,100
you and I don't know if I remember is

1258
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:56,560
there anything that allows you to this

1259
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:59,950
kind of promiscuous listening on one

1260
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,990
specific link on the channel it's I

1261
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:04,000
don't know if there other option of

1262
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:07,390
course is to do you know to send one

1263
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,340
broadcast frame to that link because one

1264
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:11,589
of the things is that if there's anybody

1265
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,390
using that link there's somebody

1266
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,250
listening that way and he's listening it

1267
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,500
all the time and if you send any kind of

1268
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:19,540
broadcast frame on that link he will act

1269
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:22,660
it he will send an acknowledgement back

1270
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:24,120
to you if you receive an ACK you know

1271
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,710
that there's somebody using that frame

1272
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,870
because somebody was listening it and he

1273
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,490
act your frame and he acted because he

1274
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:32,080
first broadcast rained it might be any

1275
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,950
different because completely empty

1276
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,140
because you don't need to have any

1277
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:40,629
content he will just add layer to

1278
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:41,980
acknowledgement they would have been

1279
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:45,150
sending at the same time yes you

1280
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:47,800
couldn't do that so take it as a

1281
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:50,050
requirement from us that if we agree

1282
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,400
that we would like to do CCA on cells

1283
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,410
before you use them it means that

1284
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,320
probably we are asking you to do

1285
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:58,450
something new at email me to give us the

1286
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:04,600
access to to the passive listening of

1287
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:06,580
the cell before we use it the problem

1288
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:11,589
really is that I don't know what do you

1289
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:14,920
want th-th things in MLM a are quite

1290
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:17,560
vague they are you know very high level

1291
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,710
where it is kind of wavy they don't

1292
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,850
really describe that much of the

1293
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:24,700
processing so that's why it's actually

1294
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:26,529
it's a little bit hard to say if you can

1295
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:34,359
actually use this on the CCA procedure

1296
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:35,830
is there so I bikinis exactly but you do

1297
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,450
it on the cell that you won't want to

1298
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,210
use and then you don't transmit anything

1299
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,919
yeah but I mean but as I said the CCA

1300
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,870
doesn't tell you that if there's anybody

1301
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,450
using that same track if he's interested

1302
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:49,328
you well it will detect

1303
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:52,899
energy in the air right no but what the

1304
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:56,560
CDC has done before the CCA is done

1305
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:59,349
before the frame is sent yes even if he

1306
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,060
is using the frame of thought so I don't

1307
01:04:59,349 --> 01:05:01,720
want to send the frame I want to do CCA

1308
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,680
what do I do

1309
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:08,828
so you would be needed to be CCA out of

1310
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:10,779
out-of-sync of the normal schedule

1311
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:12,700
because normally or what you do you have

1312
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:15,280
a slot starting late for a certain

1313
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,500
amount of time then you - CCA then you

1314
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,270
finish the CCA and then you wait a

1315
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,460
little bit more and then you'll start

1316
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:23,619
transplant so sale at the problem there

1317
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,079
is that the CCA is done in a way in a

1318
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:28,390
sense or in the location where nobody

1319
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,760
internet for questions with you is ever

1320
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,920
going to be sending anything and it's

1321
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,420
least if you want to do the CCA you

1322
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,780
would need to be doing that CCA and

1323
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:40,180
associated return to it which is a

1324
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,349
little bit more difficult I was thinking

1325
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,819
about more or less it would be something

1326
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:44,770
that you could actually make a link and

1327
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,750
say that I want to make this link as a

1328
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:48,880
promise cross lake meaning I won't

1329
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:50,980
receive me whatever somebody's sending

1330
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,720
on that link even if not tested it to me

1331
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,069
I just want to know that if there's

1332
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,109
something on that that would probably

1333
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:57,819
want way to doing that so we've read one

1334
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:59,348
more bit they're saying that we have an

1335
01:05:57,819 --> 01:06:01,029
error X that we have T X that we have

1336
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:02,500
shared we will something we'll have a

1337
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,510
say or thesis promise because I want to

1338
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,550
get anything on that link that tenders

1339
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:07,869
to be on the air at that link at the

1340
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,609
obviously isn't that that would probably

1341
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:11,050
be solving their problem if I think

1342
01:06:09,609 --> 01:06:13,119
about so let's take that to the

1343
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,680
meaningless but I see a need for

1344
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:20,970
something like that I don't know how to

1345
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:20,970
do it I trust you can help us I think we

1346
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:32,500
hear me yes we can

1347
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:35,579
yeah I'll risk the hand but actually

1348
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:39,099
what I wanna say it's kind of a water

1349
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:42,400
Tara wants a it's about the CCA actually

1350
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:45,579
didn't detect the frames if we really

1351
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:49,329
want to like listening to talk we have

1352
01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:54,369
to make the cell like your Excel first

1353
01:06:49,329 --> 01:06:57,730
and then on the TX l like it's a reserve

1354
01:06:54,369 --> 01:07:00,080
@ TX out but we can even listening at

1355
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:04,220
our Excel first for a while and we

1356
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:07,910
it detects anything and then we uses txl

1357
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:10,069
is it just sounds little I don't know

1358
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:15,049
whether this is stand compliant word or

1359
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:22,490
any it does sound a little strange for

1360
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:24,440
me yeah that's what I say well I hope

1361
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,700
that technique you could capture that

1362
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:30,460
because I did not understand everything

1363
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:34,240
I mean I mean the CCA

1364
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:37,100
because this is a perform for the TX

1365
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,200
offset right yes I mean tell explain

1366
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:42,560
that we understood I guessed at that

1367
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,810
point yeah what I'm saying is if we

1368
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:49,670
wanted to do something like listening

1369
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:52,700
this poor talk we have to like treat

1370
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:55,250
this DXL as a or excel first and listen

1371
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:59,060
for a while to check whether there's a

1372
01:07:55,250 --> 01:08:02,000
frame in the air and then if there's

1373
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:04,310
like after a while there's no frame in

1374
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,790
the air and then use the cell as TX

1375
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:09,110
later yes I mean let's continue that are

1376
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:11,210
meaningless to make sure everybody

1377
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:12,320
understands everybody because we we are

1378
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:17,000
running out of time for this

1379
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:19,279
slaughtering oh yes

1380
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,460
thankfully ideally you would go to the

1381
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:26,210
etherpad right you're on line with it

1382
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:28,149
can you just yeah okay I'm trying now as

1383
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:38,300
my phone yeah I would do that

1384
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:40,969
perfect thanks so much okay and also so

1385
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,940
thank a and measuring it Thomas had the

1386
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:46,550
offline discussion about the negotiated

1387
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:51,108
or accept the dedicated access to you

1388
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:54,020
with your parrot so again the the

1389
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:59,620
negotiator or Excel that idea itself is

1390
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:06,410
a new so and the many comments are

1391
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:10,010
expected it on a merriest so yeah and

1392
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:13,500
also there's no information but the MSF

1393
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:15,810
is implemented in an open dementia

1394
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:19,200
of course and the six is scimitar and

1395
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:21,720
now we have the MSM implementation for

1396
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,809
the kinetic energy so tech fair and I

1397
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:28,380
are planning to have the local interrupt

1398
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:31,650
the test based on the latest rough to

1399
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:34,140
make sure the spec is ready thank you

1400
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:37,170
know at some point in one of the slides

1401
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:39,779
that were like two items that still

1402
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:42,330
needed discussion we really would like

1403
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:44,069
to get these to work replace go so can

1404
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:48,960
we move on with those two discussion

1405
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:52,470
items to be discussed rules for the cell

1406
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,450
list and are not traffic adaptation guys

1407
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:56,370
if you could raise this question to the

1408
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:58,490
mailing list and explain exactly what

1409
01:09:56,370 --> 01:10:01,470
they are and make sure we discuss them

1410
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:04,650
so because the goal is to work with

1411
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:07,890
let's call this this year right so

1412
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:09,809
somewhere info to get there we need to

1413
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:11,630
get those two Ayesha resolved and so

1414
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:16,100
please bring them to the mailing list

1415
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:24,000
and then we'll do well go presscon okay

1416
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:26,280
thanks I totally agree nice ok so this

1417
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,180
we move on to the next and that's Marco

1418
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:32,490
did Michael yeah so thank you for

1419
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:35,120
rushing to US markets very nice thank

1420
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,120
you for bashing

1421
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:55,429
this is the Robert scheduling it's part

1422
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:57,710
of also the scheduling discussion

1423
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:59,120
like I said depend on the future of this

1424
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:07,100
working group whether we can take it

1425
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:21,920
somewhere or not right okay there is a

1426
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:28,280
button on it maybe the battery's gone hi

1427
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:30,680
this is Marco from rice and an update an

1428
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:35,179
updated this room is kind of being deaf

1429
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:37,400
now version 2 quick recap the document

1430
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:40,520
describes both an attack and the

1431
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:42,170
solution the attack is possible for an

1432
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,969
external adversaries even in the

1433
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,530
presence of security and the league

1434
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:47,960
failure can be performed very

1435
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:49,580
efficiently in a stealthy way low power

1436
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,600
consumption so even if you are on

1437
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,199
battery

1438
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:56,210
it's about essentially inferring 100

1439
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:58,940
percent precision the the full schedule

1440
01:11:56,210 --> 01:12:00,080
or not and then selecting which I'm with

1441
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,940
a hundred percent accuracy and

1442
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,820
effectiveness every single transmission

1443
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:07,280
and reception of that note the document

1444
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,769
proposal is also a solution that doesn't

1445
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,610
require any additional communication

1446
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:15,650
among the network nodes it's all about

1447
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:19,040
local efficient computation for

1448
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:22,009
shuffling cells at each slot frame in a

1449
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,830
synchronized way among network nodes so

1450
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:26,719
as a result you have schedule distill

1451
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:29,540
collision-free a consistent for all

1452
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,370
network nodes plus is now also

1453
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:35,530
unpredictable for an external adversary

1454
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:38,360
so essentially the attack is neutralized

1455
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:40,940
what happened after Prague we got

1456
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,589
reviews on the list and promised Pascal

1457
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,559
thenthe Michael thanks very much for

1458
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:47,900
that and then we got digital comments on

1459
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,650
a particular point arrays later from

1460
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:53,309
Michael Emma on the list again

1461
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:55,799
as a summary of updates we mostly as

1462
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:59,890
they refused I made a number of

1463
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:02,110
improvements in the document a quick

1464
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,510
overview about this thing Fayed one

1465
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:07,330
comments on clarifying the meaning of a

1466
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:09,370
symbol in the question done Michael

1467
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:11,019
wanted already additional motivations

1468
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:12,940
that we had in the introduction of why

1469
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:14,770
these attacks makes particular sense for

1470
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:18,910
instance in order to have no competitors

1471
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:25,150
network without being detected or hung

1472
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:27,160
yourself we also fixed the presentation

1473
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:29,170
of the actual shuffling mechanism used

1474
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,750
to produce the robust scheduling to be

1475
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:33,790
fully aligned with the later with latest

1476
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:36,040
fisheries version so to shuffle an

1477
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:38,560
element's you don't really need and

1478
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:41,230
swaps you need n minus one so it's even

1479
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:44,740
a little bit more efficient and it makes

1480
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:46,860
the related counter growth even thank

1481
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,860
you

1482
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:53,290
militia also recommended to relax a

1483
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:55,210
little bit a recommendation we were

1484
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:57,580
having in the previous version when we

1485
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:59,650
were saying well it's just recommended

1486
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:03,730
to shuffle not only channel offsets but

1487
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:06,400
also time offsets since in some use case

1488
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:08,049
or networks can make sense to just not

1489
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,400
do that for the sake of a network

1490
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:11,920
performance especially in the multi-hop

1491
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:13,500
context we remove the recommendation so

1492
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,880
we are just now describing the two

1493
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:19,300
possible shuffling and describe it the

1494
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:22,180
pros and cons of not doing or doing time

1495
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:24,580
shuffling then the biggest update came

1496
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:28,810
actually out of a comment from Michael I

1497
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:30,250
wanted to have some example outputs from

1498
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:33,400
essentially proof of concept

1499
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:35,170
implementation showing the produced out

1500
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,240
their schedules and schedules out of the

1501
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:40,030
original one so I made a proof of

1502
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:42,219
concept implementation using the OpenSSL

1503
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:44,880
primitives and you have an appendix now

1504
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:48,430
in the document with a full example

1505
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,950
performed by a network node four tiers

1506
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:54,010
load frames in the row with full details

1507
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:56,019
on the configuration that node on the

1508
01:14:54,010 --> 01:15:00,430
network the original schedule and now it

1509
01:14:56,020 --> 01:15:02,230
becomes cool thank you I haven't read it

1510
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:04,330
and I will read it tomorrow on the train

1511
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:07,000
sounds exciting

1512
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:09,100
thank you Michael maybe you meant I

1513
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,050
would like to see the example at some

1514
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:14,040
point in time but I interpreted it I

1515
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:19,330
would like to see it as soon as possible

1516
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:20,740
yeah yes so after the reviews the

1517
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:23,670
discussion continued on the list

1518
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:26,530
especially between militia and Michael

1519
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:28,480
to cover the particular aspect of key

1520
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:30,570
renewal in the network so right now

1521
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,400
using the the minimal security framework

1522
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:35,650
in the joy response we are additionally

1523
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,089
additionally providing also the the

1524
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:40,750
permutation keys needed to implement

1525
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:42,940
this solution and in case you have

1526
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:44,110
network cracking essentially well you

1527
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,089
are supposed to use the same message

1528
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:49,389
again and distribute new permutation

1529
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:51,430
keys as well of course different nodes

1530
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:53,490
will get the new key sets at different

1531
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:57,250
time so for while you might have

1532
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:58,570
misalign permutation keys and different

1533
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,640
schedules will be produced for a while

1534
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:03,429
and this needs to be minimized at least

1535
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,990
as an impact so the big question is when

1536
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:08,260
are you supposed to switch to the new

1537
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:10,179
permutation keys and the best answer is

1538
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:14,950
apparently well not exactly when you

1539
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:16,330
switch to the new network is that was

1540
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:18,099
followed by a pretty complicated

1541
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:20,080
discussion on the list that I'm trying

1542
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:23,620
to summarize here in this slide that

1543
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:27,190
looked like a promising way forward we

1544
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:31,120
need yet further parameter in the joy

1545
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:33,099
response as a permutation index that is

1546
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:36,220
essentially incremented at every working

1547
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:38,830
it indicates the epoch of your

1548
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:42,760
permutation kiss o una vocally your

1549
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:45,850
permutation key set then how the switch

1550
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,850
can happen based on that well the exact

1551
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:51,130
permutation key you want to switch to

1552
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:53,350
can be included in indiana's beacons as

1553
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:57,310
a newly allocated information element

1554
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:59,760
value such and this becomes protected

1555
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:02,260
with the new network is key set will be

1556
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,930
sent in the network by the trusted

1557
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,780
border router and the network knows that

1558
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:10,120
some point will start eventually to be

1559
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,160
able to process and validate that an end

1560
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:13,990
speaking will for sure have

1561
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,389
of course network is also the new

1562
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:17,619
permutation keys and at that moment they

1563
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:19,929
will switch to them

1564
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:25,449
and we'll start producing the the new

1565
01:17:19,929 --> 01:17:27,999
schedule summary we address the reviews

1566
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:31,178
and we have a big open point with the

1567
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:33,699
promising direction especially to when

1568
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:36,280
to switch to the new permutation keys in

1569
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:38,648
the presence of network cracking so all

1570
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:42,219
considering the status of the document

1571
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:43,899
the outcomes from the reviews we believe

1572
01:17:42,219 --> 01:17:47,979
this is in shape for working group

1573
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:51,909
adoption consideration so I guess this

1574
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:56,559
is a question for the chairs okay so the

1575
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:57,999
one thing is that 3 depends if the

1576
01:17:56,559 --> 01:17:59,019
workgroup continues or does that

1577
01:17:57,999 --> 01:18:00,309
continue because end up teaching

1578
01:17:59,019 --> 01:18:02,949
something in a while group which will

1579
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:05,379
stop you know it doesn't make much sense

1580
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:08,619
another question is like for Tarot

1581
01:18:05,379 --> 01:18:11,559
because you're the only 802 the 54 hat

1582
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:13,449
in this room is like what I've seen

1583
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:15,159
about you know we change the keys like

1584
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:18,159
we do for the other layer to kiss so

1585
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:20,199
it's our job but once we get there all

1586
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,789
that I see described here seems to be a

1587
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:24,489
ballet operation we don't actually

1588
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:28,148
control whether where the sounds are you

1589
01:18:24,489 --> 01:18:30,280
do so it's you know you feel personally

1590
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:31,929
at off that it's very interesting work

1591
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:40,719
but they also feel that it belongs to

1592
01:18:31,929 --> 01:18:43,839
unit to us there are given a yeah I

1593
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:46,059
think it's going to be more like a baby

1594
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:49,030
is it should being done in the Mac it's

1595
01:18:46,059 --> 01:18:50,829
really actually part of the work because

1596
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:52,268
one of the problem is that they up

1597
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:53,768
earlier doesn't know anything but link

1598
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,869
it doesn't know anything or a player

1599
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:58,629
doesn't know which link first used to

1600
01:18:55,869 --> 01:19:00,938
sent the frame out it doesn't know what

1601
01:18:58,629 --> 01:19:03,459
time slot or ASN or her channel is sent

1602
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:05,319
to frame out it just it's just

1603
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:08,199
configuration to the Mac macro then

1604
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:09,639
running stuff anyway yes you could do

1605
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:12,428
you could actually change that you know

1606
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:14,829
the channel you know hop in sequence

1607
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:16,449
every now and then would actually give

1608
01:19:14,829 --> 01:19:20,199
you certain you know these kind of

1609
01:19:16,449 --> 01:19:21,969
features but but you know but do that

1610
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:24,339
but but of course the problem is that a

1611
01:19:21,969 --> 01:19:26,409
player can't coordinate that they can

1612
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:29,349
say ok I do it now and Mac will do it

1613
01:19:26,409 --> 01:19:30,099
you know 10 a sense later because that's

1614
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:32,110
when it

1615
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,840
everything that the Stanford epilator

1616
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:38,019
happens at some point of time in the

1617
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:42,460
future in the back and there's no way of

1618
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:44,230
you know to coordinate or force the

1619
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:47,920
upper layer to do a lot of math to do

1620
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:50,080
something you know so then I don't think

1621
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,700
it actually would be very yes in some

1622
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,230
implementations you probably if you do

1623
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:56,260
everything a software you can't do it

1624
01:19:53,230 --> 01:20:00,370
but it wouldn't be part of the you know

1625
01:19:56,260 --> 01:20:03,460
standard 15 4 or let's put tape if you

1626
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:05,260
do 15 4 thca its implementation it might

1627
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:07,030
not be able to allow you to do that it

1628
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:08,170
might be saying oh I mean I'm just you

1629
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:11,230
know implementing things that are

1630
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:12,430
required by I Triple E and they don't

1631
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:14,709
require you to have these kind of

1632
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:16,960
features that would allow you to mess up

1633
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:18,730
the scheduling it that way so how could

1634
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,740
we progress if we wanted to have this

1635
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:23,230
happening should we propose it to I

1636
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:25,750
Triple E present it yeah I think

1637
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:27,910
actually yeah it probably would be a new

1638
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:29,350
mode to th-th you know software there is

1639
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:31,269
a couple of things that are happening at

1640
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:35,050
different files that are doing a little

1641
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:40,390
bit similar things but the question is

1642
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:42,010
that's how much you actually how much

1643
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:43,120
it's going to be really used because

1644
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:44,800
that's actually is one of the things

1645
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,290
that because you need to have a you need

1646
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,910
to be able to have an know I Triple E we

1647
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:51,070
have a power you have to have a power

1648
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:53,200
which tells you what projects are going

1649
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:54,969
to be doing and then you need to have

1650
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,370
this error of great criteria saying that

1651
01:20:54,970 --> 01:21:00,220
you need to have a void market you know

1652
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:02,200
use for it it doesn't enough to be easy

1653
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:03,790
enough to be all we in academia will

1654
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,679
think of it be nice to have this kind of

1655
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:07,480
feature that's not enough for them they

1656
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:10,630
don't want to start standardizing T if

1657
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,280
it's only for you know some very limited

1658
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:13,840
use they want to have you know lots of

1659
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,910
people they would actually would need to

1660
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,370
have some real hardware vendors

1661
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:20,470
implementing or say that they're going

1662
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:21,970
to be opening this otherwise they did

1663
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:24,970
they are not and actually you know more

1664
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:26,440
than just one so let's continue on the

1665
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:29,230
mailing list to see if there is a way to

1666
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,940
progress this with yeah and I think it

1667
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:33,280
actually Pat Kinney would probably the

1668
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:35,160
best person to ask because he's notion

1669
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,750
of th-th and he knows start to believe

1670
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:39,760
contact for six dishes our liaison or

1671
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:42,370
something right so so to do for the

1672
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,149
chairs I didn't start a discussion with

1673
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:46,389
Pat Kimmi

1674
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:47,889
and yourself and see because I mean

1675
01:21:46,389 --> 01:21:50,079
without support from a triple-a this

1676
01:21:47,889 --> 01:21:52,090
isn't get out right it has to happen

1677
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:55,360
there because they have to control of

1678
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:58,959
what you're suggesting we don't have

1679
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:01,539
without okay thank you okay with this we

1680
01:21:58,959 --> 01:22:03,729
are closing this meeting so thank you

1681
01:22:01,539 --> 01:22:07,239
all it's probably not the last sixties

1682
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:09,129
meeting we hope we meet in bangkok after

1683
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:11,648
that all bets are off so we will discuss

1684
01:22:09,129 --> 01:22:13,059
with Suresh if we're each other for

1685
01:22:11,649 --> 01:22:15,789
scheduling the time slots for the

1686
01:22:13,059 --> 01:22:17,860
deterministic success or if we just

1687
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:22,829
close this clock but with dome obviously

1688
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:22,829
you could not be with us today thank you

1689
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,730
you
