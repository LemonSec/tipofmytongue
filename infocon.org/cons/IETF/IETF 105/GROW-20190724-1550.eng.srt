you're not supposed to be in the Gro

4
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,300
meeting you could go outside and help us

5
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,440
out if you're standing in the back and

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,828
you're supposed to be in the Gro meeting

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,349
perhaps you could sit down

8
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:55,019
hello you in the back thank you good bye

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,969

00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:57,899
the Gro meeting in ITF 105 if you're not

11
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,339
supposed to be in here

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,269
you could stay it might be fun or you

13
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,998
could go to your meeting you're supposed

14
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:04,860
to be at if you're presenting you should

15
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:09,200
definitely either stand at the mic and

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,200
speak into it like this or hold the mic

17
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:15,479
okay now those presenting have a little

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,890
clicker it has a forward and a reverse

19
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,070
it also has a pointy at the screen thing

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,030
okay

21
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,469
there's a thing in front of you so you

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,640

23
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:29,189

26
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:37,259
resources online the Jabir's thing all

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
the meeting materials that are gonna be

28
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,350
presented are already posted online so

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,359
you grab those and look at them at your

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,719
own leisure there's a jabber room where

31
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:51,589
natalie is hopefully scribing for us

32
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:59,219
we'll need a note-taker

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:01,340
Warren Kumari okay restrictions anybody

34
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,339
else

35
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:13,260
Jarrod's gonna do some notes for us good

36
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:16,319
now we move on okay you see you found

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,060
your paring all right

38
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,429
there's blue sheets they're going around

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,569
please be sure to sign them so we can

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,680
get a room this size or larger next time

41
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,390
we have a minute sticker jabber scribe

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,110
we're gonna do some agenda bashing

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,600
really just gonna show you the agenda

44
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,010
stuff about existing drafts we have some

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,209
things this is I think all up to date

46
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:44,488
actually even we hope okay a couple

47
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,620
things in ini ESG reviewer headed that

48
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,540
direction there's a question about

49
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,250
whether we should adopt something or not

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,500
I think that might not actually have

51
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,910
been sent out yet if you have a draft

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,080
and you're wondering gosh is somebody

53
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,880
gonna do something about this and my

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,860
draft it's so cool you should let the

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
chairs know or ask on list for what you

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,069
think is the next step either if it's

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,380
not adopted ask for it to be adopted if

58
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,458
it's currently got a bunch of comments

59
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,600
and you've dealt with all those you know

60
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,940
you're ready to push it forward please

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:17,609
let us know to send it for your last

62
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:18,660
call asking often is probably fine job

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:27,090
you wanna say something about the IDR

64
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:30,390
recharter yes our brethren ATS the IDR

65
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:34,200
working group are looking for inputs in

66
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,988
context of a new charter so if we as

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,750
operational community have feedback as

68
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,549
to what about the bgp protocol should

69
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,100
look like on the wire and in its

70
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,709
behaviors now it's a great time to

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,160
review those email threats and provides

72
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,650
your inputs to IDR so please take that

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,019
under advisement I don't know when the

74
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,829
chartering process will stop but I

75
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,540
expect that if you give feedback in the

76
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,900
next one or two weeks it can be taken

77
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,900
into consideration

78
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:15,600
jon's better idea or co-chair yes thank

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,450
you and we will be talking about this in

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,840
our Friday meeting so welcome to show up

81
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,099
that and putting your two cents yes in

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,969
the next few weeks would be a really

83
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,820
good time to provide input and just to

84
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,420
briefly reiterate what Alvaro said at

85
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,290
our meeting that disk included you know

86
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:41,340
we're we're our desire is to keep the

87
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:44,920
sort of overall Charter statement

88
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,469
relatively broad and to track nitty

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,750
gritty details in the milestones so

90
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,400
we're very glad to take in nitty gritty

91
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,200
details but they're likely to end up in

92
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,090
the milestones portion and not in the

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:02,890
Charter proper Thanks thank you John

94
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:07,119
then a small updates on then a question

95
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:13,360
from the jabber chat room yeah

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,760
question from Illya to Bynum where is

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:25,420
the guidance on which idea related

98
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:31,140
topics go where the idea of topics go to

99
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:35,050
the IDR working group Jones cutter again

100
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,669
that is exactly what the IDR chairs were

101
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,560
talking with the ad is about this

102
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:42,820
morning and I think it will be relevant

103
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,150
to the IDR charter discussion so yes

104
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,219
there we hope to have more guidance of

105
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,979
that nature that appears in the IDR

106
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:57,190
Charter and possibly in the charters of

107
00:05:50,980 --> 00:06:00,490
related working groups thank you a small

108
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:04,600
update on evolving documents or living

109
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,300
documents at the last ITF we spoke

110
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,760
briefly about the concept of a faster

111
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,790
publication mechanism to bring

112
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,580
operational guidance faster to the

113
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:21,760
various stakeholders and users of the

114
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:24,010
BGP protocol the isg currently is

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,570
reviewing this concept and coming up

116
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,330
with proposals to more tonight in the

117
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,099
ITF plenary there will be an update from

118
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,349
Warren Kumari

119
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:43,419
on this topic and tomorrow morning at

120
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:47,130
half past eight what you showed me

121
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,419
slides I'll step notes for tonight

122
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,000
morrow I'm not opening that kind of

123
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,870
wounds there hmm

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,520
no there's not gonna be an update

125
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,910
tonight or if there is it the first I've

126
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,430
heard about it there will not be an

127
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,040
update tonight but tomorrow morning at

128
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,070
half past eight in this very room do

129
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:10,810
liffe there is a gathering to discuss

130
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:12,969
the concept of documents that are not

131
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,360
RFC's and I think that would be

132
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,120
interesting to the operational community

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,380
to have such a tool so if you're

134
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,669
agreeing with that please come to the

135
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,460
site meeting tomorrow morning and

136
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:26,460
provide your feedback on these ideas

137
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:36,280
no Mike my apologies so tomorrow morning

138
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,830
half past 8:00 this room will talk about

139
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,719
living documents were evolving documents

140
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,719
or whatever it's called tomorrow morning

141
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,850
[Music]

142
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,780
all right we can start with the

143
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,740
presentations I would like to invite

144
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:11,349
Alex to talk about leak detection and

145
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:13,690
mitigation hello everyone my name again

146
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,500
is Alexander azimuth I work for Yandex

147
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,960
and now without harsh I would like to

148
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:25,450
discuss with you around leak mitigation

149
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:28,450
solutions for those who was not at the

150
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:34,088
idea I will just recap for the most

151
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:36,640
crucial points so previously we had two

152
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,589
types of signals for roughly prevention

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,520
and another signal for route leak

154
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:44,740
detection the first rule says if route

155
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,270
is received from provider route server

156
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,160
or peer

157
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,880
it must not be sent to another provider

158
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,760
appearing so the only direction that is

159
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,850
applicable is customer so you may send

160
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,910
your prefixes only to customers the

161
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,930
second rule if route is sent to customer

162
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:07,600
peer or route server client it also must

163
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:12,160
follow all the down rule in other words

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,910
again it must this may be sent only to

165
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,400
customers so the rules are fully contact

166
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,829
become compatible varnas working on

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:29,670
egress the other one is working on

168
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:33,010
egress so yeah I understand so yeah yeah

169
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:39,660
he is noise from outside yeah I want

170
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:44,170
this good ok ok I'll try to do this way

171
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,959
so we decided to make it's a joint

172
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:50,560
signal and modern we will have two

173
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,460
signals there was a argument about which

174
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,280
one which which is one is better

175
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,770
attribute or community attribute has a

176
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,220
lot of advantages it's more reliable

177
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:07,090
it's memory efficient it has a reserve

178
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,680
to use but the community can be deployed

179
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:14,050
tomorrow or a day after tomorrow so we

180
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,469
will we would like to have advantages of

181
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:20,229
both approaches we will have community

182
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,200
tomorrow and in the attribute the day

183
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,830
after tomorrow maybe later

184
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,820
so here is the specification for

185
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:32,620
community it's nearly models OTC

186
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,020
behavior that I present it

187
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:40,480
if the idea on working group so we

188
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,810
suggest to reserve this class for

189
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,860
well-known transit communities so these

190
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:52,900
communities should not be stripped on

191
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:56,830
ingress so the first one is just sub

192
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,100
class for do community and the video is

193
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:03,000
carrot is the autumn system number

194
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:08,190
how this weather is set like in how to

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,990
see on egress if you are sending it from

196
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:15,480
provider peer or internet exchange or

197
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,720
router you are setting it with value of

198
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,030
your other known system number on

199
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,170
receiver if you are if you are customer

200
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:27,540
or beer

201
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,300
you are also setting it with this number

202
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,900
so it's doesn't matter if it's a set

203
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:37,829
organ egress or ingress the Whaley will

204
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:42,959
be just the same it works nearly the

205
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:45,570
same like OTC so as we discussed for in

206
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,380
this example we have provided on left

207
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,050
side is - is taking transit from its

208
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:58,560
provider it's also has a pier on the

209
00:11:52,050 --> 00:12:01,890
right hand side the signal now in this

210
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,310
particular example community is set may

211
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:07,530
be set on ingress may be set on egress

212
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,640
it doesn't matter the value will be the

213
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:14,250
same so when it goes through the network

214
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,680
to prevent network from leaking it does

215
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:21,300
not need to match the class of the

216
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,420
community there only difference from yo

217
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,859
TC having not either or ot see happening

218
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,800
on egress at the level of ice 3 imagine

219
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,170
that ice 2 is not filtering and so it's

220
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,329
a liquor unfortunately we are not able

221
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,050
with community image in a single

222
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:44,730
community means image create a rule that

223
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:47,280
says image for class and doesn't match

224
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,760
for video so this rule must be

225
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,060
transformed into 2 majors first check

226
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,660
that is - is not setting the community

227
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:01,739
second check the class so it is based on

228
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,560
the assumption that if ice 2 is adding

229
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,570
marking its also makes filtering it's

230
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,239
very important and we'll get back to

231
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:15,690
this few

232
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:19,470
so the most important question what we

233
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,840
should do if we detect a root leak so

234
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,810
there are three common options we should

235
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:31,350
drop it we should set a local proof to

236
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:34,560
zero or just let it go so drop it is

237
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:37,140
clear I will not describe well describe

238
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,069
it in detail let's move to the second

239
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,640
option a local prep zero the previous

240
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:48,650
versions of the draft suggest these kind

241
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,680
of behavior and the idea was that maybe

242
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:58,980
there is a customer that has only single

243
00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:02,750
path from all originator to a t1 and if

244
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:06,150
ralick happens in this part and

245
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:10,620
immediate upper provider accepts it and

246
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,939
then next level provider the texas and

247
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,830
drop it we may end up that roughtly

248
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,590
results in connectivity loss for the

249
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:22,050
victim and for this case with the

250
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,870
thought that local preference zero can

251
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:28,530
solve the problem for the in these

252
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:31,410
unreliable topology but it's his very

253
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:35,449
important side effects so first go into

254
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,449
side effects just see the number of

255
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,410
actions this must happen at the same

256
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:47,550
time to make network unreachable so it's

257
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:51,540
not very likely situation so let's go to

258
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:54,719
the side effects first one happens

259
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,939
because of when root Lee is propagating

260
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,020
through the upstream providers they are

261
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:06,270
still able to detect it but when such

262
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:08,790
prefix goes down the network lose lose

263
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,850
this opportunity to say if it was

264
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,730
erratic or not so it may become more

265
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,710
preferable we are getting in situation

266
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,240
with priority loops BGP wages and in

267
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,449
some specific to a topologist even

268
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:29,910
stable BP oscillations with

269
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:32,040
Buju pillows so it's not tasting this

270
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,639
situation can be fixed with additional

271
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,309
signal but even with additional signal

272
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,639
that says for example we detected a root

273
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:43,850
leak we cannot guarantee for these

274
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,769
customer with unreliable topology that

275
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,929
prefix will become reachable because it

276
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,699
will depend on the on the policy of

277
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,639
other parties you are saying there

278
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,849
I'm propagating a root leak many

279
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,220
providers will just drop it ok but it's

280
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:04,139
not the full problem the biggest problem

281
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:07,379
is prefixes that has a specified policy

282
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:09,239
that restricts its propagation it might

283
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,019
be done in different ways it may be

284
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:15,629
because I'm using some control community

285
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,730
to limit the ways prefixes is propagated

286
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:23,669
by my upstream problem by mega upstream

287
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:25,499
provider thank you then it may be most

288
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:28,379
specific prefix that is sent only

289
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:31,410
through internet exchange point so there

290
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:34,579
are many kinds of such policy when

291
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:38,160
prefix becomes partially visible and

292
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:42,628
from receiver side we are not capable to

293
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:46,858
just in to say if the leaked prefix that

294
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:49,799
is received from your customer is poo

295
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:52,949
proper cause a poo in direct customer

296
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:57,439
with unreliable topology of if it's a

297
00:16:52,949 --> 00:17:00,179
CDN that had such such policy its

298
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:03,480
advertising more specific and you are

299
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:07,980
going to ruin its connectivity plus ruin

300
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,789
your own connectivity to the CDN so this

301
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,510
is just a highlight

302
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:15,809
I made this calculation yesterday and it

303
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:20,089
shows the number of prefixes and its

304
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:24,418
visibility it's based on right breeze

305
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:28,590
data source all small producers this has

306
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:31,380
length more than 24 I ignored so you see

307
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:34,039
the number of effective prefixes is

308
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,039
really high

309
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:45,080
the only safe way to mitigate root leaks

310
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:47,150
is to drop them all other ways like

311
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,600
local preference zero or anything else

312
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:53,030
will result that you will create a hole

313
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,780
in a security solution and one day we

314
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,639
will shoot your own leg with it

315
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,309
the only exception may happen when at

316
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,679
the time of early adoption one may want

317
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,960
to see the signal before making a

318
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,010
decision that we are ready to implement

319
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,980
implement drop policy it can be done but

320
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,410
with caution as we discussed previously

321
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,929
we if we see marking from a neighbor I

322
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,950
oughta know sister number we have an

323
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:23,210
assumption that it's have drop policy

324
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:28,490
otherwise we are losing the signal

325
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:32,120
so if you are going to to do only

326
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,500
marking you should go a full of these

327
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,649
limitations they will be described

328
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:42,669
described in the next version of the

329
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:45,140
drop so here is the result the only

330
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:48,350
opportunity to mitigate root leaks is to

331
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:52,370
drop them you must you should follow

332
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,969
this rule there are the only option is

333
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,580
just to pass it by but you're accepting

334
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:02,390
root leaks you may say into your egress

335
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:06,070
traffic to a black hole what are the

336
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:08,690
next steps we really need your feedback

337
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,090
we find the good consensus among the

338
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,830
authors in the version that is in

339
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,918
mailing list with the miners changes

340
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,750
will be uploaded into the tracker I hope

341
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,990
that I will be able to do it and during

342
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:24,860
this week we also will require ion

343
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,900
allocations for class this will say that

344
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,678
we have well known trans communities

345
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,040
plus a sub class for leak detection

346
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:37,820
prevention and so on and we really need

347
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:40,250
to go forward to have a fast working

348
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,200
group last call because if we will eat

349
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,360
for years there will be no reason for

350
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,900
this solution because I will have a more

351
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,199
reliable OTC or a spay in place so thank

352
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,200
you for listening

353
00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:01,490
speaking as I don't know what's but I

354
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,680
would obsess you to not refer to values

355
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:07,610
that have not been assigned but put in

356
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,640
TBD to be determined okay okay but if

357
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,300
I'm thinking but I just like this number

358
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,810
a lot of people like that number that's

359
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:20,030
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I understand it

360
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:23,780
was made one of my two points second

361
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,610
point is that large communities were for

362
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,920
various reasons designed to not have

363
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,350
resort values so one of the things you

364
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,850
need to be aware of is that regardless

365
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,260
of what working group this happens and

366
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,790
you're about to make a operational

367
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,370
change and having I Anna carve out a

368
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,860
piece and know sort of like the

369
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,469
well-known stuff for you know 1997 ones

370
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,899
you what thunders eventually have magic

371
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,810
behaviors for those think about this

372
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,190
stuff why a little bit more widely and

373
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,300
coordinating with IDR about what happens

374
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,950
with large communities where they would

375
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,930
actually carve out a range of values

376
00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:03,470
similar what's the 9090 so it okay and

377
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:04,880
Jeff thanks for your comment before

378
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:11,620
asking you ask you the next question

379
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:14,930
just so from the point of process so

380
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,750
where should we differ request the class

381
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:20,240
to be resolved from the Ayana in these

382
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,280
draft or it should be another work

383
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:28,010
because we need a subclass of course in

384
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,090
a different draft which coincidentally

385
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:34,910
is on the to-do list of the chairs of

386
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,790
this working group we can instantiate a

387
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,650
registry and that draft will allow us to

388
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:43,129
discuss the concept of a registry and

389
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,900
see if IDR and andro agree that there

390
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,240
should be a registry and once that

391
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,450
registry exists then your draft can just

392
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,000
request a value from that registry so

393
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:56,900
may ask the chairs of the working group

394
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,640
to move forward with this work come on

395
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:03,130
Chris yes good thank you for your

396
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,360
feedback

397
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:10,130
can you back up me I think it's one

398
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,209
slide back I think what we agreed was

399
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:17,450
that the wording is that the default

400
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:20,799
mitigation policy should be must reject

401
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,910
and that you should follow the default

402
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,299
otherwise I don't know what it means to

403
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:31,610
say the only acceptable policy is you

404
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:36,230
see it's very important voting the only

405
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:39,080
acceptable mitigation policy the only

406
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:44,510
acceptable mitigation policy it's not

407
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:46,668
it's not yes yes yes oh you when you're

408
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:58,700
doing only marking we are not doing

409
00:22:46,669 --> 00:23:01,789
mitigation its word brain surgery or

410
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,860
something okay we can let's try to be a

411
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:09,740
little bit more clear about it okay okay

412
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,209
here then medicine work online yeah I

413
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,770
found that confusing but I was just

414
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,929
about able to pass it my understanding

415
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:21,740
reading that is that the only thing that

416
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:25,039
is mitigation is rejecting and you may

417
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,429
or may not choose to mitigate yes that's

418
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,658
correct

419
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:31,880
I prefer that construction to having a

420
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,309
recommended default I don't think

421
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,679
anything other than dropping leaks is

422
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,030
mitigation and dressing something else

423
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,340
up because mitigation is

424
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:45,530
counterproductive and I think we saw

425
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:48,080
that in origin validation for years okay

426
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:53,660
then thank you for the comment because I

427
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:56,570
fully in line with you any anak

428
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:01,810
patience Commons seems to prove that we

429
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,810
are happy good thank you for your time

430
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,329
[Music]

431
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:17,410
who is next

432
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,410
I think you're next

433
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:30,709
nope nope nope that's the next one no

434
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:35,800
that's not mine

435
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:43,820
this is doing yes all right

436
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:49,460
there's no box here fantastic so I am

437
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:54,620
Paulo and finally I have only one slide

438
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:57,080
for two drafts so I hope we are on the

439
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,330
right path so I would like first of all

440
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:09,129
to present around la crib and utter

441
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:11,629
about more MORE yes perfect and so so

442
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,260
this is the only slide that I have on

443
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:18,500
these two drafts right we presented in

444
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,540
2017 there is a lot of backup slides in

445
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,270
this presentation on the motivation why

446
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,980
we are doing this and things like that

447
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:30,020
that key takeaways that we are adding

448
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:34,700
important advantage points over the

449
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:37,010
existing RFC of BMP so in the existing

450
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,260
RFC we have a tree being pre and post

451
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:44,030
policies we are adding block creep and

452
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:46,610
other about pre and post policies we

453
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:52,160
since the last IDF only minor changes

454
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:55,310
right are about is seeing IE SG review

455
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,050
and feedback was processed and things

456
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,409
like that I think things are going well

457
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:03,320
and the forelock crib which is the one

458
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:06,740
that is a slightly more active we did

459
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,169
process the feedback of Jeff has thanks

460
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,860
for very much for the feedback here the

461
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:15,309
plenty of feedback now if you grab

462
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,229
through the document there is no feeb

463
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:19,970
wording anymore that is maybe one of the

464
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,700
most important thing plus many other

465
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:25,130
things and while I was processing his

466
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:30,100
feedback I captured something else that

467
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:32,870
we have TLV about vrf and table name and

468
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:37,820
table name is for example if you have a

469
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:40,340
slice a partition specific view that you

470
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,330
are passing of the lock rib and vrf it's

471
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:47,360
vrf right and so it's possible that you

472
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,980
want to have this TLV repeated multiple

473
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,409
times i catched it while i was

474
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,710
processing his feedback so some tax was

475
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:59,540
added to it and that is pretty much it

476
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:03,620
right now if you remember last time at

477
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:07,639
ITF 104 there was quite some queue of

478
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:11,809
people you know asking question around

479
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,900
you know what goes in block rape active

480
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:18,170
routes all routes installed routes and

481
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:20,570
things like that right and it is true

482
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,270
this draft is maybe a little bit under

483
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:26,090
it under determines a little bit what

484
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:30,830
goes in lockrey but any question that

485
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:33,260
you would still have around that I ask

486
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,750
you if you can hold your tongue for the

487
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:40,760
next next presentation where there will

488
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:44,230
be Camilo here because it may be the

489
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:48,020
most proper you know presentation to

490
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:51,860
document where to ask this about BMP

491
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:54,500
path marking so any questions and

492
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:59,570
anything can I go to the next

493
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,370
presentation you may sure can I get the

494
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:09,370
next presentation let's hope we can find

495
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:09,370
it no no no yes

496
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,250
so the second presentation I wanted to

497
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:21,809
the second sorry draft I wanted to speak

498
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:24,270
what is a draft about a tlvs the

499
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,950
original title and it's something that I

500
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,100
am doing myself with young young and

501
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,770
Hank and his remote a Hank we love you

502
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,059
so much

503
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,550
so the original title of the

504
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:40,020
presentation was the title of the draft

505
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:44,629
but the other day I was given a lesson

506
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,820
about how in the intent-based tinks era

507
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,350
we should the focus also yeah IETF

508
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,830
documents on interns

509
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:57,080
so the real title is future proofing BMP

510
00:28:52,830 --> 00:29:00,409
thank you Jeff again for the suggestion

511
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:05,070
so a little bit of background or history

512
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:09,000
behind this draft is that if you

513
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:12,659
remember like one year ago Hank he

514
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,280
presented you he wrote a document about

515
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:20,520
how to make BMP more extensible I myself

516
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,660
was a supporter of that draft and also

517
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,610
we met in person with Hank and this is

518
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,760
Interop meeting between me and Hank in

519
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:33,719
which he was exporting from a Nokia

520
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,879
device you know BMP content with the

521
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,610
following the draft and I was collecting

522
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,670
it with pms ECT and we were super duper

523
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:46,080
happy because everything worked but then

524
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:50,730
what we did is a little bit of an

525
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,530
exercise about you know about you know

526
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,929
rereading the draft and things like that

527
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:59,280
because it was quite extensive draft

528
00:29:54,929 --> 00:30:02,160
right and so we could do this exercise

529
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,790
and dissect it in three main areas that

530
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,860
the draft was touching upon and so one

531
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:11,129
was very easy it was getting into use

532
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,740
cases and we should you know it's not

533
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,400
the greatest idea to compound use cases

534
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,550
with other stuff and so it was good to

535
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,160
leave the use cases alone and then it

536
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:25,340
was touching a

537
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,300
on to other areas very important one the

538
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,550
tlvs introducing tlvs in BMP not

539
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,540
introducing but making sure that all the

540
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:40,760
messages have tlvs and review message

541
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:44,540
types right and so we are here right so

542
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,580
in the tlvs so this draft essentially

543
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,760
wants to but be a little bit a child of

544
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:53,810
that draft that only addresses the tlvs

545
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,420
and why we wanted to split alt elvis

546
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,879
from the method from a review of the

547
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,930
message types so where you see we have

548
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,720
an idea to have draft in future about

549
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:08,150
that it's because you know it's two

550
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,960
different beasts right so the till these

551
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:14,810
are if you pass me the term more

552
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,030
important for a business perspective

553
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,360
right so to make more critical mass

554
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:22,520
around the protocol BMP because with

555
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,060
that you can pass more information more

556
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,879
metadata as in vendor specific data and

557
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:32,260
things like that so in a enables enables

558
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,300
further applications around the BMP and

559
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,520
on one hand you can also say so it's

560
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,889
very important and in a way I tell these

561
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,670
are very it's a very simple concept

562
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,350
right so having till this appended to

563
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,530
BMP messages we will see that there are

564
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:51,649
some parallels also there but we can say

565
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:55,810
it's easy the reviewing the message

566
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:58,940
types is more beautiful engineering

567
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:01,399
effort which is a slightly more account

568
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,920
you know complex because we can have all

569
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,570
different ideas on how we want to

570
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,860
beautify the protocol and things like

571
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:11,710
that but we can kind of say that it's a

572
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,280
you know an engineering effort more than

573
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:18,380
something with the business critical

574
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,910
sense right and so that's why I think

575
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,370
they really belong to two different

576
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:26,020
drafts and so we want to you know

577
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:28,879
separate in the two things that said

578
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,310
what is the problem statement the

579
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,190
problem statement is simply it's like we

580
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,230
have a table with four legs but not the

581
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:40,760
all the four legs are the same

582
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:44,870
right and then so not all BMP messages

583
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,610
do support tlvs right so very

584
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,929
importantly the route monitoring

585
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:54,320
messages may be the most critical one

586
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:57,320
doesn't support the till this and also

587
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,850
peer you know the peer down message

588
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:04,939
doesn't support the TLP so what is the

589
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:08,389
ideas in the draft is to add TLV not odd

590
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:12,650
allow simply allow for trailing

591
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:15,500
TLV data in the BMP messages and in

592
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:18,290
order to do that and I leave it as at

593
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,580
the last point here like a bump the

594
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:25,129
version of BMP to for essentially I want

595
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,490
to leave it as last because you know I

596
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:31,130
want really to stress that that is not

597
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,740
really the key part right so we are not

598
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,450
in a critical point you know we are not

599
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,130
twins

600
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,720
inventing a whole new protocol or or

601
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:43,040
anything like that it's really just

602
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:48,650
backward for backward compatibility so

603
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:51,980
that said I have there is one open

604
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:55,460
question in the first release of the

605
00:33:51,980 --> 00:34:01,130
draft it was on purpose left under

606
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:03,320
specified how to handle the p.r down

607
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,450
right so it's just written that also the

608
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,739
pillar the period down should I have TLV

609
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:11,600
data but the truth is that you have

610
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:14,299
three code points that allow for

611
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,270
trailing data and this data is not

612
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,000
necessarily in a TLV format there are

613
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,730
other code points that you know it's not

614
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,918
specified you know that they can add a

615
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:28,580
trailing data and things like that so

616
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:32,199
again even there you have not an even

617
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:36,489
surface and you know solutions for that

618
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:40,719
could be anything right so from the most

619
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:44,330
extreme like we have a new message type

620
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:49,310
to we duplicate the code points to we

621
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:51,409
say we have in bmp4 and so now the

622
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,389
in data should be in TLB format to

623
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:58,520
anything right so there are multiple

624
00:34:53,389 --> 00:35:01,310
solution to this problem I would maybe

625
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,330
prefer something that is a low-impact

626
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:07,130
from you know implementation perspective

627
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:09,230
but feedback is appreciated so anybody

628
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:13,790
has ideas or preferences or whatever

629
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:18,790
please let me or a small working group

630
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:24,560
adoption is there any interest yes oh

631
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:27,770
thank you please send message to list

632
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:32,320
asking for adoption sure I would and I

633
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:37,420
hope we have an exit zero that's it

634
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:42,230
thank you for your time yeah questions

635
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:43,910
no question no comments we shall move it

636
00:35:42,230 --> 00:36:10,760
to the mailing list fantastic

637
00:35:43,910 --> 00:36:15,109
I want that way back Hey so hello so I'm

638
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,880
Camilla from entity so I would like to

639
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,600
present this draft on BMP pod pod

640
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,780
marking so the goal of this wrap is

641
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,470
basically to to mark the paths in B and

642
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,800
P with our state on the on the local rip

643
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,750
mmm

644
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,690
we will have this information maybe we

645
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,150
can allow some different applications

646
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,640
you know so that means basically that if

647
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,890
you can get the pad mark as if it's

648
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,940
installing the rip if it's a backup path

649
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:45,440
if it's hopefully unresolved maybe and

650
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,720
stuff like that we are open for

651
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,700
suggestions on what else to mark either

652
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,919
the TLB mechanism that Paulo Lucinda

653
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,200
just presented so there's some faith

654
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,390
share in there this is actually a rehash

655
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,220
of a very old draft so like around 8

656
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:06,410
years ago or 7 whatever

657
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:08,868
or six we had idea of of using that path

658
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,430
and communities to actually mark so you

659
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:12,349
see that path to get all the path from

660
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,480
from a router and then using communities

661
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:17,119
to mark what type of path they were if

662
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,130
they were passed for base external or

663
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,740
stuff like that however even though

664
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:24,560
technically there was not much of an

665
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,328
issue like the philosophically is not

666
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,540
such a good idea at least and the mind

667
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:31,550
of many to monitor bgp with bgp but used

668
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,490
BMP which back then was not very much

669
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:41,240
sure now it seems to be so why not to

670
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:43,490
put it there so it still be basically

671
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,339
right now we have so this is the basic

672
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,990
idea the rest is our I mean we have the

673
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:49,130
first iteration over these maybe we can

674
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,930
we will probably improve it in the

675
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,869
future if it's interesting or not for

676
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:57,399
the group so right now we have the pad

677
00:37:53,869 --> 00:38:00,890
type and a recent string because why not

678
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,230
so the type is actually a bit field so

679
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:06,680
you can have more than one type for a

680
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:09,079
specific path I mean here are some

681
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,790
initial ideas of this so you can you can

682
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,310
mark like the path is the path is best

683
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:15,140
path or primary which basically means

684
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,290
that if you have multi path then you can

685
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,270
have multiple paths on the on the on the

686
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:25,069
install for forwarding we took that

687
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:26,930
terminology from the peak draft you can

688
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:29,450
mark whether a pack a path is a backup

689
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,990
so for instance if you don't want to run

690
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:35,000
very complex BGP simulator and you have

691
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:38,020
this information then you can use you

692
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,099
can use that for for that application

693
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,960
then you can also have for instance

694
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:45,619
unreachable next hop so you can say

695
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,359
there are path is invalid last week

696
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,060
actually I'll prove retinas and on the

697
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:56,078
ITR that we really were not sure what

698
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:58,310
unreachable next segment but whatever so

699
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,960
there's a syllabus external path there

700
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:03,259
which after six years is a still a draft

701
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,210
even though people use it I don't really

702
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,250
have an application for that at least

703
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,290
for optimization but maybe if you have

704
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,000
this information you can you can verify

705
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,550
your network or I mean the more

706
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,340
information the better I think

707
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,980
at some point there's also a recent

708
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:23,060
string because why not

709
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:25,160
so the idea here is that if you can if

710
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:28,759
the platform actually allows you to tell

711
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,069
why a path is in a particular state for

712
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,680
instance why wasn't the best or wise not

713
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:36,620
install or why is unreachable maybe the

714
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,200
next hope is a multipath is a multicast

715
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,390
address or maybe you had a cap in the

716
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,960
number of backup pad so maybe you can

717
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,339
and write that in the original string

718
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,310
this tends to be controversial I think

719
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,240
this type of reasoning strings but

720
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,290
parameterize indeed but I'm addressing

721
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,770
this information might be very

722
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:56,150
complicated and it could be useful for

723
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,550
debugging for the government blogging

724
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,930
purposes so again this is the structure

725
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:05,780
we have now we're open for suggestions

726
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:08,569
or and that's it for that side so I do

727
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:11,660
have an open question which is what

728
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:13,850
paolo mentioned before which is what

729
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,879
relationship does we'll discuss for

730
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:20,660
instance with with the local rip and the

731
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,090
other rip drop so I believe this is this

732
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:27,680
basically come from the local rip but to

733
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:29,330
actually have a rich received rich

734
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,819
information then we also need the UM

735
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,980
invalid pads and I don't know if they

736
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,720
actually the low-calorie trap allows for

737
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,500
that or not you know if it's explicit or

738
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:43,060
implicit so that's my open question and

739
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,380
that's it for me so we can go to Gareth

740
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,580
shared much Akamai can you go back a

741
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,260
couple slides slides to the reason codes

742
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,990
are back another one I think that yeah

743
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:58,400
this this one so I'm just curious where

744
00:40:53,990 --> 00:41:00,200
this registry would live because it this

745
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,370
seems like it's more of like a protocol

746
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:09,140
level message here and I'm wondering if

747
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:13,580
that if if this would live in grow or an

748
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:16,540
idea or somewhere else registries live

749
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,540
with IANA

750
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,440
Jared's point is that it's a protocol

751
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,270
generic-type behavior you know you're

752
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,670
these things can be covered by multiple

753
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,830
things elsewhere in BGP so rather than

754
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,750
to find them you know once for this

755
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,529
application should they be used for

756
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,370
other things

757
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:43,320
probably not but no question I think you

758
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:45,120
for the clarification jeff has so camilo

759
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,620
night that this conversation of this

760
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,220
part conversation already before so this

761
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:52,830
is partially for the room I like the

762
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,330
idea in general this is overlapping you

763
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,350
know some other questions you know we

764
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,720
the person that was just stuff of the

765
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,400
mike head about do we have sway it may

766
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,810
be tracing did this grout actually made

767
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,490
it through the install process no

768
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,380
intelligible for out selection that sort

769
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,500
of thing rudiger has had similar

770
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,720
comments before as well the the problem

771
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,190
with a lot of the things in this set of

772
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:16,259
states is many BGP pipelines and

773
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,730
implementations are not fully

774
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,740
synchronous you know use I can get her

775
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,200
out and it may go through several stages

776
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,419
before you actually get some of these

777
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,220
things potentially set like reach

778
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,440
ability of next hop may come very late

779
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,990
and we get around install process

780
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,960
whether things eligible for multipath is

781
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:36,359
another example so and whether or not

782
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,310
something's elected from best path so

783
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,890
people have drown selection happened

784
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,799
very far down their pipeline and the

785
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,960
problem with this is the original BMP

786
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,400
rip in at least it's a very dumb feature

787
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,810
you can just stream this stuff out

788
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,340
almost immediately if you want to if

789
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:54,150
your implementation once allow it or

790
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:56,340
come very late trying to actually tie

791
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:59,340
these things in is try and actually lock

792
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,990
the implementation down to don't send

793
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,610
anything out that tells this stuff is

794
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,669
determined and I think you might find

795
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:07,970
that actually has bad impacts and some

796
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:11,880
of the use cases ribbons used for today

797
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:15,660
so I'm graduation deaf and the local rip

798
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:21,050
for is an implementation is not if not

799
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,049
also affected by that actually far worse

800
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,820
if you want to pick like ribbon cases

801
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,160
that are good so best path you're not

802
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,990
going to know that by that point knowing

803
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,790
that it's you know installable

804
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,109
a lot of people's policy Ange will get

805
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,700
to that very quickly

806
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:38,100
that's something that's easy to pass

807
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,470
back of the DMV message reach ability

808
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,020
may vary and some of these things like

809
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:44,310
these so flags if you're actually

810
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,520
getting these as part of your local rib

811
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,529
feed look rib is only giving you the

812
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,240
active road because giving all the state

813
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,700
as it changes through the set of routes

814
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,419
they're getting altered as part of route

815
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:59,129
selection changes resolution state

816
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,710
policy whatever your than if it's just

817
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,960
nothing but there's endless churn of

818
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,660
these bits if you actually exposed them

819
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,030
that way so I guess my two pieces of

820
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,009
advice are some of these things may have

821
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,800
negative impact on the implementation if

822
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,750
you really care about them and the

823
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,940
second thing is in a low crib context

824
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,650
you'll end up with a agency if churn

825
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,320
that really doesn't give you potentially

826
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:24,450
allow useful information but if you

827
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,340
dance back to the string slide the

828
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:31,379
second piece of feedback here is that

829
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,870
this stuff is interesting it overlaps

830
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,360
the work that you nuns doing for 10

831
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,549
cents and I think there's some value out

832
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,130
of having that conversation continue in

833
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,960
relation to that but the related piece

834
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,960
of feedback that sort of goes into

835
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,170
should be put the state into EMP we

836
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,500
talked about this night a photo for BMP

837
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:55,560
is a difficult place to put this stuff

838
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,470
in because it can be you're sort of

839
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:01,020
jamming up the pipeline with more and

840
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,609
more information EMPs already pushing

841
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,550
the fire hose of information down and

842
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:08,340
drinking straw so the problem we have

843
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,260
here is that strings are useful they

844
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,630
don't compress terribly nicely the

845
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,730
protocol and this sort of just fattens

846
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,100
up the p views with information if you

847
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,380
send this with every single thing might

848
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,830
be interesting but you probably want as

849
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:28,980
a telemetry feed for interesting things

850
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:31,560
rather than as a contiguous tree and

851
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,360
Renison will come on again I suspect

852
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:39,240
Jeff is gonna have an opinion on this as

853
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:41,760
well so at least one implementation of

854
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,189
AD pass that we run has this concept of

855
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,160
marking prefect marking routes as

856
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:50,040
members of a set of

857
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:53,089
of eligible prefixes that can be

858
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,860
advertised to an ad pause capable peer

859
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:58,490
and those are this fits in quite well

860
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,740
with your your kind of your your your

861
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:04,169
your set semantics for the for the types

862
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,549
because those are you know those can be

863
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,000
entirely disjoint or they can be

864
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:12,600
entirely overlapping and I can see a use

865
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,910
case for us where in order to evaluate

866
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,730
whether or not we want to be sending

867
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,680
some larger or smaller set of prefixes

868
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,480
to a given neighbor we want to be able

869
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,029
to get an indication of what the

870
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,590
additional memory consumption is and

871
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:29,280
this potentially gives us that very

872
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:32,640
easily if we're able to stick those set

873
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,570
memberships in those in that in that

874
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,140
code set but as I first effect Jeff is

875
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,140
not going to love that

876
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:53,160
thank him a few minutes so I can say

877
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:56,759
that I was following all the draft so

878
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:59,640
it's my fault but thank you equation so

879
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,130
we have a growing number of security

880
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,920
solutions we have router region

881
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:08,150
validation we may have ASPA and other

882
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:11,910
stuff this affect BGP decision thrones'

883
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:14,880
am i right that with these recent stream

884
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:18,680
I will be able to say that the prefix

885
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,960
was not accepted because of

886
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,990
applicability or because of route leak

887
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,050
was detected I don't see why not I mean

888
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:30,419
that's why we left there open as but as

889
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,500
long as information Jeff was saying it

890
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,480
might be complicated

891
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,480
but that was one of the

892
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,800
that is all parts and ribbon information

893
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,600
of the log grip so after the decision

894
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,070
process is made if that decision was

895
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,610
made after the decision process I don't

896
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,400
see why not

897
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:57,550
obviously on my paper me doing the paper

898
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,680
I don't do the code so I obviously think

899
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,360
that is hard for two but I don't see why

900
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,710
not

901
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,420
for instance we get something that's

902
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,640
very important we can also add a type

903
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,860
for it but obviously with this is travel

904
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,950
of implementation versus what we need so

905
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:14,290
what we as customers of devices of road

906
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,689
monitoring need versus how hard it is

907
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,220
just a quick point there's 12 minutes

908
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,180
left and two presentations from Iran

909
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:25,330
still to go so quick quick quick

910
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:29,350
thank you quick okay you can always talk

911
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:38,650
about this unless - of course thank you

912
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:45,370
very much which one do you want to do

913
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:49,570
first this one yeah thanks for saving me

914
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:53,529
several minutes and uh can you hear me

915
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:57,820
clearly yes okay so um I'll do a very

916
00:48:53,530 --> 00:49:01,570
quick update on this draft and so this

917
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:07,120
one was previously presented once on ITF

918
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:11,850
103 that we use PMP to carry the ruling

919
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:15,490
detection information and where well

920
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:18,700
nothing much has changed in sense since

921
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:22,240
then but I would like to bring up a

922
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:24,669
major information here is that I want to

923
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,430
clarify the position of this draft

924
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:30,400
because there have been several works

925
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:34,060
that alex has been working on to do a

926
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:38,350
blue lake either prevention detection or

927
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:44,070
mitigation so our drafts our draft

928
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:48,970
stands here for for relief detection and

929
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:52,540
well the difference between my draft and

930
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:54,939
other works is that the detection of

931
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:59,259
root Lake happens a

932
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:01,240
actually at the local airs as far as I

933
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,000
understand and after I have also

934
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:08,078
discussed with Alex there has no no

935
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,660
message that can be used to detect the

936
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:15,240
existence of rulings that is happening

937
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:19,390
at the local s okay so are typically a

938
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:22,479
Lakes can be detected in the upstream or

939
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,379
downstream areas but not in the local s

940
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,500
okay

941
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:30,819
so that's where this draft stand okay

942
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:33,190
and a very simple example sorry

943
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:38,380
very simple idea for this dropped that

944
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:44,560
we want to use a IOT t RV to carry the

945
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:48,730
business relationship to to state what's

946
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:52,440
the current relations and then and then

947
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:56,950
at the EMP server side it can combine

948
00:50:52,440 --> 00:51:01,540
the our DT of ease from the ingress and

949
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:04,359
egress notes and then compiling to

950
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:08,170
analyze these two relationships to

951
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:12,098
detect if any rolek has actually

952
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:17,920
happened within the ass so very simple

953
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:22,770
idea any questions on this draft now

954
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,770
let's move forward to the next row

955
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:34,599
okay so instruct in this draft we use

956
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:41,170
PMP to record and trace the BGP route

957
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:44,230
policy processing and thanks for the

958
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:47,619
working groups comments and inputs since

959
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:50,410
the site EF and we have actually made a

960
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:57,569
lot of changes to the previous version

961
00:51:50,410 --> 00:52:00,509
and but today will I will first show you

962
00:51:57,569 --> 00:52:04,540
the current position of this draft and

963
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:07,599
more importantly I would like to get

964
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,890
more input from the working group how

965
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,270
this draft should

966
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:16,299
go because after I have been talking to

967
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:20,560
some of some of you like Jeff and I'm

968
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:23,680
booty girl there still exists some gaps

969
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:27,190
where with whispers back to certain

970
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,500
perspectives so yeah I would like to see

971
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:34,150
how how help the working group suggests

972
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:39,250
the draft to go and a quick recap of the

973
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:46,290
idea so this drafts this draft this

974
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:49,690
draft wait does is that a it recalls the

975
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:52,870
processing of a group policy and this is

976
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:58,060
an example that shows you what is

977
00:52:52,870 --> 00:53:05,589
exactly recorded using this proposal so

978
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:12,730
here we have the prefix 10.1.1.1 24 it

979
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:16,600
is received from a BGP peer 192.168.1.1

980
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:20,560
and then it goes through the inbound

981
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:25,920
group policy which is called Rapala CCAP

982
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:31,150
and with the node ID or item ID 100 at

983
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:35,050
time t1 and an action was applied which

984
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:40,210
is adding a community to the prefix ok

985
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:42,760
so what can we do with such data here we

986
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:45,160
list several use cases first it can be

987
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,290
used to do route policy validation for

988
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,160
example you configured a new policy to

989
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,730
do

990
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,330
maybe maybe rule ich prevention so you

991
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:58,770
add new filtering conditions and then

992
00:53:55,330 --> 00:54:02,860
you can use this function to record if

993
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:06,820
the prefixes that you care about are

994
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:10,660
actually correct or correctly a future

995
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:14,230
or not ok and also it can be used to do

996
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:18,490
root cause analysis so the root cause

997
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:21,280
analysis is not used right after the

998
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:25,660
policies policy is configured it

999
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:28,840
is actually used after a certain period

1000
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:32,680
of time when the policy was configured

1001
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:35,170
because some of the issues are only

1002
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,799
triggered when certain environment

1003
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:42,490
conditions change so that you don't know

1004
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:46,000
when the what what policy is actually

1005
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:48,250
responsible for the current issue so you

1006
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,070
need to have such record within the

1007
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,540
device and then to locate the actual

1008
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:57,010
real cost okay

1009
00:54:52,540 --> 00:55:00,070
and third example is the route

1010
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:03,820
propagation trace and there is one

1011
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:06,130
example in the draft that tells you how

1012
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:11,350
you can do that with the data recorded

1013
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:15,550
okay so here I listed the three major

1014
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:17,580
changes from the first version the first

1015
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:20,170
one is that we designed a new message

1016
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:23,410
structure which consists of two parts

1017
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:26,370
which first one is is the basic

1018
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:30,009
information part which is fixed lens and

1019
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:32,710
it tells you the the basic background

1020
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:35,130
information about the event and then the

1021
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:38,290
second part is flexible it can be

1022
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:41,400
customized according to user

1023
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:47,070
requirements either its bandwidth

1024
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:50,770
consideration or your visualization

1025
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:53,590
requirements okay and the second change

1026
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:56,610
we made is that we designed a new

1027
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:59,470
structure to represent the route policy

1028
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:02,290
basically to allow the policy training

1029
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:05,890
and policy recursion and the surfacing

1030
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:09,960
is that we add a optional TLV to to

1031
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:14,609
allow users to freely express whatever i

1032
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,610
think whatever they want okay

1033
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:24,610
so here's the message that the message

1034
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:26,500
body looks like i consists of the prefix

1035
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:30,160
information and then the event

1036
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:33,370
information so one thing I would like to

1037
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,740
mention specifically here is that how we

1038
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:37,770
define and

1039
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:41,339
event because previously there have been

1040
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:44,820
discussions on how how we can use this

1041
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:48,380
functionality some people has mentioned

1042
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:53,780
that it can be used to do programming

1043
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:57,150
execution tracing or say debugging but I

1044
00:56:53,780 --> 00:57:04,410
thought about it and and and and I would

1045
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:07,410
say this draft is not positioned should

1046
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:12,029
not be positioned in that place I would

1047
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:15,930
say this draft does the tracing at the

1048
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:18,450
policy group policy level okay so that's

1049
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,410
two things from the actual programming

1050
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:23,279
execution

1051
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:25,609
so here the event will be defined as one

1052
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:29,220
group policy execution whether it's

1053
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:32,869
mapped or a matched or or not matched

1054
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:38,609
okay so whenever a policy is executed

1055
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:42,380
there's one event generated and this is

1056
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:45,240
what each single event looks like a

1057
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:49,080
consists of major a four parts the first

1058
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:54,000
part is environment it tells you the

1059
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:56,880
time stamp in event index and other

1060
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,369
basic informations and then we have the

1061
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:04,320
second part which is the event results

1062
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:08,490
it tells you the of the BGP attributes

1063
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:11,490
right before and after the policy

1064
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:16,200
execution so this party is optional you

1065
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:20,009
can have both preamp and post policy

1066
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:22,500
attributes uploaded or you can have just

1067
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:25,200
one of them or you can have none of them

1068
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:28,080
okay and then the third part is the

1069
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,609
event course which is a policy part a

1070
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:34,350
policy part which tells you what is

1071
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:38,069
responsible for the results okay

1072
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:41,009
and according to Rudy Gers suggestion

1073
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:44,400
and now I also believe that we should

1074
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:46,740
exchange the course and the results the

1075
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,630
order of these two parts and I'll do it

1076
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,859
in the next

1077
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:53,780
and the last part is the event notes

1078
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:56,270
this is the optional TOB I mentioned

1079
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:59,570
just now and I'll show you in the later

1080
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:04,490
slides how we can use that okay so these

1081
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:08,440
three the the the the event results

1082
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:12,020
course and those parts are or optional

1083
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:16,130
so the attribute she always looked like

1084
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:19,100
that so if you have both pre and post

1085
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:23,960
policy attributes carried in one message

1086
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:27,319
and then you can have a direct one by

1087
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:30,440
one attribute comparison for before and

1088
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:33,080
after policy the reason that I add the

1089
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:36,470
true policy attribute here is that

1090
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:41,930
because sometimes we miss the recording

1091
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:45,230
of certain events so there are not

1092
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:49,669
necessarily direct relationship between

1093
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:52,880
the two events that are reported so with

1094
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:57,250
the pre policy attributes you can have a

1095
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:00,710
a very direct and straightforward with a

1096
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:04,700
visualization of the results before and

1097
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:09,110
after the palace execution okay so and

1098
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:11,960
this is a new policy a struct structure

1099
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:16,010
that we have defined previously we only

1100
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:19,850
allow one policy expressed but now we

1101
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:22,250
add the recursion and chaining

1102
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:26,240
consideration here so basically what we

1103
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:29,690
do is that we use a C bit and Arbit to

1104
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:33,020
indicate the relation the relations of

1105
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:39,050
the next policy to the previous one so

1106
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:41,600
you can stack like I would say unlimited

1107
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:44,480
but it it doesn't necessarily have to be

1108
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:47,140
like that you can stack our policies one

1109
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,810
after another with relationship

1110
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:53,930
indicated with the C and our bit and

1111
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:57,440
there's also one a policy match flag

1112
01:00:53,930 --> 01:01:01,040
which is called the M bit to tell you if

1113
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:06,830
part if a policy is actually matched or

1114
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:09,700
okay and finally we have the policy

1115
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:14,330
optional TLV here I'm thinking is that

1116
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:16,520
it can be a string type trv that can be

1117
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:20,690
used to freely express whatever the user

1118
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:24,200
wants for example the user may dumped

1119
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:27,500
him they don't want the attribute TLV or

1120
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:31,040
don't want the policy ID TLV that we

1121
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:34,880
defined he only wants maybe a conclusion

1122
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:38,000
from the device of course this is this

1123
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,820
conclusion is also generated properly

1124
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,940
from the execution results but he only

1125
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:48,310
wants such conclusion so he can use the

1126
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:52,190
optional govt to use to express that so

1127
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:57,680
yeah that's one possible usage of the

1128
01:01:52,190 --> 01:02:01,490
option HIV and well that's that and so I

1129
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:04,160
would like to have some feedbacks and

1130
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:08,890
comments from the working group because

1131
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:13,250
previously we mainly have gaps regarding

1132
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:18,620
how what what protocol should be used to

1133
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:19,670
carry such information and and also some

1134
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:26,900
other suggestions

1135
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:28,460
so if thank you very much in the

1136
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,130
interest of time I would suggest that

1137
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:35,330
feedback is provided through the mailing

1138
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:38,420
list because we've reached the end of

1139
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:42,560
our session we're actually over running

1140
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,240
by two minutes we're missing cookies

1141
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,560
thank you very much for your two

1142
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:51,799
presentations I will see you all in

1143
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:54,430
Singapore at ITF 106 see you next time

1144
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,430
thank you
