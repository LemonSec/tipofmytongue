1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm sorry another blue sheet clipboard

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,820
out there somewhere would somebody pick

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:20,698
it up okay John would you grab that

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:24,269
clipboard right quick does that say stir

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:41,940
on it just making sure that it didn't

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:43,769
get confused with the last session being

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,480
one of the first sessions you might not

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,770
have seen this slide before all along

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,319
looking through the room and I think

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,150
that I've seen all of these phases

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,670
before maybe I'm wrong if you're new

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,910
here come up and introduce yourself to

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,790
me at the end of the end of the session

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:02,879
if you're not familiar with what is on

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,908
this slide read this leg carefully now

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,539
understand the note well yet there are

17
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,969
obligations in the note well on you on

18
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:20,399
your participation in this in any

19
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:23,189
session inside the ietf here's our

20
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:25,439
intended agenda we're going to start off

21
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,589
working through the active working group

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,479
document cert delegation in our CD then

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,319
we'll get some updates on things that

24
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,979
are being sent to the isg out abandon

25
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,200
divert and in any other business team if

26
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,189
anyone who brings up any does anybody

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,189
have an agenda bash

28
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:57,210
so if we have time only if we have time

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,949
we might want to talk about the

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,169
emergency calling and what might be

31
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,979
interesting or useful or necessary or in

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:14,280
order to especially make a call back

33
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:18,680
from the 911 system which would be if

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,770
they wanted to and they often don't a

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,540
three-digit number not right well if we

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,820
if we have time we'll definitely let you

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,290
I'm assuming he'll come up and and lead

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,790
that conversation yeah

39
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:36,350
Martin Dahlia ATT this item is already

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:40,829
being worked in the IP n and I were

41
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:44,880
working with ISA to find the

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,510
requirements for when a 9-1-1 call as

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,620
dialed

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,100
getting to the pset as well as for a

45
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,100
call back

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,870
this is not what I expected to happen

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:56,740
okay I can't drive quicker all right

48
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:03,190
got something clicks you see if this

49
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:17,380
clicks no clicky is it turned on on the

50
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:20,200
back yeah does that cookie that still

51
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,738
does not seem to click eenie wait maybe

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:28,310
that worked

53
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:31,388
I now see a green light okay interesting

54
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,389
[Music]

55
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:41,289
is this time I'm like actually wrong

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:43,690
at my last meeting it was not on yet hi

57
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,060
so we are back again with this exciting

58
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,680
story about delegation which is a

59
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,090
specification we have here which is now

60
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,120
a working group item as you can see from

61
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,400
the fancy - ITF up there which basically

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,230
sets out to explain how delegation works

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,409
Forster this is something we talked

64
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,110
about in 82 2682 26 said you could just

65
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,960
kind of do delegation from these TN auth

66
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,580
list objects to other objects but we

67
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,169
figured it would probably be helpful to

68
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,469
go through and just kind of explain what

69
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,599
that

70
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,950
would mean in practice to find out if

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,780
there were gaps things we want to fill

72
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,950
in that would kind of make this make

73
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,539
more sense

74
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,280
one of the aspects of that of course is

75
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,900
dealing with certificate chains instead

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,330
of dealing with just your going to get a

77
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,159
cert from the x5u in the passport and

78
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,450
use that to figure out if you can

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
validate the call on the terminating

80
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,070
side and finally those of interaction

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,349
with Acme that that entails and this is

82
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:40,750
going to support a number of use cases

83
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:42,400
next slide we will have some pain in the

84
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,920
way this is being done as it should be

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,539
in the ITF we are the few the devout who

86
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,560
are up for the pain so why are we

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,990
talking about this I mean there's really

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,070
one basic thing that is motivating the

89
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,590
discussion about this in the industry

90
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,840
this made this so hot recently and it's

91
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,179
this prospect that sometimes outbound

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,770
calls just are not going to transit the

93
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,230
authentication service of a carrier who

94
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,270
owns the calling party number and there

95
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,710
are you know the the poster child of

96
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,650
this is this common case of an

97
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,770
enterprise say who requires tiens from

98
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,390
one provider but in fact does least cost

99
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,219
routing across a number of outbound

100
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,630
providers and what if this call is going

101
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,220
to go out through a different out phone

102
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,659
provider then the person they got the

103
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,669
numbers from how are they supposed to

104
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,410
sign it and actually a lot of the sort

105
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,729
of legitimate spoofing cases we talked

106
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,500
about sometimes these are the cases

107
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,849
where you know the doctor's office right

108
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,130
once be able to call from some number

109
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,510
and there are doctors on the road right

110
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,430
and they want to be able to attest this

111
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,469
these the things that are basically

112
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,810
motivating getting delegation done and

113
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,190
it kind of put the fire under this so we

114
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,830
want to do is want to be able to push

115
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,900
credentials from the TN owners the term

116
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,159
TN service provider I think is starting

117
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,929
to gain a little currency in the

118
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,330
industry as we talk about this from

119
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,850
those TN source riders to na s that is

120
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,890
actually able to sign for the call maybe

121
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,210
if this is an enterprise as a ton of SIF

122
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,280
infrastructure that could beat the

123
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,960
enterprise itself maybe it could be the

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,099
outbound carrier itself maybe there

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,810
could be a third party service that's

126
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,970
doing it doesn't really matter this

127
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,729
entire architecture is agnostic to those

128
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,260
sorts of questions but the reason we

129
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,510
want to do this is the bullet you see at

130
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,130
the bottom here the alternative really

131
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,250
seems to be letting outbound carriers

132
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,340
sign for calls where they don't own the

133
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,529
number and you know in the draft talks

134
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,958
about this in the motivation section

135
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,429
you know that kind of diminishes a lot

136
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,709
of the purpose of what we've been here

137
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:28,469
to try to accomplish if like basically

138
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:30,309
any carriers Camilla sign for any call

139
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,808
obviously there's a number of great

140
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,789
extremely trustworthy and responsible

141
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:35,649
carriers out there that will only sign

142
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,849
for appropriate calls for this but of

143
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,229
course those aren't the people that have

144
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,938
caused these massive problems with

145
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,008
impersonation that have led 12

146
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,389
robocalling voicemail hacking and the

147
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,279
remainder of the difficulties that we

148
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,989
face that motivated this work in the

149
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:53,289
first place

150
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:59,589
next slide feel the pain feel the burn

151
00:07:53,289 --> 00:08:02,050
of the slight advancement mechanism ok

152
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,639
so there are hard edges on this I'm not

153
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,699
going to pretend that everything about

154
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,469
this is is easy or obvious we know that

155
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,449
early deployment of ster especially in

156
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:13,209
the shaking framework is based on s pcs

157
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,279
and the notion you've got in SPC these

158
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,079
ocn level certs are something we kind of

159
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,479
bandied around in that environment and

160
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,119
you know so there's there's two real

161
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,339
ways to look at a high level at how you

162
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:28,569
do delegation from the tien awfulest

163
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:30,309
object as its defined in RC 82 26 you

164
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:33,099
know some of these non carrier entities

165
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,110
probably should have SP sees whether

166
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,779
they count as real carriers or not if

167
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,029
you were assigned large contiguous or

168
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,419
non contiguous complicated blocks of

169
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,980
five hundred thousand numbers you know I

170
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,389
don't really want to try to represent

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,639
something like that in a TN awfulest

172
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,899
object that would be nuts and we talked

173
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,079
about some of the alternatives to that

174
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:54,370
in the draft but yeah for some of these

175
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,349
entities it might make sense tit for

176
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:02,620
them to have an OC n or a pseudo OC n of

177
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:04,600
some kind yes Mary yes yeah and so and

178
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,339
again and that that process and what

179
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,800
that's gonna mean as the regulatory

180
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,410
framework or revolves around this is is

181
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,639
interesting so one important thing to

182
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,559
understand about this draft this draft

183
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,449
is not saying don't do that this draft

184
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,519
is saying there are cases where you want

185
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:20,889
to do that then there are these other

186
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,089
cases where again like new star I'll

187
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,639
take as an example of an enterprise

188
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,189
right we've had these thousand blocks

189
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,000
under five seven one four three four for

190
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,800
like twenty years

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,149
nothing gets ported in or out of them

192
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,459
they're extremely simple they're

193
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,180
contiguous and like for these kinds of

194
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,500
entities that might

195
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,060
makes sense to actually use the TN

196
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,970
blocks themselves in the certificates

197
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,439
and so I think one size doesn't fit all

198
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,910
we want to talk about some enterprise

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,740
where we're a no cm would be overkill

200
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,750
right where you really can just capture

201
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,510
these the resources this person has and

202
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,220
and push that out from that now I mean

203
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,529
the thing that makes this the hard edge

204
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,660
on this is this concept of encompassing

205
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,300
this is something that we stole in the

206
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,520
delegation mechanism from rpki our PKI

207
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,959
has this idea that the way that kind of

208
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,839
blocks trickle down from the Ayana

209
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,000
through tier one carriers to you know

210
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,459
the various entities that end up

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,520
advertising these blocks on on the

212
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:14,649
Internet is that you know each kind of

213
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,199
successive step needs to be provably

214
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,120
encompassed by its parent certificate

215
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,130
and the scope of authority of the parent

216
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,240
certificate and so there's a lot of

217
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,620
design questions in this that are

218
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,450
interesting questions and this is what

219
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,500
I'd like to talk about today if people

220
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,950
would like to get up and talk about it

221
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,720
this is an open issue in the draft you

222
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,580
know we all know that at some point the

223
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,470
rubber meets the road here

224
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,390
the verification services and the

225
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,920
terminating side of calls are gonna get

226
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,449
a call assigned by a certificate

227
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,339
it's from a calling party number and

228
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,650
they need to make some determination

229
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:48,820
should this have been signed by the

230
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:50,829
entity that signed it and you know we we

231
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,360
need to understand at least where we

232
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,070
think in the architecture the right

233
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,320
places to perform that encompassing

234
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,300
check and there are a couple of

235
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,160
alternatives for this you could do it

236
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,020
when the certs are issued for example if

237
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,969
you are delegating from some particular

238
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,329
your carry you want to delegate down to

239
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,560
a simple number block like new stars you

240
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,360
know there could be a process that

241
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,000
checks at the time that delegation is

242
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,709
performed oh yeah that's actually the

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,900
jet that could be part of the ca'se job

244
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:19,479
in other words before this gets issued

245
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,350
or maybe the PAS job would you somebody

246
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,510
in this architecture could be

247
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,860
responsible for the job of figuring out

248
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,870
whether or not this is encompassed at

249
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,060
the time the cert is issued the

250
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,880
alternative is to do it like in real

251
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,500
time when the call is being set up and

252
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,630
you know on the verification service

253
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,600
side to be able to say okay I need to do

254
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,459
some dip or understand you know that the

255
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,800
difficulty with that obviously is that

256
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:44,439
that could have an impact on the actual

257
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,109
call set-up time if you need to wait for

258
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,110
that result you know before you start

259
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,699
learning the

260
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,040
that's kind of a big deal that's a

261
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:53,750
trade-off and you know III don't know

262
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,800
the right answer and if you want to talk

263
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,750
about this now I'd love to talk about

264
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,120
this now I think you could do it in both

265
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,250
places even maybe it's maybe you need to

266
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,410
do it in both places I'd like to think

267
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,769
it is possible at least to push that to

268
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,509
the certification itself to the CAS to

269
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,310
the at least the ecosystem responsible

270
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,899
for the issuance of certificates to make

271
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,119
sure somebody checks this encompassing

272
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,560
stuff and is being like audited and

273
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,610
checked on to make sure it's actually

274
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,609
worked Marian

275
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,670
we still have a dependency on these

276
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,860
existing identifiers that are selling

277
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,569
the service providers and that's very

278
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,399
complicated right because of number

279
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,589
portability and that sort of thing right

280
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,970
it gets so it's actually if you really

281
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,139
wanted to check in on the verification

282
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,750
side you actually have to check more

283
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:42,259
than one place even sure that's it so it

284
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,569
is very complicated you could do it on

285
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,149
the authentication side right and you

286
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:49,699
cuz you're right and so your SVC token

287
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:54,160
within you would want to bind that with

288
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:56,660
your OC n and the TN right right I mean

289
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,699
right I mean and you know again this

290
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,290
architecture could allow you to bind in

291
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:05,569
OC n to another OC n is it obligation

292
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,910
right it's because you say right right

293
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,959
right and so yeah I mean I think I'm

294
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,579
much more concerned about just

295
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,739
architectural ii-if we're going to do

296
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,508
something like this you know where where

297
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,920
do we want that Authority and that

298
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:17,600
responsibility to reside in the

299
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,250
architecture my preference would be that

300
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,990
it'd be something that happens offline

301
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:31,790
I guess rather than happening during

302
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:33,079
coal processing fair enough and we are

303
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,389
only doing the plumbing here right I

304
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:37,550
mean I think we do we can offer guidance

305
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,899
to say this is the consequence of doing

306
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,189
it this way versus that way and I don't

307
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:51,709
think we're gonna tell you only do it

308
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:54,139
this way do it there in the limitations

309
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,430
right yeah I mean like in certification

310
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,410
I wouldn't leave the certification one

311
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,790
out again because it's not just the a

312
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,269
has the a s is also during call

313
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,269
processing

314
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,880
yeah yeah you could yeah you could no

315
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:16,350
two ways about it

316
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,390
Christmas Chris one I'm not sure I agree

317
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,540
that it's complex I mean it should be

318
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:24,210
possible Matt like you can do the lookup

319
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,079
onler and impact and you know there's a

320
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:30,000
mapping there that can be checked but

321
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,870
that's just a single comment I think the

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,240
broader thing I'd like to see is that we

323
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,360
enable it on both sides you know I can

324
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,360
but folks choose whether we should do it

325
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,920
on on the front end or if I want to I

326
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,690
should be able to verify it on the back

327
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,620
end as well definitely pending what I

328
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:52,740
want to do so I think that that's the

329
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,290
key thing that the end the end can be

330
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,450
validated on both sides and you don't

331
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,290
have to necessarily trust one side over

332
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:03,060
the other you can do your own yeah and I

333
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,829
mean it goes about saying that

334
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,839
verification services are going to

335
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,000
access all kinds of analytics and things

336
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,530
like that right before a call actually

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,240
ends up alerting a user and so as a

338
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,290
consequence of that sure any any number

339
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:33,350
of checks could be performed at that

340
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:39,060
point yes I think it's really useless

341
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:43,820
of course interval certificate is good

342
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:48,329
where things can change and so allowing

343
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:52,980
validation later is not a bad thing but

344
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:59,970
we do need to make sure that we are

345
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:01,380
accommodating validation yeah I mean

346
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,640
that is one of the virtues of actually

347
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,290
having the telephone numbers get

348
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,210
inscribed themselves for these

349
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,650
enterprises where it does work writing

350
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,990
it to me won't work in all cases but in

351
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:13,040
cases where it is a simple number range

352
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,740
having that in there does really help

353
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,089
verification service that does not

354
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,380
ordinarily interface with the unpack

355
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:33,740
analog and things like that to figure

356
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:35,770
out whether or not accept this call so

357
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,480
what's kind of keeping an eye on like

358
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:41,860
whether whether we're kind of an

359
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,090
engineering or ourselves circle here if

360
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,870
this if these things can only be

361
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,850
verified by doing a life check at

362
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:55,520
verifications on the PKI is adding value

363
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:58,850
yeah yeah check it ready check yep

364
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:02,180
so yeah given that we have the Sun

365
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,520
constants and DKI concepts here it seems

366
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:11,720
like maybe we shouldn't throw that away

367
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:14,240
and turn a purification hi this is Sean

368
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,770
Turner um to kind of just pile on here I

369
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,660
don't know how you would write a C key

370
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,160
that says in the validation section of a

371
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:29,540
tenant just feel like put whatever you

372
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:30,980
want in there it's gonna buy off one

373
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,139
side so at the end of the day I think

374
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,120
you have to do some pre value somewhere

375
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,560
to get some kind of one replacement for

376
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,760
the CA is actually validating the things

377
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,919
that are found on the surface otherwise

378
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,230
like Richard said what's it good for

379
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,210
so in you know just be really does put a

380
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,800
requirement on the CA right in this

381
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,210
instance to actually have access to

382
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,370
those resources and important that check

383
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,900
and that that's that's not bad

384
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:59,449
I did just something we need to note in

385
00:17:50,900 --> 00:18:02,480
the architecture and in hating again and

386
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,000
the the CA in PA functions are kind of

387
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,680
modularized out in shakin and we don't

388
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,630
design shaking here and say for the 50th

389
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,310
time but like you can imagine that being

390
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,420
the PAS job or the cas job just

391
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,679
depending on how shaken wants to carve

392
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:20,759
it up we're not gonna decide that there

393
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:23,769
i don't care yeah oh I know

394
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,419
you can actually get a daily download

395
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:29,110
now that's a newer feature in recent

396
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:34,659
years daily daily downloads very nice

397
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:36,490
it's like daily dozen yes that's good

398
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:38,590
authority token the CA doesn't

399
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,480
necessarily have to do that it should be

400
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,340
able to rely on the authority token if

401
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,249
that's part of the ecosystem that we're

402
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,259
building so you know it's not correct

403
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,990
checking budget should be able to depend

404
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:53,710
on that token yeah agree and this is

405
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,789
part of why we're not saying what we

406
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,600
want to do in acme at the moment cuz

407
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,860
we're still trying to figure this out

408
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,330
when we figured this out we'll know if

409
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,709
anything any authority token challenge

410
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:19,629
needs to actually reflect this or not so

411
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:21,999
yes something yeah yeah yeah I hear yes

412
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:24,490
sure do yep yep then there's no point in

413
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:27,659
having it all man alright next slide I

414
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,659
think we talked this one down a bit

415
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:42,460
money it's drag so um another element of

416
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:44,320
this and this goes to certification

417
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,659
authorities and what we mean by being is

418
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,149
a CA in this obviously the way this is

419
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:51,340
specified in the delegation draft now we

420
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:55,479
are assuming that you'll be able to get

421
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:58,389
a certificate from the CA if you're a

422
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,639
carrier that has this CA bit set to true

423
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:03,908
in it to enable delegation this is how

424
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,490
classic x.509 delegation works we even

425
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,990
bake that into the acme ATC mechanism so

426
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,879
that when you go to get an authority

427
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,389
token that you would then present to a

428
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:15,279
CA you can ask that Authority hey give

429
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:17,439
me something that allows me explicitly

430
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,529
to get it a certificate that I can

431
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,090
delegate from myself now that has you

432
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,700
know this has edges on it means we're

433
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:29,049
dealing with certificate chains now you

434
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,019
know if you know your if you have a CA

435
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,059
that is basically acting as the CA for

436
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,980
both the care

437
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,080
your certificate and the delegate

438
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,279
certificate in this instance probably

439
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,980
it's possible to collapse that chain

440
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,360
there are a few ways to do that and we

441
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,519
may also be able to do some cross

442
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,689
certification to consolidate credentials

443
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,789
and permissions if you're an enterprise

444
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,200
and you get numbers from like three

445
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,999
different carriers who are all

446
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,559
delegating down to you there are some

447
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,970
cross certification strategies we could

448
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,249
explore so that you as an enterprise

449
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,139
only have to hold one credential to sign

450
00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:00,269
with and say we having to choose from a

451
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:07,379
roster I have heard concerns expressed

452
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:09,330
about this in the past you know if it

453
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:12,240
turns out that it is onerous to have the

454
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,949
CA bit sad there are alternatives that

455
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,419
we can explore for this and the work

456
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,379
that I would probably steal from from

457
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:21,480
this is this ITF TLS sub certs mechanism

458
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:24,360
and a sub cert is basically a document

459
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,549
that is signed by a normal and entity

460
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,740
cert that contains most of the junk that

461
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,450
would be in a cert to begin with and

462
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,159
this is a workaround that has been

463
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,440
developed for precisely these sorts of

464
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,360
use cases where you can only get in an

465
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,019
entity cert at the web PKI is very

466
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,580
ossified this way and this would be a

467
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,570
path we could go down if for whatever

468
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,158
reason if there was enough

469
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,629
administrative pressure people didn't

470
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,559
want to be able to have the CA bit set

471
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:50,730
this is direction that we could take and

472
00:21:48,559 --> 00:22:07,830
discrete these kind of pseudo certs with

473
00:21:50,730 --> 00:22:09,480
a narrower scope yes well so we're

474
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,119
talking about potentially delegating CA

475
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,830
issuing certs in you know we're gonna

476
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,330
have multiple chains of delegation there

477
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,850
are certain kinds of service writers who

478
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,070
they get numbers from a carrier but they

479
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,860
that in turn are building those numbers

480
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,689
out to a variety of customers right and

481
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,248
so for that and since I could imagine

482
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,649
there being multiple levels actually

483
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:31,110
these delegated certs ordinarily I think

484
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,399
for typical operations if you know your

485
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,080
carrier and you have an enterprise

486
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:35,789
customer you would be giving them an EE

487
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:42,389
cert that they would then be using to

488
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:43,649
cite me certain from hey Sean Turner so

489
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,830
one of the nice things that if you do

490
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:47,439
decide to do the sister

491
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,090
like the draft eel sub sources you're

492
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,070
going to get free security analysis

493
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,590
they're gonna go off and do a security

494
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,600
proof with some guys who are smart

495
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,850
making sure that we're not slowing up

496
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,469
TLS yeah you're just gonna like

497
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,780
willy-nilly start doing things it hasn't

498
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,610
been like investigated there be dragons

499
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,410
there right so yeah it would be nice

500
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,750
that if you if you were to decide one

501
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,640
way or the other that this this idea

502
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,170
might have a little bit better feeling

503
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,400
because its security reviewer Huey would

504
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,080
have actually had a look at it and have

505
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,840
a formal proof to show that the security

506
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,790
still works yeah I mean and I'll be very

507
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,389
upfront about this my preference would

508
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:24,399
be to do classic x.509 delegation with

509
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,840
the CIA vets at it's just if it turns

510
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,090
out that there's some artificial market

511
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,370
constrain that that is going to preclude

512
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,220
that in the short term I would be

513
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,830
willing to go build a variant of sub

514
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,360
certs that works for stirrer just so we

515
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,860
could get like something out there in

516
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:49,810
the interim that would not be my

517
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:52,689
preference towards a variant of

518
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:56,050
certificates why not and Ruston's

519
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,660
criminally why don't you think about

520
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,540
proxy certificates which are x.509

521
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,650
certificates with everything is just

522
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,740
restricted regions or you actually

523
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,400
they're meant to delegate functionality

524
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,140
to someone else without being this year

525
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,790
but I think the difficulty we've had

526
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,010
when we looked at the alternatives this

527
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:18,879
has been not a lot of them support the

528
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,410
narrowing of the scope of the name and

529
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:27,040
that this is that this is the thing

530
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:28,390
that's well again this is exactly the

531
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,580
session we're just having we want the CA

532
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,870
to tell you what you need to do to

533
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,189
validate without you having to do some

534
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,889
kind of external check or something like

535
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,050
that right and so like because if we

536
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,550
hope to build that into the Cir to avoid

537
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,830
having to do a lot of verification

538
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:44,260
service kind of busy work during call

539
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,760
set up time I think that we need

540
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,290
something that has a very particular set

541
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,090
of qualities if if in fact these proxy

542
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,379
starts have that quality that you know

543
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,540
again think about it like our PGI

544
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,450
encompassing is exactly that right if

545
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,730
you've got a slash you know 16 and you

546
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,480
want to be able to just have a sub cert

547
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,390
for

548
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,500
you know 24 from that like does that

549
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:07,930
work or not with proxy certs yes but not

550
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,060
using name constraints well we don't we

551
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,440
don't actually use classic x.509 name

552
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:16,540
constraints we have our own name

553
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:20,100
constraint Varian okay we can look into

554
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,100
it good suggestion we'll look into it

555
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,700
obviously either either of these paths

556
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,230
solves the problem they're fine care

557
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,960
that we saw the problem not exactly

558
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,790
which path passed but actually slightly

559
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,410
lean towards the sub search over the

560
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,450
other one in fact that the reason why

561
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,210
sort of silly but it is every single

562
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,550
time I go to tell someone an operator or

563
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,700
an implementer that they need to manage

564
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,350
private keys for a certain you know

565
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,480
manner we will need god only knows what

566
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,399
policy to apply and when I say you need

567
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,690
to manage a token that enables you to do

568
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,830
absolutely everything in their.all

569
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,330
they're like oh yeah with this check

570
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,949
that didn't start controls the rest I

571
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,240
mean like you know like one's easy in

572
00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,130
one's heart and they're the same thing

573
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:03,630
yeah yeah okay that's good good feedback

574
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,630
and I'd like to hear other views on that

575
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:10,540
once again I think the expert 90 good

576
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,159
delegations seems a little bit cleaner

577
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,990
because we have a little bit more to

578
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,570
draw on with a more machinery that kind

579
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,700
of just works the substrates thing can

580
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,770
obviously be made to work it's pretty

581
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,960
Greenfield we can kind of make it do

582
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,030
what we need it to do we would need to

583
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,450
add some stuff to it especially wanted

584
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,430
to have multiples of delegation yeah so

585
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,630
we would have to do a one-off draft I

586
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:38,920
think we would not be able to just say

587
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:42,160
we're using that there is a nonzero

588
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,150
amount of writing code oh yes like

589
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,590
there's already some protocol

590
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,690
implementations of cloud floats roaming

591
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,240
and I think there there's a couple major

592
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,270
book players who are interested in

593
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,730
building stacks and you're not going to

594
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:59,040
get like the the interrupts the PCI code

595
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:01,600
yes but I mean in the race between the

596
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:07,300
specifics of PKI code and sub certs

597
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:10,419
might be kind of tight okay Klem Wilson

598
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,750
I'd also kind of lean towards

599
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,970
back away from Richard okay move towards

600
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,040
the subjects only because it is

601
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:21,850
something that we've already worked in

602
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,220
Lenny it's it's much more tenable as a

603
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,310
solution permit from the see a patient

604
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,640
perspective or as the xm9 delegation as

605
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,740
was mentioned is kind of a big no-no but

606
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,710
okay and so it would be harder to make

607
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,840
any structure that supports and I do get

608
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,940
I mean the anxiety Cohen expressed like

609
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,620
no carrier who is not in the business

610
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,140
running CAS one steer wait a minute I'm

611
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,250
gonna have this likes yeh serve that is

612
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,840
gonna be able like make stuff that

613
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,940
sounds like scary I don't want to do

614
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,760
that so yeah I am sympathetic to them

615
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:58,030
yes name so the TLS sub six is a little

616
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,520
bit of a misnomer it really is a key

617
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:04,020
delegation not a credential delegation

618
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,550
but conceptually what it does is is

619
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,400
tailored Eve what's valid in the

620
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,940
certificate in narrowing the scope so

621
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,590
conceptually is aligned I don't see any

622
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,900
real problem with making a completely

623
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:20,919
different variant this specific draft is

624
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:24,670
for you know key lifetime narrowing um

625
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:27,970
but I can see this some people quickly

626
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:35,380
different that's based on this okay

627
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:36,760
thanks dick okay next slide those were

628
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,560
the big questions there's like a bunch

629
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,210
of smaller questions that I think we

630
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,250
should still work out I think was

631
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,800
Richard you pointed out like there isn't

632
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:47,950
a beauty like an x5 C we could use as an

633
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,480
alternative Dex flag you and like you

634
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,000
want as a way to do certificate chains

635
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,740
you know I I worry obviously that you

636
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,180
know because passport has seen some

637
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,130
implementation already that people just

638
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,930
feel like wait a minute it's all x5u I

639
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,470
don't wanna like to have like x5c in or

640
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,890
something

641
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,850
so I guess I don't know how people feel

642
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,080
for two locked index five you in

643
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,209
passport if there's just too much code

644
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,980
out there that just assumes that what is

645
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,380
going to be in your job is gonna be XY

646
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,050
view and so you know again we we have

647
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,930
this in like it easy 25 right age 20 to

648
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:23,770
25 specifies they were using x5 you for

649
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,420
passport probably be better if we used

650
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,700
ex-wives

651
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:30,900
as long as we don't think that it'll

652
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:46,050
make implementation sparf Chris what do

653
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:48,240
you think about like that yeah I mean

654
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:51,899
it's just it's just so the like the jaw

655
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,570
like header can actually have you know X

656
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,430
5 unit or x5c and I mean it's just

657
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,530
something they defined for jaw and like

658
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,850
we can borrow ahead and use that because

659
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,920
we're gonna have these pens certificate

660
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,429
chains if there's even one more step in

661
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:11,790
you know the certificate management and

662
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:13,290
we have today so I mean it's a you know

663
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,000
we have this PEM certificate chain

664
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,470
object that is gonna get pushed you when

665
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,790
you do reference whatever the URL is

666
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,710
it's in the header and it would

667
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,409
technically be more syntactically

668
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:25,680
accurate for us to use an x5 C to point

669
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:27,660
to that chain then an x5 Richard yes no

670
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:33,180
you there's your point and you tell me I

671
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:35,850
mean I know no it's you see the URL

672
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,140
would point to it would just yeah we

673
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,820
point to the whole chain but the point

674
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,230
is I just said just stick it in x5 you

675
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,280
and forget about it right just just have

676
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:46,500
a PEM chain did you somebody made it

677
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,940
does anyone in this room when it owned

678
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:59,240
up to making a suggestion I think was

679
00:30:47,940 --> 00:31:04,440
you is a literal certificate chain right

680
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:07,530
things okay I think it's so nice my view

681
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,620
the thing I want to check out for this

682
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:12,629
use case is can you provide and multiple

683
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,459
certificates in the response there right

684
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:20,780
cuz as you talk about delegation and you

685
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,780
may have Dan I thought it worked yeah

686
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:29,879
okay okay okay right we're actually

687
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,770
currently having discussions about how

688
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,900
we're going to do the chain II don't get

689
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,430
it for shake itself but they have like

690
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,170
two weeks to figure it out because we're

691
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:42,480
gonna yeah I understand that yeah

692
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:46,100
yeah I see gives us desirable properties

693
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,300
right that we would like to have right

694
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,949
or you think I think he's shaking his

695
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,350
head easy he just wants this the for

696
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:55,770
spam but we need to talk about that yeah

697
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,719
okay okay I mean I I guess what I

698
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,580
probably say is that we could put in

699
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,450
here let's allow either and if whatever

700
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,010
people want to do is probably cool

701
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,930
Lambert this is all stuff that was in 82

702
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,970
26 I'm just gonna like make basic

703
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,620
clarifications around like what how you

704
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,890
would actually do this in practice and

705
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,570
suddenly people are interested in that

706
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,980
we erect Barger and I this morning had a

707
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,610
good discussion about this next one

708
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,350
about having a good bit you know and

709
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,179
this this does I agree I'm not I'm not

710
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,520
sure how much value it adds what I guess

711
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,940
I saw in this was I could imagine having

712
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,770
some CAS that do have access to these

713
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,750
industry databases that can go look up

714
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,550
and validate that this encompassing

715
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,770
semantics actually works but maybe there

716
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,480
others that just can't write and so it

717
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,000
might make sense to have a distinction

718
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,440
between those CAS that know they can go

719
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,300
access those databases and they would

720
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,040
put in the good bit saying I actually

721
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,570
went and did this validation whereas

722
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,100
other ones who are like I don't have

723
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,290
access to that at all I'm just like a

724
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,030
normal CA and I don't talk to the lordy

725
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,129
the unpack or something they would be

726
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,190
able to set that bit to know did you

727
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,510
people think that's stupid yeah I guess

728
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,040
it really comes down to do we think

729
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,990
there are gonna be CAS that fall into

730
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,490
both of those categories if we do it

731
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,860
seems like there there may be some value

732
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,660
having a bit that says some people go

733
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,860
and validate the encompassing semantics

734
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,640
before they issue the certificate and

735
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,830
some people don't

736
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,380
maybe so maybe no one ever shouldn't

737
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,520
right and like we just mandate no one

738
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,170
ever shouldn't okay

739
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,170
vote for no one ever shouldn't press

740
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:32,649
the JWT thing it looks to me that x5u is

741
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:40,720
a URL and ex-wives he is just explicit

742
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:43,180
it's just by volume yeah okay okay okay

743
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:48,280
I mean Mary's just saying she wants XYZ

744
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:52,570
so I mean I'm a little bit concerned

745
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,510
this is Russ that we've turned into an

746
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,980
impact centric discussion we need to

747
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,230
make sure we're building a spec that

748
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:03,070
will work worldwide

749
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,900
sure yeah thank you yeah well in these

750
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,970
tools are applicable worldwide we're

751
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:12,340
just using what the use case is it's in

752
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:21,720
front of us you can kind of have both a

753
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:31,870
chain or a certificate okay well this

754
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:33,879
will just keep exid for now yes hey this

755
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,790
is a piece of useful information that I

756
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,669
asked the validator though hey it's a

757
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,980
special super CA or I can see it as a

758
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,710
kind of restraint of trade you know all

759
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:51,550
these special people get to be really

760
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:54,070
good I would actually curious probably

761
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,870
on the list you know what people use it

762
00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:05,380
with people find it valuable or is it

763
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:06,880
just more code to write a much code but

764
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,190
I agree with you yeah I don't think we

765
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,080
want to we want to create a kind of two

766
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:15,010
classes of citizens and you know to

767
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:19,870
suggest that one of them are bad maybe

768
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm confused here it seems like yes if

769
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,779
the good bit is false and the in

770
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,250
compensation it could not be verified

771
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:31,030
what is the semantics that the

772
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:34,510
certificate is supposed to convey so the

773
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,180
certificate right if convey is certainly

774
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,069
who the parent is

775
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,990
and you know what they're ocn or

776
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:43,808
whatever is Nick conveys what has been

777
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,490
attested as this number range and with

778
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,079
that a connotation you might want to

779
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:52,930
check and make sure that's true if you

780
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:56,920
can which is I agree that's it's not

781
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:58,899
it's not it's not well so let me let me

782
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,779
run this a little harder I can imagine a

783
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,809
case where you're doing a sub delegation

784
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:07,900
from a TN range to another TN range

785
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:09,819
where you just look at it and you'll

786
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,839
know nobody you need to go talk to an

787
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:14,369
industry database to figure that out

788
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:17,319
right then like so I could imagine that

789
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,910
that would not require setting the good

790
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:34,750
bit for you still to be able to trust it

791
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:36,578
in a verifying side yeah the good bit is

792
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,079
not is not relevant to that case I'm

793
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:39,339
just saying it doesn't need to be sad in

794
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,720
order for it the good bit we were

795
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,569
relevant to its parent which is

796
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:54,578
delegating for no C n to the initial TN

797
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:56,619
range right and so right right and it

798
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,059
makes it easier can add to the analytics

799
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,400
and stuff because I think about this

800
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:02,950
what we're doing here is we're building

801
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,589
up information on what we know right so

802
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:08,410
this this is another bit of information

803
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:09,609
that we can add right we're not getting

804
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,288
away from the fact that there you've got

805
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:14,920
to run analytics and stuff to get this

806
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:18,930
right yeah this isn't this isn't as

807
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,930
deterministic as you might want to be

808
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:25,059
like maybe I'm bringing too much of like

809
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:28,960
a traditional authoritative PKI it's

810
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:31,480
sensibility to this but usually you know

811
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,549
what wetting a thority signs a

812
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,650
certificate to an assignment you know

813
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:40,059
with the subordinates information there

814
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:41,710
it is saying that I have verified that

815
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:44,230
this is the case the information and

816
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:48,460
certificate approaches it sounds like

817
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:49,660
what is being here is that perhaps in

818
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,880
any case

819
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:56,379
that statement is being telling it has

820
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:58,720
one of a collection of fairies not as a

821
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,279
single well so so nari is speaking to

822
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,459
how the certificate itself is merely an

823
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:06,099
input to Mississippi validation process

824
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,799
then at the turning side is an input to

825
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:10,599
a broader analytics right that factors

826
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:11,710
and other things then what's in their

827
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:13,119
certificate to make decisions about

828
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,150
whether or not you should alert a user

829
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,930
or plox a call or whatever right and so

830
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,789
I mean I I think your message is coming

831
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,069
through I would probably be content to

832
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:29,980
dispense with the evil bit and just say

833
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:32,980
that are your good bit and like you know

834
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,240
just just have these certs if a CA is

835
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,529
issuing them it should be responsible

836
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,319
for making sure the encompassing

837
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:40,180
semantics have been validated and you

838
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:42,009
know one handy fact as I say here is its

839
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,839
auditable offline right if you've got

840
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:45,089
these certificate repositories and all

841
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,140
these certificates are being stored in

842
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,940
somebody who is responsible for the

843
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,440
oversight of the overall system could

844
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,519
really just go throughout you go through

845
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,130
them like once a day there's not that

846
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,258
many certs right and like just make sure

847
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,789
that actually those encompassing

848
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:59,279
semantics apply there's like all kinds

849
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,690
of things like that to become possible

850
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:03,640
that should hopefully serve the same

851
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:10,509
purpose as a good bit would in this

852
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:12,848
instance yes cus before being able to

853
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:17,680
check two different three different four

854
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:19,480
different ways yep yep we want to be

855
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,058
able to check and validate and verify as

856
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,930
many ways as we can we also want this to

857
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,509
be able to work and give you a

858
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,710
reasonable assurance with as little

859
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:28,650
shenanigans during call set up time as

860
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,759
possible I think it to be a design goal

861
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:32,200
and you know we certainly don't want to

862
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:33,339
close the door and people performing

863
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,660
those checks if they feel that they're

864
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:37,029
necessary in the course of call

865
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,549
processing so last I know you spent a

866
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,779
lot of time in this we do need to talk

867
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:42,670
some more with acme star about

868
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:44,019
delegation and kind of the short term

869
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,240
approaches that they're looking at I

870
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,069
think there may be some overlap and

871
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,229
reuse just in the Acme ecosystem around

872
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:52,420
this which is not so relevant to how the

873
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,670
search themselves are constructed but

874
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,299
just in terms of easy ways to get them

875
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:02,160
and make sure that they stay fresh

876
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:03,390
that's it I think another slide I think

877
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,920
no side doesn't need to be shown but you

878
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:09,890
can show it I think it just says next

879
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:12,810
steps resolve issues continue work

880
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,299
course correction time people think this

881
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,620
on the right track anybody here thinking

882
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,820
these are the wrong questions to be

883
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:33,089
asking they're more fundamental

884
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:38,820
questions other things we're doing we in

885
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:42,060
our IP pbx lab in middletown who does

886
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:45,000
the verification of IP pbx before they

887
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:50,670
connect to our network we talked to them

888
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,960
about delegated certs and unanimously we

889
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:58,080
got an answer back of hell no I've

890
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:02,820
shared this in the IP m9 and I think I

891
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:20,069
said it here several times but that's

892
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:22,740
our yeah I mean the IP x the IP pbx

893
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:26,940
community was actually pulling IP

894
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:31,020
functions into the enterprise okay and

895
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,540
then several years later the phenomena

896
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:37,590
or the pendulum you know shifted the

897
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,720
other way where they were wanting the

898
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:43,140
carrier to do more and more on their

899
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,790
behalf and today particularly with

900
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,220
everything moving to the cloud that's

901
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:50,070
moving further and further from within

902
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:56,120
the enterprise and so you take all of

903
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:58,620
those into into account you know are

904
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,950
feeling you know in you know in talking

905
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:06,240
to the vendors and actually even talking

906
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:08,759
to our customers is that they're they're

907
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,700
not going to be doing things like this I

908
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,520
know for the 18 giv flex free servers

909
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,950
which is our biggest service we actually

910
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,070
in our

911
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:21,129
database and our app server in the

912
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,990
network actually have a list of numbers

913
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:27,010
that our customers are using that are

914
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:30,129
ATT's numbers that the customer is using

915
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:33,060
that come from another carrier and most

916
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:35,410
recently we actually added a feel for

917
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,720
Blackfoot that are were vanity numbers

918
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:40,029
and you know these numbers are numbers

919
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:46,299
that they want to use for the purposes

920
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:51,160
of display purposes so so a ton pack in

921
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:55,180
that one I guess I'd say confusing like

922
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,950
I'm I'm CTO of the largest enterprise

923
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,960
vendor of enterprise PBX is and I know

924
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,460
we want this and we're implementing it

925
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,200
and we want to delegate it so I'm not

926
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,910
let's say i'm sure that the i'm sure

927
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
these i believe everything you're saying

928
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,089
but it seems like there's some

929
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,759
miscommunication between the two of

930
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:15,070
these and i also talked to carriers and

931
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,180
enterprises who want that delegate some

932
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:40,569
make some people may not want to

933
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:48,339
delegate and that's okay well so so let

934
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:49,960
me I know you've heard what you heard I

935
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:51,700
know you've heard it from a Cisco person

936
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,380
but I'm trying to figure out what what

937
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,520
what that is it figured that out because

938
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,660
I think that I think that there is

939
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,710
everything where who said about who is

940
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,810
you say a thing that there's people

941
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:07,270
moving more services to the cloud from

942
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:09,130
veterans does that program from

943
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,319
RingCentral through the cisco all-range

944
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,700
that secretly so that's happening but I

945
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:15,490
think that that's pushing me actually

946
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,439
through this delegation even more and

947
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,578
people are getting it like you said

948
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,130
about people getting numbers a lot

949
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:23,020
places that's happening so I don't know

950
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,240
it seems like we should big we can we

951
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,980
can pull some information

952
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,680
watch these fingers and figure out what

953
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:33,030
the actual is yeah and III just want to

954
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,580
harp on this one point here on

955
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,890
motivation push credentials from teen

956
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,540
odors to an AAS able to sign for the

957
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,430
call that does not mean the enterprise

958
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,200
necessarily and this is something is

959
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,460
very this architecture is not specific

960
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,020
to the notion that the enterprise is

961
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,330
gonna end up being the entity that has

962
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,130
these delegated certs these delegated

963
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,900
certs are there maybe it's a cloud

964
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,020
service maybe it's the outbound carrier

965
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,240
maybe again Martin maybe your service is

966
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,970
gonna get delegated credential from

967
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,399
Verizon to sign for numbers that are for

968
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:05,220
Verizon's customers and you're gonna be

969
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,560
the one using it the thing we want to

970
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,990
get back to again is this thing on the

971
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,790
bottom of you know if what ends up

972
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,140
happening from this is outbound carrier

973
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:15,150
signing even though they don't in the

974
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,319
number with credentials that have no

975
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,250
relationship to the ownership that

976
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,800
number you know I mean my greatest fear

977
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,720
first ur and shaken deployment overall

978
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,820
honestly is just this point because that

979
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,589
this is how we end up right where we

980
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,440
start it in a place because it's great

981
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:34,200
if 18 T does if it's not great if every

982
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,460
carrier can sign for any number that

983
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,629
they think they should be able to sign

984
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,010
for within a a station and I this is

985
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,680
this is a way we could get something

986
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,950
fielded by the end of 2019 or into 2020

987
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,910
that will make people think that stur

988
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:52,140
accomplish nothing and like I just again

989
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,339
other than trace back it doesn't evil

990
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,109
trace back but it certainly didn't able

991
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,150
anything for real-time blocking or for a

992
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,740
real-time processing and that is my

993
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,810
biggest concern about this overall

994
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:06,959
project at the moment and I think we

995
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:10,350
have to get past it Chris the two use

996
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,410
cases that I see most are actually not

997
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:16,650
really the PBX although it can be used

998
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:19,290
by the PBX obviously the two use cases

999
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:22,380
that I see that our most critical at

1000
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,180
least real ear term are VoIP providers

1001
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,119
that don't have direct access to

1002
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,538
telephone numbers and 1's

1003
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:31,700
Ellucian we have wholesale customers

1004
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:35,569
that have directly asked us the question

1005
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:38,990
then are supportive of this work and

1006
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:42,349
then the other one is not really the

1007
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:44,118
enterprise but more like outbound call

1008
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:47,869
centers and things like that where they

1009
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,519
really do want to control what is you

1010
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:51,650
know and this sort of correlates with

1011
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,970
our CD a little bit which we need to get

1012
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,670
to I'm sure usually that all our time

1013
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:58,069
they're where they want to control you

1014
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,369
know how they want to assign the call

1015
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:02,900
they want to sign what's being shown to

1016
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:04,670
the customer and they want to be able to

1017
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,279
control the experience for the customer

1018
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:09,589
so I think those are the sort of the two

1019
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:15,740
top of mind things from our perspective

1020
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:17,900
part of our most important here yes Eric

1021
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:21,410
Kruger I would offer the last two

1022
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,650
statements are dead wrong dead incorrect

1023
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:31,220
and delegated Sturtz could make things

1024
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:33,920
better right how what could make things

1025
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,109
better but I would say it is saying that

1026
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,480
allowing like when 18th years were

1027
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:41,119
saying I'm going to give a attestation

1028
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,799
to fidelity that is enough for real-time

1029
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,910
authorization blockade it's enough for

1030
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:49,569
penalizing them if they're lying it's

1031
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:53,180
enough for finding the bad guys so

1032
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:55,369
making statements that you know 18 P is

1033
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:57,259
going to break of course I didn't say

1034
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:59,569
that I said it's great if AT&T does it

1035
00:47:57,259 --> 00:48:02,119
for fidelity it's not so great if some

1036
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:05,029
other carriers who have different

1037
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:07,099
policies but you know again we have a we

1038
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:09,289
have a goose and gander problem in this

1039
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:10,789
and like if you're just saying about if

1040
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:12,799
what do I need to do to sign from a

1041
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,599
goose perspective I I don't want to have

1042
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,329
to do a lot of I just want to sign

1043
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,920
things is very simple the problem is the

1044
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:21,349
verification side of that once this gets

1045
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:28,489
to the gander is where this could really

1046
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:30,380
if this could tank this entire effort no

1047
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,789
well I mean it the attestation of those

1048
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,930
are a factor but I'm just much more

1049
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:34,279
concerned about the fact there is a

1050
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,049
class of carriers before any of this

1051
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:38,720
forsaken stuff came along right who

1052
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:40,640
apparently are willing to you

1053
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,399
send numbers calling party numbers out

1054
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,930
into the telephone network that are not

1055
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,369
legitimate that are responsible for all

1056
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,899
the impersonation all the voicemail

1057
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:50,180
hacking all the Robo calling stuff that

1058
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,430
we've talked about here and I see no

1059
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,899
reason why if we open the door - hey

1060
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,578
it's okay for carries a sign for

1061
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,170
whatever number they want if it's even

1062
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:59,240
if we do that with the best intention of

1063
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:02,200
having a set of carriers who are very

1064
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,950
reliable like have an easy life the

1065
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,680
unfortunate consequence of that if

1066
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:08,060
that's the policy of the network is that

1067
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,649
it is not going to change the fact that

1068
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,660
these actors who have not been as

1069
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:14,420
responsible in the past are going to

1070
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,339
leverage that to continue to impersonate

1071
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:22,369
except now it will be with stir shaken

1072
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:24,619
and we've accomplished nothing in terms

1073
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:30,980
yes three months later there will be

1074
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:32,390
there will be a problem about them well

1075
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,290
so I mean I think the real thing I'm

1076
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:35,299
trying to say there is that real-time

1077
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:36,740
blocking an authorization have changed

1078
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:43,250
the story a bit from where we were when

1079
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:44,810
shaken well I think attestation is kind

1080
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,339
of orthogonal to this yeah but the point

1081
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,680
is you need the information in real time

1082
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:51,170
if you're going to do real-time blocking

1083
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:55,359
and trace back is has a different

1084
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:57,560
purpose than real time blocking does I

1085
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:05,420
don't see the word a out of the station

1086
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:07,400
on here but I mean so again because if

1087
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,230
you're if the principle you're willing

1088
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,030
to accept is okay this was signed for by

1089
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,200
a carrier someone who NECA is willing to

1090
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:21,650
give these things - and there's there's

1091
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:24,560
a long line developing as well I said

1092
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:30,670
start right I said this is a good start

1093
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:37,009
and that's not a trace back okay okay

1094
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:39,020
it's a real time after trace back that's

1095
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:45,349
there's a long line I know we're not

1096
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:50,089
even have time for our CD that will tell

1097
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:52,460
me who the bad guy carries for tip but

1098
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:56,810
like someone's gotta get on that

1099
00:50:52,460 --> 00:51:02,060
if they can be subject and that is based

1100
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:04,940
on a pattern of bad behavior yes control

1101
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,190
of the assets upfront and someone can't

1102
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,390
sign something they go home then you

1103
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:14,869
never arrives

1104
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:17,000
yes it makes even better yes good start

1105
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:35,050
yeah good start does not mean doesn't

1106
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:38,630
work thirty seconds come on hurry

1107
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:44,630
question yes so in a lot of other

1108
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:46,339
carriers situations where we have

1109
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:49,580
similar situations one of the principal

1110
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:51,109
issues is that it is relatively easy for

1111
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,900
somebody who wishes to behave as a

1112
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:57,080
cantor to mint a new identity and become

1113
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,520
a gambler over and over again with new

1114
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:02,080
identity yep

1115
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,190
this occurs in spam and occurs yes

1116
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:09,310
impersonation curve it occurs other

1117
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:09,310
places my question to you is is this

1118
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:17,960
question he's asking how Necco works and

1119
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:20,330
how you get OC ends is there a way for

1120
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,940
somebody who has previously been given

1121
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:26,779
an OC n which has ended up on this list

1122
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:30,980
to be traced to future applications to

1123
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:33,500
the same Authority or not because answer

1124
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,810
to that is no than what you're doing is

1125
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:39,020
setting up a periodicity that's related

1126
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:41,420
I got it yeah which isn't which isn't

1127
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,730
terribly quickly but that much said

1128
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,440
there are a lot of them out there and so

1129
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,790
you you know there's some people may

1130
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,099
have opportunity to cycle through them

1131
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,080
rapidly but it's a relatively

1132
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,970
constrained resource they're relatively

1133
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,200
difficult to get I imagine there could

1134
00:52:52,970 --> 00:53:03,560
be analytics I could let you make

1135
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:05,109
correlations but it's tricky in this

1136
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,820
case in this

1137
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:13,000
shaking in case yeah because the ocean

1138
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:14,800
is relatively the threat model really

1139
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,280
shouldn't be people minting new

1140
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:24,720
identities freely but whether the burden

1141
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:28,090
of creating a new seat OCN is met by the

1142
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,060
kind of financial gain of being willing

1143
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:33,910
to be the originator of this this sort

1144
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:37,470
of traffic yes and I think if that's the

1145
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:39,970
question you're asking there there's a

1146
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:41,020
there's an analysis we could do to

1147
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,600
figure out where that break point

1148
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:47,020
instead yeah that that turns it into

1149
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,610
whether or not the the better situation

1150
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,230
where you never have to go through this

1151
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:53,680
this fifteen minutes already you never

1152
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:57,120
have to look for this OCN look look up

1153
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,100
at all as part of this is it's worth the

1154
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,600
the additional effort and money that

1155
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,150
will go in to enable in these other

1156
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,160
distances because I think that it's

1157
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:08,380
quite clear from from your answer that

1158
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,970
there is a risk here it's on the same

1159
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,190
risk as we see in environments where

1160
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:14,649
they're freely meant identities but it's

1161
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:17,440
also not clear how that that risk and

1162
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:19,120
reward will match once this is very

1163
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,440
common in its in and there's further

1164
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,720
wrinkles in this like if you're using

1165
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,310
like pseudo OC ends like SPC's that are

1166
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,509
not quite us yen's those could have very

1167
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,950
different properties in terms of how

1168
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,540
could they acquire them and how quickly

1169
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,950
they can be correlated and so you know

1170
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,600
there's there's a lot of edges in this

1171
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:32,770
we'd need to analyze but I I really was

1172
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,060
not trying to pick too much of a fight

1173
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,800
with this and I apologize that those

1174
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:42,279
were like kind of divisive the way that

1175
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:45,460
I put that there it's not gonna be worth

1176
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:52,780
their ever but but if it's a pseudo ocn

1177
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:54,580
right that's that's a different depends

1178
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:59,070
on how those are issued but yeah see if

1179
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:59,069
it requires the PAS you them then yeah

1180
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:07,330
sure and we've we've used like all of

1181
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:10,600
stirrers time on this one document we

1182
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:13,529
are we are Chris do you want to speak

1183
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,529
about our CD for five minutes

1184
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:20,050
virtual interim

1185
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:22,450
the early part of September I'll send a

1186
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:24,480
note sorry to get a photo for you can we

1187
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:36,640
can

1188
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:38,860
okay okay well thank thanks for coming

1189
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,270
and I think we need to have this

1190
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,610
discussion so it's a good discussion and

1191
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:45,600
I think we have at least some points

1192
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,600
where we will go

1193
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,079
