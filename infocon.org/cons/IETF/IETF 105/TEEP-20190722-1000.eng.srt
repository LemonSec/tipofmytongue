00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:21,930
all right we're gonna get started

4
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,429
welcome to the working group this is the

5
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,350
first meeting of the week and so we want

6
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,119
to call special attention to the note

7
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,220
well we'll leave this on the screen for

8
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,539
a minute or so here make sure that you

9
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,548
read the note well it covers all the

10
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:40,320
meetings during the week as part of the

11
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,909
IETF I kept out of here actually how

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,758
many people is this their very first

13
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,100
teeth meeting your hand the very first

14
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,369
one excellent thank you welcome we're

15
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,369
glad you're here thank you for coming

16
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:57,180
all right for note takers I believe we

17
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,670
have one note-taker right now Thank You

18
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,590
Ned Smith it would be helpful to have a

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,570
second note-taker as it back up

20
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,210
we keep notes in the ether pad which is

21
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,340
the bottom link there you should be

22
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,709
aware of and if you go to the I you just

23
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,530
learned this the IETF agenda page has a

24
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,000
link that takes you to notes that when

25
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,290
generated a different link than this one

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,860
so we're using the one that's on this

27
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,030
slide I make sure you use this one when

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,410
is there a person that'd be willing to

29
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,410
be a backup note-taker for us

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:37,180
it was the charitable watch anything we

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,460
do have Medeco we will be watching the

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,370
jeffer and I think we have somebody else

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,600
watching Jeff are too okay

34
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,430
is there anybody else who wants to watch

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,350
ever we didn't have a screen okay I

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:53,230
think you been okay great

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:55,150
alright here's our agenda for today and

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,470
I will mention in case you didn't get

39
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,710
the notice it's been widely broadcast

40
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,550
our Friday session is moved to tomorrow

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,920
morning

42
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,770
hey that means we have plenty of time

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,440
and so today our focus is on the

44
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,320
architecture document issues and these

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,890
are just guesses on the time here the

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,780
time is flexible and that if we run long

47
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,019
that's perfectly fine we have the time

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,150
and the item number for the transport

49
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,380
discussion will move to tomorrow if we

50
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,080
need more time for architecture

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:30,160
discussion today this is our current

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,890
agenda for today this is the agenda for

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,750
tomorrow morning same time we're in a

54
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,829
different room at same time tomorrow and

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,350
so tomorrow we get into protocol and the

56
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,180
starting at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow we will

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,250
have the discussion about attestation

58
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,470
and the relationship with the rats

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,209
working group okay there are some rats

60
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,950
participants that we want to be in that

61
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,570
discussion and they have a conflict

62
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,700
during the first hour and so all the

63
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,250
attestation stuff will start at 11:00

64
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,079
and so as you'll see right now we are

65
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,400
all puns are just estimates but you'll

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,110
see before 11:00

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,030
those don't add up to an hour right

68
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,560
which is why the transport destruction

69
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,480
overflowing to tomorrow is perfectly

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,280
fine if we do that right we will be able

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,570
to have time for non Advent station

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,370
related stuff during the first hour

73
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,899
tomorrow and I've had station during the

74
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:20,260
second hour tomorrow okay any agenda

75
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,089
bashing any comments on the agenda

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,370
before we actually begin their agenda

77
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:30,520
here's our agenda for today just look

78
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:32,410
good okay then with that we are going to

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,090
go to our first presentation which

80
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:40,320
either yeah the same engine our cameras

81
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:52,049
pointing so let's move to the

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:52,050
architecture slides okay looks well

83
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,890
here's a my agenda I would talk good to

84
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,310
talk about that - eros once I have an

85
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,460
update

86
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,169
always that go over the issues summer

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:25,000
issue will have a result but I'm not

88
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:29,370
update document that our ghosts I game I

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,970
didn't try again okay I looked at how

90
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:37,180
stock map dead we have a brief document

91
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:42,340
update of three change you know from

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:45,940
table to 2003 meet you I'm still the me

93
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,270
John it's a secret domain is removed

94
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,700
from document as it's not dependents

95
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,330
anymore so you know this has been a

96
00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:01,300
important topic has been discussing last

97
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:04,510
several working group and last few month

98
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,720
and I will have intermittent and from

99
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,880
less ITF would have a resolution and a

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,270
we get agreement so we removed

101
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,780
actually place dependency secondly we

102
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:20,260
had tip agent in T as an entity model

103
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,690
its insight II there was some

104
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,820
terminology collective occasion what

105
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,640
means agent what it means broker and so

106
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,530
on so that tip a dad I have a some more

107
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,800
slide won't slide each for each of his

108
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,830
changes briefly summer there and T

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,440
broker and tip agent and agent was more

110
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:44,140
aligned I clarified in a document update

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:48,080
in addition to this changes we had a

112
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:51,710
interim meeting in May 17th

113
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,030
and no ideas also have a working session

114
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:58,400
so we worked blocked in that day and we

115
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,289
work through several important topics

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,719
now it has some update on that next No

117
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:11,539
so here quick glimpse of the issues

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:17,090
totally current listed sixty-four issues

119
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:20,870
for architecture before IETF 104 we

120
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:28,460
closed Italian issues resolved and in

121
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:31,310
last three month we we closer to four

122
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,400
and this is three are ready to be closed

123
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,840
which as a after review here what you

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,090
could have closed it ever consider

125
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:47,750
there's no more issue and then they have

126
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,669
this is the other issues this blank

127
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,490
phone is something I will go through

128
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,830
have some updates these are other issues

129
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,870
are we're continuing to work on someone

130
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,508
we have not made update or have not

131
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:04,029
discussed much but like this one so

132
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:09,050
editorial changes this should be not I

133
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:11,779
complicate the the complex ones or major

134
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,060
ones would briefly touch on bound today

135
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:18,159
and we give some discussion I like to

136
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:22,159
get a feedback also that's a man in Asia

137
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:24,440
so next I'll could to throw this one for

138
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:28,430
the interim interim meeting and a

139
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:31,460
working session update we hosted this in

140
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:34,279
May 17th at a somatic office we have

141
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,169
which a medium part an hour they have a

142
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,198
working session by a teacher and the

143
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,198
chairs First Avenue Nestle are there

144
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,739
issues with discussed and there was some

145
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,260
solution proposed for the issues or

146
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,870
problems there's a list here relate to

147
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,880
architecture there's some also our

148
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,100
product discussion to not lives here but

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,630
it is more ready to architecture first

150
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,980
when we talk about secret domain what

151
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,620
follows that do we remove us

152
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,410
to wait more need more feedback so it

153
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,020
discover secret domain tea page ancient

154
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,120
architecture terminology alignment this

155
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,329
was not email straight actually after

156
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,200
the working session formula the working

157
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:22,530
staging was okay not what we call it we

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,250
mainly spend time whiteboard in the end

159
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:28,410
to in the flow then look at where's a

160
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,360
protocol gap with octet gap what the

161
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,209
interactions would to have complete

162
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,490
coverage also face-to-face brainstorming

163
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,230
so what's the API we should put there

164
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:42,450
and adversely we're actually quite a

165
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:45,090
useful exercise we discuss this ta

166
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:49,020
distribution pipeline app remember

167
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:52,230
earlier we have a issue set thi PT

168
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:56,069
tribute part-time or by client app but

169
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,290
when the client app hard it should be

170
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,880
done and we want afford it and have a

171
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,550
worker flow I will talk about here

172
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,320
attitude it's a good example which

173
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:10,229
illustrates the interaction support

174
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:13,770
components we also discuss a topic about

175
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,850
the end-to-end security between sever

176
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,010
provide MTE

177
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:22,590
being a service provider went deliver

178
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:26,220
some trust application or special IP

179
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,670
protected awkward zone to in Tierra is

180
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,440
there's a private concern is there are P

181
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,540
disclosure course on how to address that

182
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,540
so I heard some slide on that one

183
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:44,069
the next I could so this topic first

184
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:48,390
thank you sorry issues issues first one

185
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:50,270
this one says I mean Fe the people in

186
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:55,050
particular for first time come here

187
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:58,500
early draft has been assuming there is a

188
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,630
secret domain for trust application you

189
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,360
install SAS application into a trust

190
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,870
only into a secure domain that was the

191
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,360
inheritor form global platform concept I

192
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,530
have secured Thomas partly ASIC element

193
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,540
but when a pro to prote easy now say is

194
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,510
secret or may require

195
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,699
and Hannah said earlier this issue's

196
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,790
that what's action meaning that what a

197
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,960
secret to me used for its oscillation

198
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:30,180
scheme it's a it's a management scheme

199
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,910
or its user for provisioning so what's

200
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,300
the purpose but it will have as GX and

201
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,199
different teas is that required is that

202
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,439
necessary

203
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,290
so the consists of feedback combines and

204
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,850
no adronis we're gonna see it has to be

205
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:54,000
a requirement for trust application in

206
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:56,820
broad t different T kinds so what we

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,020
decided was said tip doesn't need to

208
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,780
expose secret domain api's anymore so

209
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,750
set aside we just have a trust

210
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:10,020
application management however however

211
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:13,830
we'll leave that to implementation so if

212
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,689
a t like a logo for TZ want to use such

213
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,010
secret domain on the coverage fine they

214
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:22,650
can implement T per protocol and ta

215
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,740
management API like it you start here on

216
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,590
account they can assign implicit secret

217
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,240
to me identify whatever they decide but

218
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,120
for protocol level we would not

219
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,830
interpret it would not assume there's

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,830
such thing right it's a implement

221
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:40,140
dependent but for other T's and never

222
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,900
have concept it continually just mad it

223
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,850
here yeah so that's an important

224
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,680
decision I think this will be one of the

225
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,320
major decision in architectural I will

226
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,689
our concealer because avert pick a

227
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,800
change alright big change we removed

228
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:57,450
half of ap ice for the coffee Kyle and

229
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,920
also remove a lot of key management I'd

230
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,260
never say early there was a model

231
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,839
Ultherapy management that was it

232
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,050
now you have a key social security oh

233
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:11,490
man secret no me sheriff ISP owned by SB

234
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:14,719
who said so that complexity so status

235
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,310
wise architecture document has updated

236
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,650
to remove the secret domain has made

237
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,189
pieces but this is somewhere we may have

238
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:27,000
a word with her not fully removed but at

239
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,860
this is product apartment also Hannah's

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,350
we're talking

241
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,500
tomorrow and abortion which didn't make

242
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:38,839
my change but it wasn't to researchers a

243
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:41,750
pneumo HD and the protocol is a schema

244
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,120
relating luleå circuit domain is a

245
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,540
first-class City that right have

246
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:54,519
identifier name key and saw in schema

247
00:13:47,540 --> 00:14:00,079
this now become yeah so this is so any

248
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:02,360
have comment or update this is an issue

249
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,839
that we believe we had consensus for at

250
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,300
last

251
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,860
IETF and now you're just reporting the

252
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,410
action has been done in the architecture

253
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,670
document and so I think the editors feel

254
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,819
that this issue is not ready to be

255
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:18,040
closed yes yes he's just Sarah

256
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:20,810
that's a pretty close to all right okay

257
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,519
yes yes yes

258
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:27,729
hello straight doc Amanda has been damn

259
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:31,370
yeah so next one this is a very simple

260
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,649
is he introduced and there's a thank

261
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,560
safe and a lot of good feedback come

262
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:38,870
back there terminal earlier I mean you

263
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,149
know we're beginning we have that I was

264
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,579
a very old time okay first draft is

265
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:47,779
arrived at an agent without EAP agent

266
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:52,279
cheap agent now a clarify to say we have

267
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:54,529
a tip a broker you know are in rich Ward

268
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,310
because need a handle transport layer

269
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,490
righty

270
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:04,250
Anaheim network capability so you need

271
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:07,339
something in the e to do that job then

272
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:12,110
this are you need property that we need

273
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:15,740
something inside t to handle the tip

274
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,829
protocol so is that such concept and

275
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,040
this is a formally formulated district

276
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:24,829
we caught tip agent so now we do have a

277
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,540
architecture component cut tip agent in

278
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:33,079
society which would text their messages

279
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,959
from tip a broker so this now's

280
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,870
introducing architects talk I to a

281
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:40,459
propagate to the product document and

282
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,650
transport document

283
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,440
tell me not as a white I have next one

284
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,060
so on it's in a zero straight document

285
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,310
this to issue you can see the early

286
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,530
there was a to a couple you should

287
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,780
relate to this no matter what you call

288
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,819
agent you could broker what when you

289
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:01,339
call an agent when talk agent now it

290
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,410
means it a entity inside RT a has

291
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,150
implemented is implemented dependent

292
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,969
whether it's a trusted Application

293
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,740
Specialist application self maybe maybe

294
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,620
special system trust applique

295
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:17,120
application or maybe not dependent ee

296
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:23,890
yeah but it is a component conceptually

297
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:27,290
reprint that so this one next on folder

298
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:30,830
you can see it'll get better so now you

299
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,819
have clone aside to my side you have TP

300
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:37,900
broker you know

301
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:42,920
reee which handles networking to remote

302
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:45,560
service talk with a local tea in a

303
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,699
device so you have tip agent Harper

304
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:52,459
Philippian Tam site Sam sighs this is a

305
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:56,540
created to the depth allure Israel have

306
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:59,000
very hot tam-tam may run all senti went

307
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,990
on the riccati I better say you may

308
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,329
highways Jack you have also TV and you

309
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,490
have component it web server we know

310
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,089
HTTP protocol you will have on the web a

311
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,920
server do we need to formulate some

312
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:16,250
conceptual module there we come given

313
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,709
name yeah question comebacks they say is

314
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,069
named Tammy we call this time prokhor

315
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,200
but it's broken right word at a let me

316
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,129
change later for this is like your

317
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,190
feedback yeah

318
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,680
so so far and say do we may call this

319
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:35,570
temp rocker symmetric to this you have

320
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:37,880
agency a broker and then this time a

321
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,470
service side will have this time engine

322
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,080
right imagine when the engine like this

323
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,630
and then you have a web tier or

324
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,929
transport level 8 horas para autonomy is

325
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,990
necessary HTTP temporal car so that's

326
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,990
that from architect Stockman my question

327
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:56,149
more come West so shall we

328
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,490
this entity into the architecture

329
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:03,830
diagram into the architectural document

330
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:06,110
and Dave tomorrow today I can later he

331
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,090
may have a new one more in a different

332
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,330
stack talk about this awful product

333
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:15,709
document definite will be must missions

334
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:17,449
then to a pushback as a measure for the

335
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,570
current document we need a formula that

336
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,820
right if he introduced about that we

337
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,129
just a temp service with talk West madam

338
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,770
service it won't pass by it's a black

339
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:33,049
box from moment with the final message

340
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:35,990
protocol so this up to discussion now

341
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:39,500
we're thinking okay but definitely I

342
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,929
think question until we get to the

343
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,899
transport discussion because I'm gonna

344
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:47,600
expand that question to a different

345
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:51,219
question any more questions that are

346
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,449
interrelated MIDI voice I'm good a flat

347
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,309
reserved judgment and this one answered

348
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,450
this one after entering the caption so

349
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,908
that will come up in the transport

350
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,590
discussion so okay so Miss equation so

351
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:03,289
now it's a morph of architecture side

352
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,480
where the promote into the architecture

353
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,129
level I think that's a descent equation

354
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,419
here but we may call Appa would win that

355
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:15,799
brain op and then the next one about

356
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:19,659
that protocol a landscape I was a

357
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:22,580
protocol landscape we started with

358
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:26,029
architect document they were started

359
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:29,149
with the protocol say May protocol is a

360
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:32,899
message the protocol you have a message

361
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:35,479
exchange between te and the Tam right to

362
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:38,029
manage your trust application install

363
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,450
just installed here DVT a Manticore

364
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:44,649
status but long this then we introduce

365
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:48,940
architect component will have to broker

366
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:51,350
and tip agent how to talk each other

367
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,640
interoperability right then when they

368
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:58,428
need API I call this tip agent API will

369
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,470
have its definition in ot IP protocol

370
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:03,470
okay in that protocol

371
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,350
now the question says this one where

372
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,580
should be defined

373
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,770
we editors

374
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,040
discussions and we may define this an

375
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,050
architecture talk nothing in a porn talk

376
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,590
or transport talk that one way because

377
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:22,010
this can be sheer no matter what

378
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:25,699
protocol define in this message but it

379
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:29,960
isn't just that between retort and which

380
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,420
ye and the TE that's a same API we meet

381
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,630
to that that's a one proposal guide but

382
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,210
here th and this 80-85 chat support

383
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:41,600
protocol they were have I've see already

384
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:45,650
for that one right supportive on HTTP

385
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,399
the first one requires three four Peter

386
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:52,580
client app talkative a broker or a

387
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:56,030
summer installer T installed in IE to

388
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:59,720
trigger some installed ta do we need to

389
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:03,139
define P and not so far as I know we

390
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,050
leave that on say how that an int active

391
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,420
broker may be platform dependent right

392
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:11,750
plan for depend on whether the IOT

393
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,200
device or Android or HDX how that done

394
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,900
we may not be able to define that it's

395
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,470
outside of our control so I said no this

396
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,660
is only intention and no definition here

397
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,510
the another side if we introduced am

398
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:30,140
broken savvy at am this also link here

399
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:32,510
do we need to formulate some API or this

400
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,520
only has one black box

401
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,430
they just defined here they have a D

402
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,620
intercept the API is called here this

403
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:43,850
will be risk for API assumed lies any

404
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,830
practice this only internally send to it

405
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,590
process message similar to this site

406
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:53,000
right API call there's a process the

407
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:55,459
message was a simple JSON whatever so so

408
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,850
far we just consider one two three the

409
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:08,420
we would define a protocol for snow five

410
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:15,679
TBD on top that so we may have fall off

411
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:18,980
these like that one editor of the

412
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,220
transport protocol document so I'm

413
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,370
standing over there

414
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,760
my current opinion on your question

415
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,739
about the weather if the API is are in

416
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,270
here obviously the line is in here at

417
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,590
the line is already in the document

418
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,530
right now I think our question is how

419
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,510
much detail you go a view about what the

420
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,340
api's are that are expressed in that

421
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,260
line or as a just some general statement

422
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,459
about these API is allow you to

423
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,850
communicate between the two and pass

424
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,280
messages that sort of thing and so right

425
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,780
now my opinion that expressed is that I

426
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,750
think the level of depth that you go

427
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,590
into should be the same between at two

428
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,470
and five

429
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,340
I don't have any opinion on the amount

430
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,680
of depth that belongs in the

431
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,780
architecture document as to whether it's

432
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,120
very hand wavy or whether it is a list

433
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,129
of the names of the api's I have no

434
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,689
preference there but I think whatever

435
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,650
the answer is for two I would prefer

436
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:30,090
that the answer should be the same for

437
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:33,090
five so sorry I wish that my opinion is

438
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:36,720
that the one inside probably is needed

439
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:39,209
at least from what I understand for some

440
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,760
use cases the other on the right it's

441
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,140
kind of internal in my opinion it's that

442
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,490
they shouldn't be linked together

443
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,710
I don't think that if that one is

444
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:50,400
included that one should I don't think

445
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,520
so I think two is to stay on five I have

446
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,640
no okay so quick for the note takers

447
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,460
yeah not your name sorry for these them

448
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:05,760
okay so alert you're talking about

449
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:11,160
interfaces five five unplugs I think two

450
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,720
is important I and fine okay it's it

451
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,180
could be good but I don't think it is

452
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,990
because it's one service sleeping early

453
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:21,600
so we care will be a officer inside the

454
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:26,270
module somehow that's my opinion

455
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,270
hmm thank you darling

456
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:36,750
this is Dave wheeler I like the symmetry

457
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:44,820
between adding 2 & 5 I think it's

458
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:50,010
important to define them both I agree

459
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:51,510
with the last the last person it's sore

460
00:24:50,010 --> 00:25:01,830
in this sermon

461
00:24:51,510 --> 00:25:05,580
sorry that's hard for my ears but I the

462
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:09,750
the question in my mind is whether the

463
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:12,629
api's are normative or not um clearly

464
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,809
you know we could get away with saying 5

465
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:19,200
is not normative mm-hmm I think it's

466
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:21,600
harder to say that 2 is not normative

467
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,809
because you need to have the

468
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:29,309
interoperability between software and

469
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:32,820
tes when we say 2 is normative then I

470
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:34,980
have a hard time saying 5 isn't for the

471
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,860
same for the same reason it creates a

472
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,150
lack of symmetry in the protocol and in

473
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:44,820
the architecture and I think that's

474
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:47,610
difficult so I understand the desire to

475
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,158
not be normative in the tam side to

476
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:54,870
allow for more flexibility I don't think

477
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:57,659
it it hurts much too to have it be the

478
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,479
same as as number 2 so I'm leaning

479
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:03,450
towards saying both 2 and 5 should be

480
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,309
defined and they should be normative but

481
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,580
I'm open to having that discussion I

482
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:13,110
understand the concern of defining too

483
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,820
much I'm jumping in line this is Dave

484
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,600
Taylor go ahead and get in line you're

485
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:24,720
in line it for me I didn't want to run

486
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:27,330
through me okay the purpose potentially

487
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,480
of having the names this is in of the

488
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,389
api's in there is the names of api's is

489
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,740
what is used to correlate behavior in

490
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:40,620
the message protocol spec number one and

491
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,850
the line number one and behavior and the

492
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,399
transport protocols

493
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,800
line number three right if you use the

494
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,350
same name for something which says I

495
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,850
invoke this event and one says I react

496
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,770
to the following behavior in response to

497
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,300
this event right then you can correlate

498
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,930
information the two specs they fit

499
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:02,850
together okay and so line number two is

500
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:06,540
a way of doing that for the TE device

501
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,879
side of both specs okay line number five

502
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,090
is a way to coordinate between those two

503
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,220
sides of the Pam side of those two specs

504
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,600
right so that is would be the benefit of

505
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,460
having the literal names in there is

506
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,379
just to say if there was an update of

507
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,090
either of those specs for some

508
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,890
alternative specs so let's say an

509
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,320
alternative transport spec was defined

510
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,760
it was not HTTP right someone who's

511
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,189
going to do a different transport spec

512
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,170
they would say if they were normative in

513
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,480
there as David suggested we were

514
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,670
suggesting then a new transport spec

515
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,200
that was a non HTTP would say and here's

516
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:41,820
the names I have to specify the behavior

517
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,440
for right that would be a requirement if

518
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,909
you made it be normative right that's

519
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,260
just my response to Dave saying he likes

520
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,660
it being normative I said I personally

521
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,570
have no opinion either way but if you do

522
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,110
that that would be a benefit yeah I'll

523
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,210
help

524
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:59,490
oh sorry sorry annoyed Michigan it sorry

525
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,370
furbish again I don't have a strong

526
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,590
opinion like like you Dave but I'm

527
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,620
thinking of the case when I have

528
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,350
multiple thumbs and I'm kind of not sure

529
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,620
that is the same so I don't know if it's

530
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,570
important to have the separation inside

531
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,709
each of the thumbs or not that's what

532
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,899
I'm a little not not clear so for this

533
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,240
implication one time maybe it's okay to

534
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,420
separate and have both but for multiple

535
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,490
I don't know maybe it should be

536
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:35,100
normative for that case I don't I don't

537
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:37,740
have opinion but that's okay so okay so

538
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,860
from an architecture perspective I do

539
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:44,610
think it's important to describe the

540
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:48,510
functional workflow when you guys speak

541
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:50,550
to normative versus informative that

542
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,850
gets to the question of what does the

543
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:56,490
working group move forward towards

544
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,659
definition and so I want to make sure

545
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,110
that we're clear

546
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:04,170
and I'll have our area director chime in

547
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:07,709
to tell me if I'm wrong Clara in the

548
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:10,170
IETF we talked about the interfaces and

549
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,920
so the data structures and the schema to

550
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:16,500
allow these interfaces to relay

551
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,830
information and so you could define

552
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:24,050
transfer protocols or transport

553
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:27,149
protocols hmm I'm not sure here whether

554
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:31,700
number two and number five would really

555
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:35,880
be in scope for us here in the IETF I

556
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,850
will be open to suggestions of how it

557
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:44,100
could be in scope right now the way I'm

558
00:29:38,850 --> 00:30:01,770
looking at it to me it's not even - it's

559
00:29:44,100 --> 00:30:06,379
not even - may not be in our scope so

560
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:10,680
again the architecture spec to me

561
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:12,870
describes of workflow right and so I

562
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,120
guess if you're trying to ask that so

563
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,110
the question was can it at least be

564
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,239
informative

565
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,729
right and so from an architecture

566
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,770
perspective I guess I'm not making a

567
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,040
distinction of informative versus

568
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:28,470
normative unless you're saying this is a

569
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,710
hard to requirement that has to be in

570
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:37,850
the Charter or teeth and we must define

571
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:37,850
these within teeth does that clarify it

572
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,170
me taco needs to be able to hear you so

573
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm Dave Saylor I'm speaking for the

574
00:30:52,170 --> 00:31:01,340
participant mic from anyway this remote

575
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:05,220
the I think that the API is are in scope

576
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:08,620
I think the various analogies in the

577
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,440
IETF for abstract API switch

578
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,949
are you familiar with that term other

579
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,070
examples in the ATF gssapi as a well

580
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,870
known RFC that was an abstract API the

581
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,260
taps working group this charter to do

582
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,959
various api's and the abstract api's

583
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,309
means that you don't specify how it

584
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,630
looks like in a particular programming

585
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:33,490
language because that can completely

586
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:35,170
vary what you specify is some name for

587
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,400
it that can appear in a document which

588
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,450
may be different than the name that

589
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,410
appears in a particular programming

590
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:43,720
language and the meaning of that API

591
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,250
right without specifying oh and this

592
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,420
thing has to be an integer or something

593
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,720
that's not abstract that would be a

594
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:52,420
concrete API the ITF does those when you

595
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,440
need to correlate behavior between two

596
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,200
different specs like two different

597
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,000
layers like between TCP and the layer

598
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,240
above TCP right says here's a different

599
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,400
event a connection comes in I lost the

600
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,100
connection message arrived things like

601
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,470
that that are events the TCP exposes in

602
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,959
some sense that list of events is an

603
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,970
abstract API that's what I believe is in

604
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,920
scope here that's what the protocol

605
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,960
document and transport protocol document

606
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,790
the T probe message protocol TR PE and

607
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,150
the transport protocol document talked

608
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:24,399
about and I think it's in scope for the

609
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,380
working group but the level of detail

610
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,090
and the architecture document is what I

611
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,330
do not have any strong opinion on as to

612
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:33,629
whether it is that detailed or no detail

613
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:37,990
or anywhere in between

614
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:40,059
so Rindell again my problem with this is

615
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:44,650
let's suppose you remove both two and

616
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:46,899
five right I'm not sure that you can

617
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,929
have all that maybe it's not a direct

618
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:53,320
protocol but it means that the term will

619
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:55,450
talk directly to the tip agent so that's

620
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,260
what I'm a little I don't know that's

621
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,900
correct

622
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,720
so the question is right not tracked at

623
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:07,050
Amtrak to this well goes to this top I

624
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,050
don't think that'll work yeah okay so

625
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,190
benkei ducks oh yeah dave is right we do

626
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,470
have some precedent for talking about

627
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,120
the abstract api's actually we do

628
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,740
specify what they look like in

629
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,889
programming languages in least a couple

630
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:32,230
cases but that's sort of a side note and

631
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:34,630
in terms of in terms of what to do for

632
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,450
the architectures back itself and I sort

633
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:39,370
of agree that maybe it's still unclear

634
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,310
about whether we need to describe things

635
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,110
as you know specific abstract api is or

636
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,060
if we could talk about in more generic

637
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,830
terms this is the sort of information

638
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,710
that you need to convey between these

639
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,090
two islanders not and exactly how you do

640
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,560
that will be to find somewhere else

641
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,250
Naza flee from this working group

642
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:00,399
possibly implementation-specific mm-hmm

643
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:02,830
so I mean we we need to consider what

644
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,160
the architecture looks like in terms of

645
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,250
which pieces are going to interact and

646
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,310
what sorts of things that might be doing

647
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:14,469
and yeah I'm open to having the api's

648
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,870
described I I don't know that there's a

649
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:19,449
clear obvious one way versus the others

650
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:23,310
so I'm excited to hear people you know

651
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:23,310
discussing it and seeing what they think

652
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:41,810
okay yes yeah omerta next yeah and I

653
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,060
have actually later have a one for use

654
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:46,310
case for example illustrate more what's

655
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,529
the api's may be needed

656
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:50,900
oddly the functions I say what kind of a

657
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:54,920
function we may need to disc described

658
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:58,700
and and articulate what center at least

659
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,180
what a way they are and conquer ApS will

660
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,339
define a specific protocol I've talked

661
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,940
about to you feel slightly later and a

662
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:10,520
move up here so next one the talk about

663
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,440
it is actually it's a here just this one

664
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,330
actually so Illustrated is my Moodle

665
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,970
early art okay

666
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:19,940
this will illustrate let's change some

667
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:23,209
kind of functionality involved alright

668
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:26,030
this architecture level but this more

669
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,400
like product costs back but you more

670
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,820
because it's up I want to show the use

671
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,640
case a we discussed when you install ta

672
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:37,400
where the TA partner is a fun note

673
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,879
inside a clan app or maybe in system

674
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,150
already

675
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:45,860
it's another always distributed by Pam

676
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:48,140
and this has major impact on the AP is

677
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,080
API so what functionality you have a

678
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:54,140
support optional require elements are

679
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,920
comments and so on in a first draft

680
00:35:54,140 --> 00:36:01,700
we'll assume T upon is always farm time

681
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,640
from service later we say for like a CH

682
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,490
others that ta partner and not necessary

683
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,710
from time and how to support it and we

684
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,339
get to live in more thought during a

685
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:16,640
working session you know me so the float

686
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,110
looks like this you always start with

687
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,660
client application right client

688
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,970
application has manifest a file it says

689
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,270
there was this way used to refer to suit

690
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,089
as something with to BD it says cannot

691
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:33,050
depend on one ta and this ta can be

692
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:35,660
downloaded from this time URL or not

693
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:39,260
download make contact time URL for

694
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,290
authorization yeah that manifest file

695
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:45,170
and the cloud app will pass this to tip

696
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,210
a broker by the way this can be from an

697
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,250
installer independent platform

698
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,560
not as an application oil meant core

699
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:55,970
applications that call installer I me

700
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,920
that yeah that installer may call TV

701
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,899
broke is a you to that job before me and

702
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,450
wonder that means says you have

703
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,109
something conceptual as a request yet

704
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,890
okay

705
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:09,980
I needed here here's a TS an 20 fire

706
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:12,859
also I say AHA binary not in this case -

707
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,280
he could shoot the steep broker he broke

708
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:19,848
first contact he procured parkways a tip

709
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,650
agent locally is a TA audience thought

710
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:25,010
and even starts that you don't need

711
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:27,619
necessary co-op right but so that the

712
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,660
first thing caught the T tip agent now

713
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:32,510
you need function how to card that first

714
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,609
AP has a request here I'll correct yet

715
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:38,030
whatever you called there's a request

716
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,720
here tip agent inside said is a TA or do

717
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,230
you start

718
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,569
yes no let's assume empty no I don't

719
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,570
know ta they announced for this one with

720
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:50,240
the Tammy URL override a policy card

721
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:53,000
right so spot a cell right say this

722
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,879
could tell me URL but then this one's

723
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,830
whether it has known time earlier that

724
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,560
time already contact me in the past I've

725
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:04,580
trusted time then we make shortcut head

726
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,589
if you never know that time right is it

727
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,140
give me time and name knew that that

728
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,009
says yet right I don't know what it is I

729
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,770
mean atrocity

730
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,140
I will not leak my information what it

731
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,540
does say this one would go back to here

732
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,839
it is here's the time you could contact

733
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:23,050
so call bhakti bhakti broke is now talk

734
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,119
with Tam again now we've got a step

735
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:29,089
first one foot contact what a court my

736
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,700
the first kind of a card any day with

737
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:34,430
the API pass know that wrist for network

738
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,169
pass or name we call it connect there

739
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,299
may be sauce on my initial contact

740
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,910
whether you need is on time come back

741
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,790
says it give me that the last status at

742
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:48,680
same time it's a sign message so that it

743
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:52,550
can tell the sixth tell the tip agent

744
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:56,089
who I am so he can make decision whether

745
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:59,210
are well a lot of temp to to something

746
00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:00,538
in this device and to make that a car

747
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,329
tip broker will

748
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:06,209
has the message camp give it to the

749
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:08,999
agent what a cart well I could generate

750
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:11,219
a name now process T per message right

751
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:14,189
it's just API so look at this our

752
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:16,410
abstract api's if yeah I'm sorry

753
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:17,788
interface how to record that's as a work

754
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,848
no it just discussed

755
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:24,029
so now first once the process is on Cory

756
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:25,619
now this one you says okay I'm a good

757
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:29,239
day and remember this one requesting you

758
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:32,459
start T air outputting as a message

759
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:38,099
correct Co response which they requested

760
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:40,709
ta yes t ID and this one right here is T

761
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,380
planning hash okay by the way this one

762
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:45,569
you have local pond or a and this

763
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,959
generates such message is signed signed

764
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:50,669
by te key and a now send it back send it

765
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:54,089
back to step 8

766
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:58,650
queries funk back and now come come back

767
00:39:54,089 --> 00:40:01,349
say okay this is the Weis I trust and I

768
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,179
would say decide proceed to you start

769
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:06,329
yeah it's sending you start here command

770
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:08,880
you know this tier command it doesn't

771
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:10,559
need to give that ta Pinery right blop

772
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,650
because he upon your locally available

773
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,599
but what one thing does was I was gonna

774
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,839
mention that one we talk about is flow

775
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,299
message ta Panerai while we send it over

776
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:25,078
we get tears there either version or

777
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:27,059
pond or a locally quanta ponder it I may

778
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,039
say you have old version or you have

779
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:32,640
pond route don't trust so you give a

780
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:35,219
tear hash that hash or some of whatever

781
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,689
on telefónica or some data you could

782
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:42,179
tell the panel rate data about a TA so

783
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:43,949
Tim can make a policy decision it can

784
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:45,900
make have a later version ta partner I

785
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:48,119
said isn't watching you should be is not

786
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,969
the one you already released right

787
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,369
because you may have a lot older version

788
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:55,799
locally the latest version may be in

789
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,459
cloud and that's the intention so you

790
00:40:55,799 --> 00:41:00,140
say so

791
00:40:56,459 --> 00:41:03,419
just workflow why's this come back now

792
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:07,499
you can install one thing I wanna point

793
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:09,719
out here is the API so now see now you

794
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:12,419
have an install command is a T per

795
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:14,520
message that was signed and encrypted

796
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:18,359
but over enemy secret ways

797
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:21,930
a mermaid City and kept the piety Tiki

798
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,690
here so that machine encrypted keep a

799
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:26,940
poker in bikinis that Tommy broker right

800
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,880
all the network transport you sure you

801
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,180
came data for to tip agent in this case

802
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:36,720
it doesn't more than that you can tell

803
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,049
what they need does is need to do is put

804
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,240
it in story a message process plus

805
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,890
optional ta partner that itself but is

806
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,419
that a piece of outside of a time

807
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:48,029
remember it's a other side a sign a

808
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,450
message it is a form ie

809
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,260
not a from a sign amazing for time it's

810
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,049
locally here

811
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,960
well it's sign T upon resigns anyway ta

812
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,540
partner is signed by who by the similar

813
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,520
provider not necessary for town all

814
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,290
right forget who she deliver author

815
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,480
right who's the developer applicant

816
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:09,029
develop a silver provider sign up our

817
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,490
silver provider actually this uh I said

818
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,619
if you talk writing tomorrow I think

819
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,899
this is one part of the sinus sauce or

820
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:20,130
more clarification so interesting if I'm

821
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:22,440
a might be entity to buy the SP SP time

822
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,550
device all have a key and certificates

823
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:31,740
multiple entities rights three time key

824
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:33,540
kawazu key and SP signing key so anyway

825
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,939
so the point is this a function here

826
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:38,910
need a company that key upon is optional

827
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:41,400
and past the agents not tip a journey

828
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:45,420
install a solution it has a binary it

829
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,580
may retrieve a binary form local system

830
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,650
it you may not give to me maybe in a

831
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:54,350
resource location already know I will

832
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:56,970
fish myself so that gives this cut four

833
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:59,580
options different variety and different

834
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,980
usage as you can see we need to handle

835
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,410
when you dress so this will add some

836
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,790
parkour complexity but it looks all

837
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,549
there's a valid case that we need to

838
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:12,090
consider so this was a will have a

839
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:15,210
wireless by the port brainstorming by

840
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:21,440
editors there so this would be a flow

841
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:21,440
any comments

842
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:32,420
for if it wasn't where some tes may need

843
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:35,839
the TA binary in order to install the TA

844
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,880
binary other tes may not right and so I

845
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,339
think in presentations in this working

846
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,140
group I think David wheeler in this sx1

847
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:44,750
explained it s GX is an example of one

848
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,848
that does not need the actual TA binary

849
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,320
at install time it only happens at say

850
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:51,230
load time or whatever you don't need the

851
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,660
actual bits of the thing other T's may

852
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,359
store the actual te e and say protected

853
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,848
storage right and so that's why I mean

854
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,650
says you know if needed by a te e right

855
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:02,089
it's not optional it's in one

856
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,320
implementation it would be there and

857
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:08,599
another implementation it would not be

858
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:12,440
there it depends on the DVD is there a I

859
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:15,530
just did a quick look at a three

860
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,160
Randy Turner with Lana senior is there a

861
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:22,130
use cases have been mentioned about

862
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:26,060
connections between across networks

863
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:28,730
between a agent and something outside of

864
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:33,619
the device basically the multicast

865
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:38,030
applications to multiple agents at the

866
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:40,700
same time or multicast there is a

867
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:45,560
section about IOT in the architecture

868
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:48,859
document and in my industry we have we

869
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:53,000
might want to send down the same thing

870
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:57,200
to thousands of devices doing them one

871
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,020
at a time might be a little much so

872
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,950
that's a new case to me so so far we

873
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:06,500
consuming individual device wanti broker

874
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,930
may be multiple by the IT broker may

875
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,420
have multiple TV agents in the multicast

876
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:14,060
for one device but you say if a won't

877
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:18,200
tip over two hundred thousand Matic as

878
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:20,720
much with devices and I'm we have not

879
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,700
considered yet kind of my smarter baby

880
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,740
but also may start a fire there may be a

881
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:30,140
franchise yeah okay yeah yep but you

882
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,279
Bert you're you brought up a use case I

883
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:37,049
think that was

884
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:38,580
this is honest so far in many of the

885
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,000
discussions we talked about the trends

886
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:44,009
were that they've put together on HTTP

887
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,220
but we didn't discuss and maybe maybe we

888
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:49,850
should in a document this that in some

889
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,580
of those use kids like IOT use cases

890
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:55,589
we're probably not using many kids not

891
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,750
using HTTP as the transport but

892
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,780
something else and they are indeed the

893
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:03,870
popular car here would use sort of a

894
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:07,020
multicast distribution model or at least

895
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:11,700
something that is at the radio link

896
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:13,410
group communication security and and

897
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,089
maybe maybe that would be useful to

898
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,670
describe in the architecture document

899
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,620
even though those protocol mechanisms

900
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,950
already exist and and we are only

901
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,540
talking about transporting the OTR P

902
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:29,040
messages on top of those existing

903
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:31,740
protocols so yet okay value to write

904
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,300
correct I see your suggestion here even

905
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,240
this transport layer is on a motor-car

906
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,280
not here right yeah we talked about this

907
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,319
level right this or may have it go out

908
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,020
to some much cast in step is this on

909
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,180
this one some or none that this one this

910
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:49,670
is more local right yes so the client

911
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:54,690
appetizer is is the device management

912
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:58,800
find out so it's not really like there's

913
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:01,080
only this app and then that damn broke

914
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,610
has also the device management servant

915
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:07,890
so that's the underlying protocol that

916
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:12,420
provides that distribution mechanism and

917
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:14,339
that that exists already has been to try

918
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,750
it out and some people actually deploy

919
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:23,870
that already and so on so in our Charter

920
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:25,920
and our original poster we talked about

921
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:29,100
there are many different ways to

922
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,750
distribute the TA binaries themselves

923
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:34,080
and of course there's many different

924
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:36,870
ways to distribute the client apps and

925
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,310
so example in our car to recover and

926
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:39,810
that architecture document you cover

927
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,070
what happens when it was bundled and

928
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:44,619
what happens when it's not bundled and

929
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,090
in the patent the West version they

930
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:48,820
would put into three or four different

931
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:52,869
cases into the architecture document and

932
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:54,520
so here if we talk about a multicast

933
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:56,800
distribution of say the client

934
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,509
application or multicast distribution of

935
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,750
the TA binary that is bundled with the

936
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:04,570
client application that is orthogonal to

937
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:06,760
the whole use of say o TRP okay because

938
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:09,310
o GRP can work without transporting the

939
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,320
TA binary itself and so to answer the

940
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:13,060
question about multicast if multicast is

941
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,580
done it's just the binary distribution

942
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,220
which is not done inside OTR P then it

943
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:21,390
does not change anything on this slide

944
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:26,589
everything I'm good this line is about

945
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:28,569
you know switch slides about what

946
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,820
happens when you do bundle a teen a

947
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,590
binary into a client app which is one of

948
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,530
a couple of different use cases right

949
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:37,450
and so if the client app was distributed

950
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,970
originally be a multicast and so is the

951
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,160
TA binary in this slide okay the

952
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,109
communication between the teat broker

953
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,240
and the Tam is still unicast but that's

954
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:47,859
about metadata and security keys not

955
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,649
about the distribution of the big binary

956
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:53,410
right and so this slide here is still

957
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,730
fully compatible with multicast because

958
00:48:53,410 --> 00:49:00,399
this is agnostic as to how you actually

959
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:03,910
distribute to the TA by area itself this

960
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,730
is Dave wheeler I think the distribution

961
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:09,700
of the binaries could be multicast but

962
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:14,220
our whole protocol is based on a an

963
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:17,649
attestation from the te e to the Tam so

964
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:20,980
we could talk maybe in the architecture

965
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:23,440
document about decoupling that more

966
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:26,619
directly and using a multicast to push

967
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,109
out a binary to too many and end

968
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:34,060
stations that probably requires us to

969
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:37,299
talk a little bit about opening up a

970
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:40,060
different type of transport right with a

971
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,609
port that's listening on multicast but

972
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,580
in the in the installation write an

973
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:49,270
authorization of a te that still

974
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:52,330
point-to-point from Tam to te e in order

975
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:54,820
to make the attestation work there isn't

976
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:58,980
really a way to do a multicast

977
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:01,870
station so right I'm gonna speak up as a

978
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,030
suit working group chair here I was join

979
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,560
T fancy working group chair and so

980
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,930
tomorrow we'll have a discussion about

981
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,779
the relationship to suit as part of Hana

982
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:13,359
ciseaux TRP presentation the discussion

983
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:16,270
of how you distribute binaries to things

984
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,070
is something that I claim is heavily

985
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,350
related to the suit manifest discussion

986
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,670
and I would invite people who want to

987
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,620
participate in the you know could I

988
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:27,580
multi cast off how would I reference a

989
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,290
by URI ata that is multicast or whatever

990
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,700
is a great discussion to take to the

991
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,290
suit working group but I see my suit

992
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:36,189
co-chair in the back who just sat back

993
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:38,740
down so he's not um so I don't think we

994
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:40,750
actually have to do a lot our neighbor

995
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,580
that I think it's useful to discuss this

996
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,860
topic in the architecture documented

997
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:47,319
that they are indeed other transport and

998
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:49,510
the distribution of the binary may be

999
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,640
done in multiple different ways but I

1000
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,250
don't think it will require us to do a

1001
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,100
new protocol mechanisms because those

1002
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:59,170
exist already and have been used like

1003
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,330
for example we've been using this

1004
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:04,090
distribution mechanism in Laura van and

1005
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:07,600
it's actually it's not using IP in that

1006
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:10,450
case for the distribution and I agree

1007
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,779
with the other notes that Dave will add

1008
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:16,960
it earlier yeah I think that if just the

1009
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,530
tip on our caste chip itself it would be

1010
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,770
simple problem but for the adaptation

1011
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:23,080
hor

1012
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:25,630
it's a into end today the individual

1013
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,730
device you get a multiple castle have a

1014
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:33,490
form of devices they've had different

1015
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:35,110
keys and we cannot do either yeah okay

1016
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:39,129
okay good it's a like that we have

1017
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:42,130
summer ok Coromant okay I will move on

1018
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:45,100
there um basically illustration you can

1019
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:48,780
see hopefully help that this slides over

1020
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:51,190
where the functionalities we need to

1021
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,960
illustrate the architecture and a way to

1022
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:55,210
will go to the product cost

1023
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,870
specifications that's more for that

1024
00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:00,940
purpose summarize what's the status at

1025
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:03,160
issue number 11 is it already updating

1026
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,870
the document there is a report that the

1027
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,540
document will then update to match our

1028
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,368
discussion now this one is which the sky

1029
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,980
will have not opted

1030
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:12,509
document yeah and this was not in any

1031
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,880
document yet I think it is sauce

1032
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:17,700
particularly upon right we do have this

1033
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,150
one actually atomic dust nation which

1034
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:23,848
support T upon and claw nap with into

1035
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:25,710
this level of detail and how an impact

1036
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,720
and what considerations big

1037
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,519
architectural half we talk about a click

1038
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,200
on save up with the requirement right

1039
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:36,538
what part are gonna shoot to do and

1040
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:39,299
other should do okay

1041
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:43,220
yes so good thank you so dimensional

1042
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:46,049
eighteen so look at this a fellow I

1043
00:52:43,220 --> 00:53:03,390
think some product on this is one thing

1044
00:52:46,049 --> 00:53:05,490
here Oh actually about it is on me this

1045
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,160
to issue related to this that there's

1046
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:12,180
this relate to issue about earlier would

1047
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,640
have number nine Tim but installed here

1048
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:18,749
in single pass say we have multiple

1049
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:21,390
girls in his architect did I make it

1050
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:25,499
efficient I don't make each end then I

1051
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:29,249
mean a single pass single pass what this

1052
00:53:25,499 --> 00:53:31,709
progress Ted update we first started

1053
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:33,598
wise like single pass means today you

1054
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,480
need to run trips you always start with

1055
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,239
time Cory what the Vice look like is

1056
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,759
tear there what's there then you start

1057
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,920
here and so on but is that if she

1058
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:47,309
insists can you just a don't to to Ron

1059
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,009
chefs use one run trip right so then it

1060
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:52,559
means you can start with T locally sign

1061
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:55,109
requests and time terms yes go ahead

1062
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,380
compact that one on track so this is two

1063
00:53:55,109 --> 00:54:03,660
issues related related okay now come

1064
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:06,119
back to this on the two issues here this

1065
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:10,680
one needed hiding in a similar way can

1066
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:14,700
we achieve that and we come to this

1067
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,058
conclusion indicator ideally your claw

1068
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,249
nap

1069
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:21,270
t brokered poverty region locally yes

1070
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:23,399
and use sigh first however

1071
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:27,360
you don't want to send your signing

1072
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,220
information out to someone you leak your

1073
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,370
information because you don't know that

1074
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:34,200
time yet that privacy concern okay no

1075
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:37,940
means so you don't support it you send

1076
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:41,430
it not she not right yeah so that's all

1077
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:45,300
yeah yeah okay that's a harvest kind of

1078
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:47,879
a talk by to say really reach REE gave

1079
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:50,010
me URL I would not trust a URL yet

1080
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,290
because I do not know how to timing

1081
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:55,620
information yet then I will not give

1082
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:59,700
anything so that was a sign you could

1083
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:03,210
but or not okay we're not a give a sunny

1084
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,770
information out until I know it is the

1085
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,440
time I could trust

1086
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:10,020
alright so for that reason you can see

1087
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,940
they're here sign I'm not going to give

1088
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,570
it a Sunday the first in step four I

1089
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,700
only give maybe Tommy URL you contact a

1090
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:20,910
five step you do the first contact

1091
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,980
verified contact time time give you some

1092
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:23,700
back time give Asante that give you

1093
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,410
certificate

1094
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:30,899
now you can verify this at mo I trust

1095
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:33,390
after that second time I think protocol

1096
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:36,390
variation remembering on says okay

1097
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:40,259
subtle here second time we install

1098
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:43,500
another two year later the TTP agent can

1099
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:46,530
crash at time certificate here already

1100
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:49,620
contact time once in the past another

1101
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:53,640
time if you can tell me URL come time

1102
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:57,180
identify I can now sigh first you know

1103
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:01,470
one single pass so there's a card that

1104
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:03,259
two protocols it's a particle variation

1105
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:09,240
who want a support post right

1106
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:11,490
you get debit and then you have oh yeah

1107
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,850
this is Dave wheeler so so from my

1108
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:20,879
perspective there there's two issues one

1109
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:24,380
is is privacy and the other is the issue

1110
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:30,030
between multiple round trips to the Tam

1111
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:32,780
versus local storage in in my te the the

1112
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:34,980
way that Ming has described it I can

1113
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:38,580
maintain a list of

1114
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,790
that I've authenticated before and then

1115
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:44,400
I can use that to reduce the round-trip

1116
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:47,609
but if I don't have that storage hmm

1117
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:52,470
then I can't do that yep so an

1118
00:56:47,609 --> 00:56:55,619
alternative is to allow the TE to be

1119
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:58,649
configured or the t p-- agent to be

1120
00:56:55,619 --> 00:57:01,109
configured to either protect privacy and

1121
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:03,510
require the two round-trips or to be

1122
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:05,460
configured to say I don't really care

1123
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:08,940
about privacy and I'd rather be

1124
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,770
optimized for the round trips and in

1125
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:14,490
that case then you're opening yourself

1126
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:17,910
up to a potential privacy issue where

1127
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:20,430
you use a URL from the REE

1128
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:23,609
that's not trusted and you'd send your

1129
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:25,500
attestation information to a Tam that

1130
00:57:23,609 --> 00:57:28,109
you don't trust and they may not even

1131
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,750
respond back to you right or you could

1132
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:34,020
get a response back that's signed and

1133
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:36,990
the CA is not in your trust anchor list

1134
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:41,220
so then you don't trust it and you end

1135
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:45,149
the whole whole protocol exchange but

1136
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:47,189
but the trade-off here really is storage

1137
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:50,550
and privacy versus round trips and

1138
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:54,350
privacy and as well I'm the protocol

1139
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:57,270
specs the protocol specs only send the

1140
00:57:54,350 --> 00:58:00,359
the current working group one that

1141
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:02,130
Belcher pp1 that one only sends the FM

1142
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:06,330
station information encrypted with the

1143
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:12,720
Tam's key yeah so what happens is inside

1144
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:14,490
when line six five pharmacies Emma which

1145
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,319
a message that comes from the Tam

1146
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,609
includes a tiki which you may have

1147
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,190
cached and that's what you're encrypting

1148
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:22,500
it with our six key so that's the

1149
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:24,270
current protocols answer to the privacy

1150
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,640
question is you only send it to somebody

1151
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:28,770
so that can't actually decrypt it right

1152
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,160
right and in the discussion that Ming

1153
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:37,380
and I had the this morning we had a

1154
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:40,589
question about the trust anchor list and

1155
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:44,700
whether that included tam keys or

1156
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:46,890
whether that included CA keys for the

1157
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,689
Tam there's a

1158
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,670
presentation that Kyra has a ten minutes

1159
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:53,190
later on and exactly that's issue number

1160
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:54,360
63 right though we want to come back to

1161
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:56,850
that when it comes up

1162
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,860
great yeah yeah and in saying this we

1163
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:01,529
could discuss your either two point here

1164
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:04,290
why is if you already have time

1165
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:07,050
certificate here not CA you knew to

1166
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:09,750
trust right way then can't attract you

1167
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:12,480
to shoot for the single pass a second

1168
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:15,000
one say AHA I don't care or who knows

1169
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,220
Matt device ID so what right then that

1170
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,580
tip agent to a pre-installed there most

1171
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,589
probably yes ite it configure say when

1172
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:25,140
coming I decided give a sound requests

1173
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:27,510
used to say I forget this option right I

1174
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,700
could give a sign request talk to time

1175
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:31,770
or say no I to give you the you are you

1176
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,830
can't act I'll require you give me some

1177
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:36,240
data first those can happen there's a

1178
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:40,020
comfort of our architecture

1179
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:43,500
I said protocol scope right possible I

1180
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:45,660
think causes all general ideas here say

1181
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,560
we want to support this is our particle

1182
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:52,859
should support such use cases options

1183
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:55,140
then that relate to up schema of the

1184
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:58,020
schema your missus completeness writing

1185
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:01,230
in protocol spec will say what and miss

1186
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:05,490
at this this message here write a more

1187
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:09,810
site so this a flavor yeah good this is

1188
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:15,689
a good discussion another one another

1189
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:19,140
one this one talk about a say a use case

1190
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:22,020
where I have it yeah we talked about it

1191
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:24,480
we came with with us three entities

1192
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:27,180
again it three in today and then a

1193
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,450
diagram here you have similar provider

1194
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:34,080
you have time and you have device silver

1195
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:37,259
provider give a truss application to

1196
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:39,870
device right through attempt silver

1197
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,240
providers are not always a temp provider

1198
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,730
all right as a particular case however

1199
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:50,160
many supplies a software work Whizzer

1200
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:52,620
like at this time oops Tam is a camera

1201
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,410
manufacturer they put a software into

1202
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:59,250
camera but I'll have a AR model where

1203
01:00:55,410 --> 01:01:00,779
you have the confidential information I

1204
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,640
don't want even time

1205
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:06,240
no I don't want to give that the IP to

1206
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:09,330
the manufacturer right only I know now

1207
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,520
how do you deliver that to devices so

1208
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:15,770
that their case is here let's kiss here

1209
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,870
so no to that one first on T upon ray is

1210
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:21,470
encrypted form time to device so you see

1211
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:24,600
earlier I take a packet of flow here

1212
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:27,120
when t upon or is it distributed from

1213
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,890
tam-tam being encrypted by the baskis

1214
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,650
the only time a scanty question these

1215
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:35,480
channels into insecure what the topic

1216
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:39,000
here has silver provided behind this on

1217
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,850
another grammage a second yeah this aunt

1218
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,610
silver quarter here this diagram comma

1219
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:47,100
will give the TA into insecurity but

1220
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:50,960
from silver provider how to sever

1221
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:53,610
productivity binary @m cannot decrypt

1222
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,160
can't um she not see it because if time

1223
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:58,230
can reverse engineered code right so

1224
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,290
that's a problem which address that's

1225
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:02,850
actually interesting case and

1226
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:06,060
justification Notley it also delivered

1227
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:08,640
confidentiai p there so how to solve the

1228
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:11,549
problem how to solve a problem and a

1229
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,430
discussion come back ear say that case

1230
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:17,700
time can't deliver your application has

1231
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:20,339
simply between a binary which is just a

1232
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:22,439
generate code and confidential P Street

1233
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,440
as a personalization theta rather you

1234
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,720
initialize that artificial intelligence

1235
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:30,390
marble your theta mala is that as that

1236
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,819
data initialization piece so what do you

1237
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:33,779
have is that you have at am by

1238
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,870
manufacture

1239
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:38,220
reinstall software generic software

1240
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,900
whatever your am what do you have and

1241
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,779
you should has a data time we've got

1242
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:46,500
data time another time but at that time

1243
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:49,500
a silver provider you were hosted so

1244
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:52,290
that way we can leverage a sim time to

1245
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,330
device T per protocol without change so

1246
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:58,890
you guys dress Palmer that well yeah

1247
01:02:54,330 --> 01:03:01,319
there is a problem that well that's a

1248
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:03,299
proposal it may be other solution to

1249
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:06,360
dresses so far that to what we consider

1250
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:11,150
how to solve that problem provide a

1251
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:11,150
valid IP protection scheme

1252
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:17,150
this is the proposal from the editors

1253
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:19,130
right it's to remember the issue was

1254
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:20,930
introduced by saying we're gonna remove

1255
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,430
security debate and so the editors left

1256
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:24,379
all the use cases that security man was

1257
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:25,790
providing and assumption of security

1258
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,260
providers as well we want to make sure

1259
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,940
that when we route security domain it's

1260
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:31,430
related content we don't actually break

1261
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,020
any use cases so how could you maintain

1262
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:35,029
this use case and so they walk through

1263
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,910
all these and they said well the way

1264
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,839
that we deal with this is to have the

1265
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,060
service provider for this particular

1266
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:42,980
case they could have a second tab and

1267
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,480
you can reference that now hey or

1268
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,550
whatever it is and so you can use

1269
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,290
exactly the same protocol well how many

1270
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:49,760
changes and so they said well we should

1271
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,980
just update the architecture document to

1272
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,900
explain that fact yeah this world is a

1273
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,760
high-level would talk by the requirement

1274
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,640
is act a doc would put us

1275
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,710
yes we're supporting this use case a sac

1276
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,078
take this won't be a use gets you scope

1277
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:08,000
and it will talk high-level how can't

1278
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:09,859
dress this there's any objections then

1279
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,140
we can say yeah please duct tape your

1280
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:14,598
protection document to explain why you

1281
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:17,598
didn't break any of the use cases and it

1282
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:19,369
does not require protocol changes and

1283
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,470
then we can close the issue and a quota

1284
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:23,540
issued for that sixty four letters issue

1285
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:25,970
with you know how usual earlier but of a

1286
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:29,599
discover a valid use case and I was just

1287
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:31,578
attracted list this way also talked

1288
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,500
about how you can potentially use it

1289
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:35,930
with confidential code the example case

1290
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,040
is confidential personalization data but

1291
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:38,690
the same thing would work either way

1292
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,490
right whatever you can express in a suit

1293
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:42,140
manifest Brendan explained during the

1294
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:44,180
aedra meeting right that many of you are

1295
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:47,270
at you can use this to manifest to

1296
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:55,819
express any files or any contacts yet

1297
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:58,940
okay I thought it might kind of look so

1298
01:04:55,819 --> 01:05:00,920
this is so far it's a no that's a pretty

1299
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,140
much the interim a working session with

1300
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:07,700
hat is a major topics I think there's a

1301
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:09,410
fear could result from there so this is

1302
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:14,480
good to other issue list talked about

1303
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:16,490
this on earlier it's a TATP no not here

1304
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,359
and with this earlier but you thought

1305
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:21,859
earlier so hard to do that one it's a

1306
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:25,009
it's a complicate you know software

1307
01:05:21,859 --> 01:05:27,650
dependencies can be infinity loop or

1308
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:29,930
deep but whatever so is may sue to a

1309
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:32,090
group restart address similar problem or

1310
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:34,879
would defer to that one so what it is a

1311
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:42,050
document wise which adopted reflect that

1312
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:45,380
then we can close the issue multiple

1313
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:48,400
times for a single clan app all right

1314
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:52,550
just the example we said one Khurana

1315
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,840
can't depend t8 he has binary and

1316
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:56,990
personalization they could go to

1317
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:00,560
separate tab I even won't here can go to

1318
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:03,890
different tabs multiple times supported

1319
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:09,080
by one yes it's valid use case is in

1320
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:10,790
scope will support it and then this was

1321
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:16,130
from last meeting family you'll see more

1322
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:18,680
but it isn't no okay so it's just um

1323
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:20,510
so we will have documented update

1324
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:23,868
document that we have this one support

1325
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:28,640
we just say only that you notice this

1326
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:34,310
one I want to point out you could have

1327
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:36,560
multiple time but it's a this one single

1328
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:37,940
time content a bad tip right so that

1329
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,340
means that type of how all the other

1330
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,410
tears you have it multiple time but

1331
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:46,490
multiple time but forgiving tip you go

1332
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:48,470
to one and the tears supply their tier

1333
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:50,839
two that time if it's a different

1334
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:53,470
attempts that one time can talk all the

1335
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:56,090
time leak like it all it yes just like a

1336
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:57,618
google apps talk like a whole look after

1337
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,930
happy and won't plan you can turn them

1338
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:01,640
from one place but you decided to the

1339
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:02,540
article article do another class I was

1340
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,069
fine all right

1341
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:07,430
you can go to different places but all

1342
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:10,250
together this is a simplified decisions

1343
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:12,259
just say makes this live simplified not

1344
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:14,900
always really acted 200 different times

1345
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:19,160
all right so that's a quick burn on

1346
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:21,200
there for one device we reflected that

1347
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,450
in document which other could update

1348
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,649
there was a one word change there and

1349
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,649
every name we're ready to close

1350
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:34,600
[Applause]

1351
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:36,550
capability of agitations McKenna's

1352
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,410
they've you talk more

1353
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:42,100
there you live out to mass tomorrow so

1354
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:46,870
no help right go back okay

1355
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:49,690
aha day feeler hackathon participant we

1356
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:51,040
actually talked about this issue and so

1357
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:54,220
I just wanted to relay to the working

1358
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,400
group that there is something that an

1359
01:07:54,220 --> 01:08:00,430
implementation has to do with and my

1360
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:02,230
belief was that it did not require any

1361
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:04,120
changes to the architecture document and

1362
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:06,160
I want to share it here to see if people

1363
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,170
agree that it requires no change the

1364
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,480
architecture document okay and so what

1365
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:12,340
this is saying is that if I have a

1366
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,359
client app and the client app depends on

1367
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:18,430
two TAS okay let's take a case where one

1368
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,940
of those TAS is already installed in the

1369
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:23,529
t'ee

1370
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:26,019
and one of those TAS is not okay now the

1371
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:30,520
one that is installed may have been

1372
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:34,299
obtained from Tam one and the new ta

1373
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:36,940
needs to come from Tam - all right least

1374
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:38,410
that's what the manifest says okay so as

1375
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:39,580
an implementation decision you have to

1376
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:41,170
figure out how you're going to deal with

1377
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:43,689
that right does that mean that you want

1378
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:46,930
to ask Tam one which is the one that you

1379
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:48,278
already got ta one from for ta - or does

1380
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:50,170
it mean that it's perfectly fine because

1381
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:51,910
I'm only going to be talking to Tam -

1382
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:53,920
for everything and I just ignore the

1383
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,930
fact that I got that from Tam one all

1384
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,670
right that the first ta right and so how

1385
01:08:55,930 --> 01:09:00,100
do I do with this case I think is an

1386
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:01,960
implementation issue because I'm looking

1387
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,940
at the part in red here where it says a

1388
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,500
single team was contacted for a client

1389
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,790
to have right if you say oh that one was

1390
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,620
already installed okay

1391
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:10,689
then of course I'm gonna call - one only

1392
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:12,068
for the missing ones okay well what if

1393
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:13,839
ta one is actually right in the middle

1394
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:14,980
of the process of big installs right so

1395
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,870
you have these issues you know race

1396
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:18,939
conditions so how do you deal with that

1397
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:21,040
in me thinking through it at the

1398
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:23,169
hackathon I thought that this was an

1399
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,370
implementation issue and didn't need to

1400
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,170
be serviced to the level of the

1401
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,278
architecture document but it's something

1402
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,720
an implementation would actually

1403
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,880
definitely have to deal with because

1404
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,069
there it could easily come up I express

1405
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,330
a dependent to TAS one of them is

1406
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:35,980
already being installed or has already

1407
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:37,990
been installed for my different TA from

1408
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:41,589
where ta - what do I do about that

1409
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:43,240
okay so that's the question and I'm

1410
01:09:41,589 --> 01:09:45,609
interested in David wheelers I guess

1411
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,559
opinion as to whether you think it

1412
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:49,330
affects the architecture or not because

1413
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,049
right now I don't I think it's a

1414
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:55,540
protocol

1415
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:56,320
commentation issue but so the this is

1416
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:59,440
Dave wheeler

1417
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:03,190
so the discussion that we had last time

1418
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:07,089
and what I was putting forward was that

1419
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:10,000
this this problem really is a bit is

1420
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:14,590
yeah it's a bit some it's a bit

1421
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,510
manufactured in in a real ecosystem when

1422
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:20,800
a service provider puts out an

1423
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:23,860
application and they publish things to a

1424
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:27,159
Tam they're not going to publish part of

1425
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:29,739
the application to a Tam and part of the

1426
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:31,750
application to a different town the the

1427
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:33,519
whole application including the TAS is

1428
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:36,489
really going to be published to a single

1429
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,559
Tam and they're going to provide a list

1430
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:42,280
of Tam's that they've published to and

1431
01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:45,790
so the likelihood that when you do it

1432
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:48,040
install i've got to go to tam a to get

1433
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:50,260
part of the app and tam be to get

1434
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:52,989
another part of the app is really not

1435
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,550
likely to happen unless someone's really

1436
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:57,129
screwed up in the way that they're

1437
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:59,760
publishing their applications now the

1438
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:04,210
other thing that you described which is

1439
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:08,320
I've got this dependency and so do I

1440
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:12,130
know that ta one is fully installed and

1441
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,530
I have to go out and get ta be that

1442
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:17,980
whole kind of multi-threaded issue is

1443
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:21,610
really a local issue how does the tea

1444
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:26,259
broker and TE know that something's

1445
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:27,519
happening so yeah

1446
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:33,340
yes I agree with everything that they've

1447
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:36,520
set the the ecosystem point is if you

1448
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:38,349
have a particular TA that is out there

1449
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,940
that's like a third party ta that two

1450
01:11:38,349 --> 01:11:42,070
different client apps from different

1451
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:44,199
organizations want to depend on now of

1452
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:46,000
course in that particular case I agree

1453
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,409
the way you phrased it which is the

1454
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,690
client a vendor will pick a particular

1455
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:51,549
TA a particular Tam and that's where all

1456
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:53,049
of its dependencies will be and so that

1457
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:55,630
just means an ecosystem this is a

1458
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:57,520
particular example or a particular TA

1459
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:59,079
could be retrieved the exact same

1460
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,469
version could be done through either of

1461
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:03,829
two towns okay and so that's why I think

1462
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:05,749
it's an implementation

1463
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:07,219
issue because you can just assume that

1464
01:12:05,749 --> 01:12:09,169
you only care about the ones that are

1465
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:10,699
missing if the version number matches it

1466
01:12:09,169 --> 01:12:11,059
doesn't matter which can you got it from

1467
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:12,978
okay

1468
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:14,649
and that's why I believe that it does

1469
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:17,059
not affect the architecture document

1470
01:12:14,649 --> 01:12:18,739
that is just implementation because it's

1471
01:12:17,059 --> 01:12:21,320
as if you've got up on the other tan

1472
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:25,218
because the hash will match you agree

1473
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,898
okay so I think one an interesting

1474
01:12:25,219 --> 01:12:30,349
perspective of this is how we deal with

1475
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:33,919
open source right so open SSL is a

1476
01:12:30,349 --> 01:12:37,579
perfect example right we we a lot of

1477
01:12:33,919 --> 01:12:39,499
applications depend on open SSL but most

1478
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:41,599
of the time it's already installed on on

1479
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:43,959
the platform and you just have to make

1480
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:48,019
sure you've got the right version and

1481
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:51,289
suits gonna handle that for us so it in

1482
01:12:48,019 --> 01:12:53,629
that case if I don't have open SSL

1483
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:56,898
installed my te version of open SSL

1484
01:12:53,629 --> 01:12:59,269
it'll get pulled down if I do we ignore

1485
01:12:56,899 --> 01:13:02,780
it and suits gonna solve all those

1486
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:10,369
problems for us maybe but it might be

1487
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:12,759
useful to lattes your suit annotate that

1488
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:15,858
in New York picture is the example hmm

1489
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,199
for how it may become an implementation

1490
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:20,439
issue not how suits are gonna solve

1491
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:23,268
everything

1492
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:28,159
so when talk of this aren't you some

1493
01:13:23,269 --> 01:13:30,619
point I don't one thing when I caveat we

1494
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:34,459
talked about a single time contacted by

1495
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:38,299
cheaper broker which triggered by a tip

1496
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:42,919
agent remember to talk earlier exception

1497
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:46,550
is this data tap when when you solve

1498
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:49,459
something data and upon or separate you

1499
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:52,399
will go to two times not a one-time all

1500
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:54,648
right so we'll oh I think we'll add some

1501
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,929
this wording in architecture document

1502
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:59,989
just separate this one when you start

1503
01:13:56,929 --> 01:14:02,479
tech data time can be different which it

1504
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:05,148
differently this one's a much

1505
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,999
generically talked about to say one

1506
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:10,999
application multiple independent at es

1507
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:13,429
right different yes but if you seemed

1508
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:16,280
here I have a secret data and Bonaire

1509
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:18,500
and will allow you would have a

1510
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,540
and how to do that as a not to use

1511
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,280
ketchup on both the protocol in

1512
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:25,340
architecture we need a let's try to this

1513
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,639
is a little bit except Shinto that but

1514
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:34,540
we got categorized differently I got

1515
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:34,540
just no to that that interest in problem

1516
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:39,679
number seventeen this is this discussion

1517
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:41,269
is the one that is for 11:00 a.m.

1518
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,920
tomorrow so we're going to skip the

1519
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:48,890
issue number seventeen yeah this one

1520
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:52,700
every other its yeah Dave wheeler again

1521
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:56,750
so so we haven't talked about this table

1522
01:14:52,700 --> 01:15:06,050
ugly enough as you as you were

1523
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:09,890
discussing right so the the data so if

1524
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:14,570
if a service provider is providing a

1525
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:17,930
data temp so they're issuing out the

1526
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:21,230
personalization data applications they

1527
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:24,230
have to scale that their data Tam to be

1528
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:26,150
able to allow all devices that they're

1529
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:28,459
gonna service to be able to come to

1530
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:29,870
their Tam and and get that

1531
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:32,810
personalization data

1532
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:35,300
hmm in most cases if they're going to

1533
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:38,390
scale to that level they can also

1534
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:40,370
provide the bits for the application

1535
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:44,600
self so that's it yeah

1536
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:49,160
so I fall back to my previous position

1537
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:50,930
that I think that the service provider

1538
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,849
would probably just stand up their own

1539
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:56,290
Tam and they would have everyone come to

1540
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:59,210
them now there may be I can envision a

1541
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:00,830
service provider Tam saying I can

1542
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:04,820
deliver the bits for personalization

1543
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:07,940
which is maybe 128 encrypted bits but I

1544
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:11,030
can't give you the two megabits of the

1545
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:15,610
application and then may offload that to

1546
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:18,530
a you know a larger more scaled out Tam

1547
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:20,269
but I think in a lot of cases if

1548
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:23,210
someone's going to stand up do the

1549
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:24,320
effort to stand up at am the likelihood

1550
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,820
that they're not going to have the

1551
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:29,018
bandwidth to service the entire

1552
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:32,590
application to to their a

1553
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:36,130
is I wasn't wondering whether they meant

1554
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:40,119
dedicate to some more trustworthy town

1555
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:43,119
say I'm not do it for the kid to a your

1556
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:45,429
ham provider I really trust not like a

1557
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,159
manufacturing in a different country

1558
01:16:45,429 --> 01:16:51,269
something I just talk a lot of here

1559
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:53,079
right but I may have a time with hooli

1560
01:16:51,269 --> 01:16:56,800
hosted time they'd have all the

1561
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:58,539
capability and scalability service right

1562
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,190
so you don't have a who's your soft but

1563
01:16:58,539 --> 01:17:03,579
he's choice at a guy you dedicated to

1564
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:06,308
them yeah I'll be cautious of do we

1565
01:17:03,579 --> 01:17:09,579
let's not make the protocol overly

1566
01:17:06,309 --> 01:17:12,699
complicated in order to support going

1567
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:15,999
out to multiple Tam's if if that starts

1568
01:17:12,699 --> 01:17:17,888
to become an issue with the flow zone I

1569
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:20,530
don't think it will I think they can be

1570
01:17:17,889 --> 01:17:23,980
separate but if we start to have issues

1571
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:26,679
with you know coordinating different

1572
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:29,530
flows to different teams we may want to

1573
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:31,630
rethink what we're doing because if you

1574
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:35,110
do that at is this push it back to

1575
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:37,360
either silver provider host am host am

1576
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:39,670
themself to be that scalable right or

1577
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,339
they will have to find a one they can

1578
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:45,369
trust so you are me ready I've given

1579
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:47,260
everything to you so you will Wow onto

1580
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:50,889
yeah you would you were not disclose it

1581
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:52,809
yeah so okay now what I'm hearing in

1582
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:54,550
this discussion I want to confirm that

1583
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:57,369
our understandings right what I'm

1584
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:59,650
hearing is that we don't yet think it's

1585
01:17:57,369 --> 01:18:01,239
required to say that the 10th that the

1586
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:02,710
broker needs to talk to you might aims

1587
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:04,268
in any case right because we've talked

1588
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:07,300
about a couple cases here that I think

1589
01:18:04,269 --> 01:18:10,239
they was brought up where you can still

1590
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:12,550
do personalization data without having

1591
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:14,348
that broker talk to two towns right and

1592
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:16,659
a couple of those cases if I understand

1593
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:19,570
right is where the Surfrider hosts the

1594
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:20,768
Tam the service provider contracts is

1595
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,329
something they trust the host the

1596
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:24,159
template service provider things and

1597
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:25,900
then there's the case of course where

1598
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,129
the binary itself is bundled with the

1599
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,299
client happen so you don't have to do

1600
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:29,440
that and so you're only going to the

1601
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,760
tamp at the personalization a in the

1602
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,129
first place I think in all three ghost

1603
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,809
cases right yeah there's only one Tam

1604
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,219
with the broker talks to you and so I

1605
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:38,619
think what we're hearing is that we're

1606
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:40,570
not convinced there's any case in

1607
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:41,938
practice that we would actually need to

1608
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:45,329
talk to to Tanz is that

1609
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:47,579
what you're saying yes yes but now come

1610
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:49,739
back to this Oh Jeffrey ability here is

1611
01:18:47,579 --> 01:18:53,369
that are the printed packer now this on

1612
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:56,669
enemies this solution is not going to be

1613
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:59,098
used because this is this and talk about

1614
01:18:56,669 --> 01:19:02,880
say if you want protected as a I write

1615
01:18:59,099 --> 01:19:06,419
it is a kind of example am are wall that

1616
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:08,010
data will be given to Tam you trust you

1617
01:19:06,419 --> 01:19:10,019
don't have a host you let me know that

1618
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:11,999
attack because you know compact this

1619
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:15,630
song because in this case you talk it to

1620
01:19:11,999 --> 01:19:17,489
time my data time and find a bit tap so

1621
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:20,400
you've talked the same tap and then this

1622
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:23,039
Salida which is I wouldn't want to risk

1623
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,768
that one say for such a happy protection

1624
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,509
you find a time you trust and a you

1625
01:19:25,769 --> 01:19:30,059
develop post partner and data there

1626
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:32,550
right and if you go back to the if you

1627
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:34,559
go back to the previous slide from from

1628
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:41,039
last time where we where I talked about

1629
01:19:34,559 --> 01:19:45,800
this there's a the fourth bullet under

1630
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:48,959
resolution in in the case where a Tam

1631
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,900
doesn't you know only is doing the

1632
01:19:48,959 --> 01:19:56,309
personalization they can basically front

1633
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:59,699
a second tan behind them to pull the

1634
01:19:56,309 --> 01:20:03,599
information through the only issue where

1635
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:05,669
that wouldn't work is if that data Tam

1636
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:09,780
doesn't have the bandwidth to do that

1637
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:13,650
right and I just don't see that as as a

1638
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:17,309
barrier now maybe maybe in practice it

1639
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:19,530
is maybe I'm being too too freeway this

1640
01:20:17,309 --> 01:20:21,630
case you say there's a hundred templates

1641
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:24,570
and manufacture can will be fronting the

1642
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:27,269
data tap right because that to have

1643
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:29,429
majority piece of that either way or

1644
01:20:27,269 --> 01:20:32,249
either way it could be done right you

1645
01:20:29,429 --> 01:20:34,349
could contact the day of Tam get your

1646
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:37,829
personalization data directly and then

1647
01:20:34,349 --> 01:20:40,889
it could front for the application town

1648
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:43,110
yeah it's a it could is just a general

1649
01:20:40,889 --> 01:20:48,780
writing for Carthoris at that time has a

1650
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:49,249
less capacity right you can do it this

1651
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:53,909
way

1652
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:55,860
yeah if it could then that become proxy

1653
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:57,540
cut yeah I think that

1654
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:00,960
could that better time give whatever

1655
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:03,960
equipped data that fronting tap rocks it

1656
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,800
doesn't have visibility right I think I

1657
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,780
think though if you have the application

1658
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,880
Tam fronting the data Tam for

1659
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:13,769
personalization you've actually created

1660
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,440
a man-in-the-middle so you may not

1661
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:19,110
really get privacy in practice yeah then

1662
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,150
how we do the key exchange yeah yeah I

1663
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:23,519
was thinking about that because of who

1664
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:27,030
is a Tamara the my citations into which

1665
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,740
attempt we refer on team and yeah so I

1666
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:32,160
think we still need to think through

1667
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:36,570
this young Queen watch at alpha line

1668
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:42,630
before we finalize this on I think this

1669
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:45,690
chick is you know the two editors are

1670
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:48,600
still not quite converging and agreement

1671
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:50,940
it may not hurt to pick it up to the

1672
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:58,200
mail list so that others can provide

1673
01:21:50,940 --> 01:22:00,750
Vera this is honest I was wondering

1674
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:03,420
whether I'm so when Brendan presented

1675
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:08,210
the the suits work and how it applies to

1676
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:12,960
deep to me that personalization data

1677
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:15,270
concept that can be sort of like is part

1678
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,370
of the suit mechanism looks like a

1679
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:20,040
fairly simple mechanism doesn't require

1680
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:21,480
the deployment of a data time because

1681
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,960
the time when you create that

1682
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:28,679
personalization data and protected it

1683
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:30,750
that's not nothing specific to OT abhi

1684
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:34,890
itself and then when I hit add an

1685
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:36,780
terminology I here OTR be messages prop

1686
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:39,210
being processed here and I see that more

1687
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:40,620
as the developer needs to find out like

1688
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:42,420
how did he want to package the whole

1689
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:45,450
thing and how did he want how do they

1690
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:47,430
want to distribute certain things to no

1691
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:50,099
it's the certain extent yeah we assume

1692
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:52,290
that personalization data like I a model

1693
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,960
is something you won't put this manifest

1694
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:57,480
file right now put a suit because that

1695
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,540
would be blob into upon a blob somewhere

1696
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:06,030
you encrypted by atomizer center device

1697
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:08,790
from ISP provider has to be encrypted

1698
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:09,749
with a key that only that device guys or

1699
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:11,279
it out define that

1700
01:23:09,749 --> 01:23:13,139
by the definition of personalization day

1701
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:16,019
yeah yeah

1702
01:23:13,139 --> 01:23:19,019
so you think bye-bye that it has to be

1703
01:23:16,019 --> 01:23:22,889
Odia be sort of I'm part of a message

1704
01:23:19,019 --> 01:23:26,609
I'm ot a bit of a mess but yeah it'll be

1705
01:23:22,889 --> 01:23:32,039
a yes it's before the class that us yeah

1706
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:34,709
pieces can't be constructed or can't be

1707
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,499
finished or at least the content that is

1708
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:39,329
referenced in there if it's if it's a

1709
01:23:37,499 --> 01:23:41,009
reference right can't be finished until

1710
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:47,369
you have the key that you get from

1711
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:50,639
accurately the device public key sorry

1712
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:54,629
just have one worried about the

1713
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:57,839
scalability because what happens will

1714
01:23:54,629 --> 01:24:01,829
you have a very large number of IOT

1715
01:23:57,839 --> 01:24:04,318
devices that you cannot serve by one

1716
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:06,959
time you may need to split into multiple

1717
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:08,879
because otherwise there are all the

1718
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:11,039
scalability of sending that to Meg

1719
01:24:08,879 --> 01:24:13,979
whatever you have to send could be a

1720
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:17,219
problem so I'm not sure that it's not a

1721
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:20,729
privacy it's more of a reality of you

1722
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:22,619
know scalability so I'm wondering what's

1723
01:24:20,729 --> 01:24:24,569
happening in that case when you have the

1724
01:24:22,619 --> 01:24:26,669
same application but two times to talk

1725
01:24:24,569 --> 01:24:29,579
to because of depending on the region or

1726
01:24:26,669 --> 01:24:31,858
whatever so I'm not sure that that case

1727
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,688
the scale of BT in that case works

1728
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,729
you mean the question about the times

1729
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:38,459
the capacity to support magnatum Isis

1730
01:24:35,729 --> 01:24:40,889
well this is assumption you know what at

1731
01:24:38,459 --> 01:24:42,779
Google anyway we have many Internet

1732
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:46,019
services we have surveillance devices

1733
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:48,659
that if you host a time service you

1734
01:24:46,019 --> 01:24:51,539
can't design to support capacity that's

1735
01:24:48,659 --> 01:24:54,419
a sumption here time service you do that

1736
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:57,419
so well so the point is it's just like I

1737
01:24:54,419 --> 01:25:00,719
would do any other AWS service so yeah I

1738
01:24:57,419 --> 01:25:02,299
would I would stand up at am in multiple

1739
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:06,119
regions on AWS

1740
01:25:02,299 --> 01:25:09,809
I'd put my load of balance or somewhere

1741
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:12,749
in key right and I would use Amazon key

1742
01:25:09,809 --> 01:25:14,849
management to share that key so no

1743
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:16,139
matter where you were it looks like

1744
01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:18,349
you're talking to one Tam

1745
01:25:16,139 --> 01:25:23,119
yeah 1u Iowa boluses

1746
01:25:18,349 --> 01:25:27,530
oh yeah yeah another one time no just

1747
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:32,509
want time service you are it's a farm a

1748
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:34,340
service part okay now this one we talked

1749
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:40,510
about David Taylor tomorrow have

1750
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:43,340
dedicated a lot of this sauce anchor

1751
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:46,249
this is a warm for the also major topic

1752
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:48,019
right as a contextual label right and

1753
01:25:46,249 --> 01:25:50,449
time your trust anchor we need to

1754
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:53,510
support life cycle right away ng annum

1755
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:56,119
or delete older ones whatever right but

1756
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:59,359
after all what we roughly mention there

1757
01:25:56,119 --> 01:26:01,308
was that on this to question one is does

1758
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:03,439
it fit into architect document away

1759
01:26:01,309 --> 01:26:06,229
should be a separate document I said

1760
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:08,869
trust anchor what a format what format

1761
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:10,909
is right of transacts off and has update

1762
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:13,070
the two issues involve that issue city

1763
01:26:10,909 --> 01:26:17,108
to and 51 put together right what a

1764
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:20,090
format and how do you enable that update

1765
01:26:17,109 --> 01:26:23,300
at the same time we notice that a suit

1766
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:26,929
is a reverse and they may Soviet you

1767
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:29,479
have but this will need more work said

1768
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:33,229
away more work what a mangling here is

1769
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:35,809
suit is more for firmware update scheme

1770
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:37,639
nevermind standing but trust and is a

1771
01:26:35,809 --> 01:26:39,260
key management yeah it's true the

1772
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:42,169
management like a rather have a root

1773
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:44,659
imagine match at chrome and a Firefox

1774
01:26:42,169 --> 01:26:47,269
Mozilla and so on so that's different

1775
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:49,638
problem right well having out to Kingdom

1776
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:52,820
much deep on this one but it's a one for

1777
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:53,269
the open question I know it's a the open

1778
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,808
task

1779
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:58,249
Wartortle but it could update town so

1780
01:26:56,809 --> 01:26:59,989
learning you move the hacks and they

1781
01:26:58,249 --> 01:27:02,300
were not discuss away so once I always

1782
01:26:59,989 --> 01:27:05,629
ever have a will have special system ta

1783
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:08,689
which is a which has privilege to update

1784
01:27:05,629 --> 01:27:11,119
the trust anchors but I can't a new

1785
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:13,969
certificate removal routes on that a

1786
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:15,889
woman to push it but later there some

1787
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:18,739
more information about a suit whiticus

1788
01:27:15,889 --> 01:27:20,599
which along with them I think they need

1789
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:23,358
a more follow up whatever is that

1790
01:27:20,599 --> 01:27:25,729
evening scope for suit romantic kiss

1791
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:28,909
route keys recessive cats

1792
01:27:25,729 --> 01:27:32,469
I have impressions and not that but I

1793
01:27:28,909 --> 01:27:35,959
think they need to follow up at this one

1794
01:27:32,469 --> 01:27:40,719
one of the sutures I believe that this

1795
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:43,070
same problem is shared by suit whether

1796
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:46,369
suit believes that it can be solved with

1797
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:48,349
a manifest format I don't know yet

1798
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:49,999
I think it might be but I don't know

1799
01:27:48,349 --> 01:27:51,499
what the working group things or you can

1800
01:27:49,999 --> 01:27:54,320
look the editors of the documents that

1801
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:56,989
great now so yeah but I agreed that the

1802
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:58,070
same discussion would be in scope for

1803
01:27:56,989 --> 01:28:01,129
suit hmm

1804
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:03,169
so what am i mark our science up but

1805
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:05,239
it's a race it's here it's about a

1806
01:28:03,169 --> 01:28:07,760
dependency well all the line you said

1807
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:10,928
but then that'll be synchronized that

1808
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:14,389
workgroup there so we differ there this

1809
01:28:10,929 --> 01:28:16,159
work well if I differ then the architect

1810
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:19,130
on whether we can close it all will have

1811
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:21,348
to wait there to finish this

1812
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:23,780
that's a yeah to a group we need to be

1813
01:28:21,349 --> 01:28:25,999
line for sure it's just for this on

1814
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:28,398
webcam whether we can complete defer

1815
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:31,938
their before they have defined I think

1816
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:33,619
the possible overlap words can maybe in

1817
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:36,860
the intersection between teeth and suit

1818
01:28:33,619 --> 01:28:39,669
is if you consider the trust anchor

1819
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:42,079
store to be personalization data in the

1820
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:43,309
te and the firmware part of that that we

1821
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:44,389
need and it's squarely in the

1822
01:28:43,309 --> 01:28:47,869
intersection between the two groups

1823
01:28:44,389 --> 01:28:49,729
right and so both groups I think could

1824
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:51,558
discuss this okay okay I need a follow

1825
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:54,439
up as much as it is to issue still all

1826
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:57,050
parts they're gonna major issues others

1827
01:28:54,439 --> 01:29:01,219
say we talk about NFL I'd have felt it's

1828
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:05,030
a more than less complex and we're close

1829
01:29:01,219 --> 01:29:06,469
we're close to close those issues we're

1830
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:09,469
talk about this one you start here

1831
01:29:06,469 --> 01:29:15,499
single pass early and local T signing

1832
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:18,320
not bad one I would just keep this

1833
01:29:15,499 --> 01:29:21,199
allows the issue of talk today it's a we

1834
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:25,209
closely something there was a Anders who

1835
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:31,239
could bring up a proposal so King

1836
01:29:25,209 --> 01:29:34,510
proposal about ot IP protocol self

1837
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:37,009
current protocol he proposed a way use a

1838
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:37,669
session key based one I'm sitting the

1839
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,739
base one

1840
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:42,739
he's a pirate protocol is that clan

1841
01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:45,259
aside tip broker or less conceptually

1842
01:29:42,739 --> 01:29:48,410
tip broke and T page and API

1843
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:50,000
protocol tip broke or translated a JSON

1844
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:52,639
message process there

1845
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,740
don't push it down to the label more

1846
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:59,210
important like he said he would like to

1847
01:29:54,740 --> 01:30:01,490
have a tea and TAM used even oh man what

1848
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:05,210
kind of key change to negotiation key

1849
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:07,580
after that future attestations based

1850
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:10,280
attestation key you can station key our

1851
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:13,370
future as they already artists you have

1852
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:16,370
proved our use agitation proof so that

1853
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:20,720
one there is a proposal is a can we move

1854
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:22,880
that direction and we added the chair

1855
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,440
sort of commented we'll look at this one

1856
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,140
first of all convey this dramatic change

1857
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:30,679
from current JSON see bond based

1858
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:33,380
protocol kind of a stateless move to a

1859
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:36,740
pioneer protocol and use a session key

1860
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:38,810
tutor our remaining asset Asia like ITT

1861
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:41,320
nari try to leverage rats

1862
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:44,360
I don't Amaro Tyler grass and use a

1863
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:46,910
manufacture suit to data traumatic it's

1864
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:49,790
a word different that Concepcion mala is

1865
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:51,740
a dramatic change alright second one the

1866
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:54,380
pirate probabilities and simple protocol

1867
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:57,880
will also fail this is more friendly

1868
01:30:54,380 --> 01:31:02,660
right friendly you to depart you to read

1869
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:04,790
the third ones the patent that taken out

1870
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:07,639
is a patent either he would write you're

1871
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:10,460
free maybe but it's a repentant domain

1872
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:13,190
so based on that one fell this all what

1873
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:16,010
you know felt comfortable go there it's

1874
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:19,129
a lack of support United us and then the

1875
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:21,350
filer just close issue that I do want to

1876
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:26,420
report all the issues we saw and it gave

1877
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:27,710
me practice would group and yeah so this

1878
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:32,180
are the coast and fine

1879
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:34,310
so that's a long silence after the issue

1880
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:36,040
was filed there was looked like it was

1881
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:38,690
lack of interest and eventually I think

1882
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:43,880
David wheeler generated response and

1883
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:47,120
then I generally response it was a

1884
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:50,060
support on the list for this and so

1885
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:52,940
since the issue was already closed it

1886
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:55,160
seems to be consensus but facing the

1887
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:57,049
objections let us know because the the

1888
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,849
fire seemed to close it themselves

1889
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,690
saying this

1890
01:31:57,849 --> 01:32:02,650
to not be interested in doing this

1891
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:04,629
session negotiation but there really

1892
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:06,400
were two different aspects of this

1893
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:08,219
proposal that are somewhat separable

1894
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:11,409
right one was the notion of having

1895
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:15,340
sessions and I think that's the one that

1896
01:32:11,409 --> 01:32:17,489
had the IP that property associates on I

1897
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:20,530
mean the notion of saying the protocol

1898
01:32:17,489 --> 01:32:22,959
between the TE and the TAM as opposed to

1899
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:25,300
transfer is some binary format instead

1900
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:27,099
of JSON rc4 and just you see Jason

1901
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:28,840
Seifer as the transport for some binary

1902
01:32:27,099 --> 01:32:30,849
format that I think was an orthogonal

1903
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:33,130
point that it combined both of those two

1904
01:32:30,849 --> 01:32:35,889
aspects that's proposal and we didn't

1905
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:37,480
see support from anybody other than the

1906
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,989
file where for either of those aspects

1907
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:43,178
and so unless those objections this is

1908
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:44,769
already closed but beacon for confirming

1909
01:32:43,179 --> 01:32:47,050
consensus that there are no objections

1910
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:56,380
to closing due to lack of interest other

1911
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:57,610
than flower thank you this is Hank a

1912
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:00,389
little bit clueless about this issue

1913
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:03,699
because I haven't read it before I

1914
01:33:00,389 --> 01:33:07,510
really don't the binary protocol doesn't

1915
01:33:03,699 --> 01:33:09,190
jaysis slash seaboard things here we're

1916
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:11,260
doing together that aspect of the

1917
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:14,110
proposal which was independent of the

1918
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:17,530
other one at least as I read it I was

1919
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:22,829
today we have OTR P carried in a

1920
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:27,820
transport okay by analogy the filers

1921
01:33:22,829 --> 01:33:29,949
proprietary protocol used a binary Mina

1922
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:34,119
packet format diagrams and there to be

1923
01:33:29,949 --> 01:33:36,730
some that between the same layer as what

1924
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:41,348
OTR P works and JSON rc4 at the

1925
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:43,480
transport layer okay so Jason and so the

1926
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:45,940
broker prat cracks out the JSON or C for

1927
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:49,089
cracks out the binary blob passes that

1928
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:51,610
into te e and that the binary blob is

1929
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:54,670
what's passed between inside the TE

1930
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:58,540
right that was his primary protocol to

1931
01:33:54,670 --> 01:34:00,369
get that okay yeah so he said oh well I

1932
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:02,260
could do this in binary and yet you

1933
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:04,929
still need a parser for that yeah no

1934
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:08,159
easy that one this become all the

1935
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:10,480
comment that icon that aspect saying

1936
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:11,250
well it seems to me like you're still

1937
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,200
gonna heavy

1938
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:15,900
right I didn't see an advantage of

1939
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:17,849
having a binary one over having a say

1940
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,410
well fed and Siebert parser right who

1941
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:21,450
why does that matter

1942
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:24,690
yeah I see the point okay thanks and

1943
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:26,340
maybe Highness is something yeah there's

1944
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:30,540
this Dave wheeler part of that

1945
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:32,970
discussion that I recall from from the

1946
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:35,700
discussion with Anders was he didn't

1947
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:38,310
think that a JSON parser would fit in

1948
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:41,880
many of the small T E's which may be

1949
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:44,880
true and and there were security

1950
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:47,910
concerns around putting those

1951
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:51,120
full-fledged JSON parsers inside the TE

1952
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:54,480
as well and and I think there's some

1953
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:56,309
there's some validity to that I think in

1954
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:59,070
in many cases were putting much more

1955
01:34:56,310 --> 01:35:03,870
into ease today then then perhaps even

1956
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:06,719
five years ago on the on the session

1957
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:11,610
based stuff I had some discussions

1958
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:14,430
around at Intel we do have different

1959
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:16,769
attestations we call them stream based

1960
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:19,380
access stations where we negotiate

1961
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:23,880
session key and attach a test stations

1962
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:26,910
to that negotiation but that requires

1963
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:29,460
then that the parties to the protocol

1964
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:32,820
are two distinct points and and you

1965
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:35,760
can't flow attested data beyond that

1966
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:37,620
endpoint because it's the attestation is

1967
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,200
basically gone it's it's part of the

1968
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:43,860
channel so you really know no better off

1969
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:46,800
than maybe doing TLS and and carrying

1970
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:50,580
some attestation during the TLS session

1971
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:54,000
and so it makes it hard to build an

1972
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:56,730
ecosystem around the Tam when your data

1973
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,940
once it leaves the pipe is no longer a

1974
01:35:56,730 --> 01:36:03,269
tested - and and verifiable so that's

1975
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:05,690
the reason why from my position we

1976
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:09,540
didn't want to go with a session based

1977
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:11,549
attestation we wanted a token based as

1978
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:13,680
we talked about with rats where the

1979
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:18,950
signature is attached to the data your

1980
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,950
your your passing back and forth

1981
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,420
I think the interesting part of the

1982
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:27,730
conversation was the question about what

1983
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:29,739
do you put in the in a normal world what

1984
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:36,820
versus what are you placing in the

1985
01:36:29,739 --> 01:36:39,459
secure world and my um I discussed this

1986
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:42,880
on on the list with understand and I

1987
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:45,750
don't see how you maintain the

1988
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:50,140
functionality and security and then

1989
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:53,230
still not put most part of the code into

1990
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:56,380
the secure word that's what I I I

1991
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:58,059
couldn't come up with a story while it

1992
01:36:56,380 --> 01:37:00,580
sounds nice to just do the crypto

1993
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:02,770
operations in in the secure word but

1994
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:05,050
then what's the semantics of all of this

1995
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:07,300
if you do the rest in there no word in

1996
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:11,199
it and the secure word essentially

1997
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:14,890
trusts science or encrypts some hashes

1998
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:17,460
and that that makes me still makes me

1999
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:20,260
wonder of how this is supposed to work

2000
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:21,909
but if someone of you has some ideas on

2001
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:23,469
how to better make that split and but

2002
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:25,750
for you according to the trusted

2003
01:37:23,469 --> 01:37:29,380
information base of course that would be

2004
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:32,409
really great having said that the new

2005
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:35,290
version and that I put together for

2006
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:37,480
presentation tomorrow actually has fewer

2007
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:40,570
messages and fewer and let much less

2008
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:42,218
functionality so by that it already has

2009
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:47,320
this much smaller trusted information

2010
01:37:42,219 --> 01:37:48,909
base that the binary protocol versus

2011
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,830
Jason and see where protocol I will

2012
01:37:48,909 --> 01:37:52,719
argue that that is not an architecture

2013
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:54,699
document issue it's a no tricky issue

2014
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:56,320
and tomorrow and how does this

2015
01:37:54,699 --> 01:37:58,809
presentation tomorrow we will talk about

2016
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,480
OTR PE where I think thank you David for

2017
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:03,940
summarizing others as if you would say

2018
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:06,730
JSON inside and we'll talk about using

2019
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:09,580
see Bohr is the current proposal to

2020
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:14,709
solve that at the protocol levels and

2021
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:17,710
that of the architecture level yeah it's

2022
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:20,650
no - we'll talk about tomorrow the OTR

2023
01:38:17,710 --> 01:38:22,360
TV - proposal supports both Jason and c4

2024
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:24,040
but even before that we have had

2025
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:27,130
discussions in this working group that

2026
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:29,110
says we should probably want to allow c4

2027
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:30,940
as an option that's come up in a number

2028
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:32,250
of different meetings but that is not

2029
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:34,950
something that's an architecture

2030
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:37,620
if you will come back tomorrow so out of

2031
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:41,610
that time this one issue actually this

2032
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:44,340
is proposed arrest us three years ago a

2033
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:48,480
long time ago when we did the OT IP in

2034
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:50,130
bikini so what do we look that at right

2035
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:55,379
and for look at idea - it's done not a

2036
01:38:50,130 --> 01:39:00,740
good fit this another reason is a scope

2037
01:38:55,380 --> 01:39:02,970
wise this this session scheme was a for

2038
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:03,990
security provision if you look at the

2039
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:07,560
protocol is called

2040
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:10,080
SKS secure key storage that what he put

2041
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:12,690
in seeker element a smart card it's more

2042
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:16,700
address to the security key probation

2043
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:18,179
but the OTP small tracer trust app

2044
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:20,460
management it's an application

2045
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:21,720
management not only for the key

2046
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:24,720
provision it's not key management

2047
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:27,030
protocol that it was a really tracer for

2048
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:29,400
the key management protocol for key

2049
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:31,860
storage e into a CSA music o elements so

2050
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:34,110
on so it's a different flavor right it's

2051
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:36,089
a strongly realized that one is that an

2052
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:39,330
article back to the other world kind of

2053
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:42,090
have keep off my hip on say keep off my

2054
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:44,580
key provision workgroup whirling IETF we

2055
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:47,120
have yes it's a three-phase rights we

2056
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:50,309
face probation and key into a device

2057
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:52,380
yeah that way you decision keep you to

2058
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:54,630
be all trace the key management this

2059
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:56,250
one's a application management we don't

2060
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:58,530
want to really focus that one use that

2061
01:39:56,250 --> 01:40:01,260
one that's where the binary could API

2062
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:03,840
call lower lower tier he won't really go

2063
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:05,910
to Silicon label so it's a different

2064
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,340
that's a I didn't word elaborate much

2065
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:10,349
here but as I'm a one however you see it

2066
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:13,770
is a application management and worst

2067
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:18,570
key management that wears not a great

2068
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:20,000
fate right okay so one more issue and

2069
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:23,660
the curious gonna come up and present

2070
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:28,010
the last of the is happy shoe survey

2071
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:28,010
okay thank you

2072
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:44,590
this one is what issue number 65 I think

2073
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:48,070
it's in the agendas hello um this is a

2074
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:51,310
key that schemata working oh thank you

2075
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:56,950
working for a iced tea which is Japanese

2076
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:58,960
national R&D organization and the reason

2077
01:40:56,950 --> 01:41:05,440
I made the slide yesterday during the

2078
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:08,860
hackathon with the suzaki-san and it'll

2079
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:13,299
be founded they've been honest and mean

2080
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:16,059
or thought or five was can I go to the

2081
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:21,670
next slide yeah oh I think push the

2082
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:24,870
button I see so these are some of the

2083
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:26,920
files where to put the keys and

2084
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:30,610
certificate and Cas

2085
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:35,080
because this documentation for tea

2086
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:38,139
architecture draft is trying to be made

2087
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:41,170
to be generic as possible not not

2088
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:45,280
binding to any particular CPU not

2089
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:47,230
particularly trying to bind the who is

2090
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,840
the developer of ta or who is the

2091
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:54,280
developer the service provider or who is

2092
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:56,260
uh who is developing at EE and so ta

2093
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:58,830
could have multiple time or to

2094
01:41:56,260 --> 01:42:01,030
considering many different kind of or

2095
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:05,200
situation for example client could have

2096
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:08,380
many TA or mini situation so the page

2097
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:12,130
goes to 37 written as generic as

2098
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:16,270
possible and then when I tried to think

2099
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:19,830
about how to try extend our initial

2100
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:23,470
prototype implementation I got confused

2101
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:26,920
first ten pages of a knowledge is

2102
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:32,200
disappearing from might not rain so try

2103
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:35,050
to enumerate on the slides so we when

2104
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:37,300
when we enhance or initial prototyping

2105
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:41,320
we won't put it in the differ on

2106
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:44,640
location of the keys in signature and CA

2107
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,639
cert so

2108
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:53,160
so in the this first first one is in

2109
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:56,220
second first diagram and second diagram

2110
01:42:53,160 --> 01:43:01,559
is pretty much doing the same whoo

2111
01:42:56,220 --> 01:43:06,270
which ta could be loaded in verified in

2112
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:08,340
or on executed and in the teeth

2113
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:15,090
architecture documentation

2114
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:19,170
ta must be must be signed by service

2115
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:24,450
private provider and need to be verify

2116
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:26,730
from the agent or or TRP agent so which

2117
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:27,960
word it's going to be used in the

2118
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:41,910
documentation in the future I'm not

2119
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:44,489
ready sure both that was one time

2120
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:47,610
another we try to mount EPA agent but a

2121
01:43:44,489 --> 01:43:49,500
poor Department so far okay product one

2122
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:52,920
for particle if you have three protocol

2123
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,570
in future that do a captive agent corner

2124
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,660
salute ERP agent but I will try to come

2125
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:59,940
back TP agent architecture document and

2126
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:04,700
transport document news t p-- agents and

2127
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:10,530
so that's the one we're moving to no

2128
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:13,559
okay thank you and so another motivation

2129
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:16,800
of making this slide was writing the

2130
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:20,190
code on te side especially on arm it's

2131
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:24,720
not easy as easy to write it code on the

2132
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:29,400
re re si most of the not doesn't have

2133
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:31,590
much rich system call or library massive

2134
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:35,549
library you could easily use it in t

2135
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:37,320
side so if I miss it starting the

2136
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:39,510
implementing in something and we re

2137
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:40,950
siding and later I have to move in at

2138
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:44,220
ISA they will be caused a lot of

2139
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:46,679
headaches and pretty much the same it's

2140
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:48,840
how was this how the T is going to be

2141
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:51,750
done in the risk of 5/2 which is our

2142
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:55,170
objective running T on verse five and

2143
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:56,670
having T absolutely working on risk five

2144
01:44:55,170 --> 01:45:02,720
- so which

2145
01:44:56,670 --> 01:45:04,020
and and so so and the second one is

2146
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,870
correct

2147
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:11,910
my understanding of interest GX arm

2148
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:15,450
trust zone at least that on ops t/ta

2149
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:19,050
must be signed by te to be loaded and

2150
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:21,929
executed so let's jump in here because

2151
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:23,880
you take my name on this line that the

2152
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:26,450
previous slide it was the one that was

2153
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:30,450
about what's allowed to be loaded whoops

2154
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:31,920
this slide is actually about the one

2155
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:33,480
with the red guy the one of the green

2156
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,240
box is about what's allowed to be loaded

2157
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,879
right and so the spca sir does whatever

2158
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:41,460
is in your loader whether it's op t or

2159
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:45,270
you have launched Enclave or whatever on

2160
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:47,340
the red slide this is about the keys

2161
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:50,010
that happen when you are loaded that are

2162
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:51,510
used for SF station or evidence right

2163
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:53,310
because if it chains up to a hardware

2164
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:54,960
root of trust this is the keys that are

2165
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:57,180
used in the dice chain which is used for

2166
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,790
attestation right this is wrong relate

2167
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:01,350
to the discussion we have tomorrow when

2168
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:02,730
we get into the rats discussion all

2169
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:04,590
right these keys are not used for

2170
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:06,299
loading this is when you do get loaded

2171
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:07,650
you get measured and this is what is

2172
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:10,860
then used to feed into your active

2173
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:13,290
station information so I just wanted a

2174
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:15,030
credit card correct what the dice chain

2175
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:17,220
is used to wear it's not used for to

2176
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:20,219
decide what loads it's when you know you

2177
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:24,230
generate the dice chain so Dave wheeler

2178
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:28,470
I'm confused on this slide with the red

2179
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:32,160
where the TA is signed by the t te

2180
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:36,300
private key in even in an attestation

2181
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:38,280
flow right the TA should be signed by

2182
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:42,210
the service provider that developed it

2183
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:44,550
now the the its agent you end up with

2184
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:46,110
two different search chains and that the

2185
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:49,500
two defense hurricanes ones used for

2186
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:51,690
attestation purposes but in an

2187
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:54,690
attestation I want to know who wrote the

2188
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:57,269
code right so hey I'm gonna be compare

2189
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:59,790
that part of tomorrow's the scope okay

2190
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:02,010
so maybe this particular slide we can

2191
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:03,600
come back to you after I've got my

2192
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,950
tomorrow we do have at least one of the

2193
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,050
participants I see Hank is in the room

2194
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:09,360
is one of the people that only gonna be

2195
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:09,960
there after 11:00 tomorrow and so it's

2196
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,940
probably for

2197
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:13,650
can anybody else that we advertise to

2198
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,910
rats saying it's going to be part of

2199
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:16,679
this discussion coming 11:00 tomorrow

2200
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:17,580
and I expect those the people who are

2201
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:24,330
going to be involved in this discussion

2202
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:25,469
okay well we are welcome to come back to

2203
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:27,540
this when we come back to your issue

2204
01:47:25,469 --> 01:47:32,520
number 17 discussion you're back up here

2205
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:34,500
you're welcome to regenerate this and to

2206
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:44,850
me this isn't too related that's part of

2207
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:46,530
this I'm glad I put it in the Cypress I

2208
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:48,480
love this because this is this is

2209
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:54,500
something I was also confused with the

2210
01:47:48,480 --> 01:48:00,929
first page in the second page and

2211
01:47:54,500 --> 01:48:02,160
there's only two more slides yes is

2212
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:07,140
there anybody that has not seen the blue

2213
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:09,750
sheets raise your hand even if you have

2214
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:12,420
not seen the blue she's okay thank you

2215
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:15,690
this is our 12 minute warning please

2216
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:18,180
send the blue cheese over one question

2217
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:22,349
to the Fuhrer yes I have these issues

2218
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:32,489
been posted to the kid hunt yes I just

2219
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:35,250
post the PDF on the github the issue is

2220
01:48:32,489 --> 01:48:37,739
that some of the implementers have found

2221
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:39,600
the document unclear about which keys

2222
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:41,639
were in which location and they were

2223
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:43,469
trying to correlate between the table

2224
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:45,120
and the in the architecture document and

2225
01:48:43,469 --> 01:48:47,310
the diagram the air protector document

2226
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:50,460
and we're having problems correlating to

2227
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:52,950
so this isn't just editorial issue yeah

2228
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:55,260
yeah this amine pants are just yeah at

2229
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:58,410
that market a document I have keys

2230
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:01,140
certificates in the table in tables is a

2231
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:04,230
client the last time that in not eating

2232
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:06,780
a thing wasn't a crime she's really

2233
01:49:04,230 --> 01:49:10,950
boxes where's that way stop so we can

2234
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:12,900
has talked about in my keys right

2235
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:17,519
he's four at the station key for

2236
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:19,080
anything yeah I saw the way that you

2237
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,450
know Hakkasan that works attacks on

2238
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,460
helpful with tacos right so when

2239
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:25,380
audience feel this with

2240
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:27,000
understand aware DSN immune so I thought

2241
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:29,310
from I need to paint away to a la

2242
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,960
strategy you know preparing slides with

2243
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:32,730
their own purposes ensuring them about

2244
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,010
to say is this right is this what the

2245
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:36,509
document means he said that looks

2246
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,130
interesting you should present these

2247
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:39,780
pledge to the working group and if

2248
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:40,739
everybody agrees then we at least know

2249
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:43,320
that everybody is the same understanding

2250
01:49:40,739 --> 01:49:45,089
of the interpretation so yeah it was a

2251
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:47,040
place code to there but just today so

2252
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:50,700
whether is it good to next level

2253
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:55,440
yeah it's not like sign - yeah just

2254
01:49:50,700 --> 01:50:00,570
trying to clarify page 19 of this ASCII

2255
01:49:55,440 --> 01:50:03,480
chart yes and the the third slide is

2256
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:06,090
most of the authority documentation

2257
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:08,129
talks about how to pass the authority

2258
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:14,040
for binary format between the time and

2259
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:17,310
deep agent so so um yes in the

2260
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:21,120
discussion yesterday is pretty much was

2261
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:24,180
obvious that ten private key and T's see

2262
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:29,430
a cert is on Tam and opposite on the T

2263
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:38,730
agent and this was it was yes it was

2264
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:41,070
pretty straightforward and clear yes in

2265
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:42,540
this slide of discussion we're not

2266
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:45,420
talking about trust

2267
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:47,670
anchor update or anything just when we

2268
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:50,969
start the message or when you start the

2269
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:53,400
TA or generate the TA where the key will

2270
01:50:50,969 --> 01:51:00,210
be in where who is the how it will be

2271
01:50:53,400 --> 01:51:03,480
verified and the last one is I'm not

2272
01:51:00,210 --> 01:51:05,270
particularly sure it's does it match in

2273
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:09,839
the

2274
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:13,410
architectural documentation or whether

2275
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:15,630
it's going to be really used as as it is

2276
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:20,040
in the implementation but um my

2277
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:23,250
understanding was om will have TFM pub

2278
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:25,320
pub and private key pair and the device

2279
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:28,680
will have a private key and then the

2280
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:32,519
time or able to verify the device with

2281
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:37,020
it I gave a comment here I guess I have

2282
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:40,930
a Varginha author on Dashawn make it up

2283
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:44,140
we Tom justify this agitation the time

2284
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:47,920
trust device firstly trust tiki mighty

2285
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:49,480
certificate chin into a TC yeah you have

2286
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:52,900
that one in last slide I would have your

2287
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:55,599
TCA optionally the Archana of the

2288
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:58,000
original option I would have said that T

2289
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:00,520
we install is from secure boot at a

2290
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,920
firmware tea table case the trusted

2291
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:06,190
firmware sorry from work he was

2292
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:08,020
scientist at T loaded is from secure

2293
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:10,870
boot and from Secretary's home where

2294
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:13,510
even that can have a certificate later

2295
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:16,540
can make a decision say this is device

2296
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:19,780
which run T which further secured by a

2297
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:25,810
secret boot so you have a to trust level

2298
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:28,120
trustee itself also optionally demand or

2299
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:30,130
mandate whether you want to say you must

2300
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:34,180
give me a shuttle firmware last

2301
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:38,489
assertion but when this protocol gets to

2302
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:41,860
the last few sessions where ITF we are

2303
01:52:38,489 --> 01:52:45,190
retiring that trust firmware requirement

2304
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:49,750
because some t turn on habit i just not

2305
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:52,780
also it's not normal so normalized so

2306
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:56,320
that was i think we're good to put out a

2307
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:57,610
formula tech document so we if you could

2308
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:00,549
wear less the slide you can see that

2309
01:52:57,610 --> 01:53:03,699
time always have a TCA keys there right

2310
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:05,650
that what a trusted right TCA you trust

2311
01:53:03,699 --> 01:53:09,040
the last agitation based on at the wise

2312
01:53:05,650 --> 01:53:09,879
key firmware was optional in our

2313
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:13,120
document

2314
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:17,190
but a new one we are making a way out so

2315
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:17,190
that will be updated

2316
01:53:24,389 --> 01:53:30,219
so let me this is Dave wheeler let me

2317
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:33,010
agree with me

2318
01:53:30,219 --> 01:53:35,860
I think the trusted firmware is probably

2319
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:39,130
still going to be an example so if you

2320
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:41,500
go back to your previous slide this is

2321
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:44,170
going to be the trust relationship so

2322
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:47,619
the TE the te will have a private key

2323
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:50,980
which the Tam will trust in the

2324
01:53:47,619 --> 01:53:53,769
implementation we will talk about the

2325
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:59,459
the next slide where you have a trusted

2326
01:53:53,770 --> 01:54:03,070
firmware and your T private key will

2327
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:05,830
will have a a route that goes back to a

2328
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:10,480
trusted firmware key or something so so

2329
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:13,989
your the key for the TE maybe its itself

2330
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:17,709
just a single key or it may be part of a

2331
01:54:13,989 --> 01:54:22,989
trust chain and the trust chain is just

2332
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:26,349
an implementation option a trust in is

2333
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:30,009
from the wrong bootloader

2334
01:54:26,349 --> 01:54:33,070
yeah first bootloader and then you if I

2335
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:37,199
were you you boot and then yes right and

2336
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:43,179
the MP in yes and in some of the

2337
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:48,549
hardware based T's it may appear as

2338
01:54:43,179 --> 01:54:52,300
though it's a single key in Te but it

2339
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:54,969
may actually be derived from other

2340
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:57,570
Hardware keys through through different

2341
01:54:54,969 --> 01:55:01,330
processes as well so it may not actually

2342
01:54:57,570 --> 01:55:04,360
expose itself as a certificate chain

2343
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:08,860
although it may be some sort of Hardware

2344
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:11,440
chained P so and we'll try to explain

2345
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:14,019
that better in the in the architecture

2346
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:16,059
document we haven't gotten to to that

2347
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:20,710
stage yet and that that's probably where

2348
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:24,239
a lot of the confusion lies well thank

2349
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:25,420
you and this is the best fight yeah

2350
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:28,989
thank you

2351
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:31,900
okay so unless there's no other orders

2352
01:55:28,989 --> 01:55:34,259
of business we're running out of time so

2353
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:38,650
what we're going to do is we're gonna

2354
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:47,170
mm-hmm a hackathon report and so I'll

2355
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:49,690
update the agenda so the transport

2356
01:55:47,170 --> 01:55:52,920
presentation will start tomorrow session

2357
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:55,629
with the transport presentation and then

2358
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:59,200
proceed with the agendas as per me

2359
01:55:55,630 --> 01:56:04,060
tomorrow so if anybody has not signed

2360
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:08,550
the blue sheet please do so otherwise we

2361
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:08,550
are done until tomorrow thank you
