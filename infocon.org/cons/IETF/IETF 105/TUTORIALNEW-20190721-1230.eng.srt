17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,740
things that we can do to make your

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,810
experience here at the IETF better there

19
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,660
is a mailing list edge.you - team at

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,940
IETF Torg it's in one of the slides

00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,240
speakers for today providing the

25

newcomers area we have Angela Maharshi

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,039
from Boston University I'm fairly

27
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,930
certain I mispronounced her last name

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
because she's always been just on child

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,890
to me but as I turned to her I was like

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,479
oh I just realized I don't know how to

31
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,990
pronounce your last name but you can fix

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,220
it and rich cells from Akamai so I hope

33
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,339
you all enjoy this and I'll talk to you

38
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,500
these things work

39
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,290

on the security of internet protocols

48
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:32,120
and here at ITF I am involved with

49
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:35,300
several working groups primarily with

50
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:40,760

people they have done a great job you'll

78
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:16,610
see so first of all this and the

79
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,760
following slide these are the ietf note

80
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,620
well slide as the name suggests it's a

81
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,160
note well slide so you better note it

82
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,170
well you're going to see the slide a lot

83
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,730
of times during this entire week

84
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,469
specifically before every working group

85
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,940
session and we'll talk about what

86
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,440
working groups are and what working

87
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,140
group sessions are but you are going to

88
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,750
see this slide the sliders basically it

89
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,939
applies to all the ietf participation

90
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,020
whether you are participating in person

91
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,290
or remotely it basically reminds you

92
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:54,050
that all the participants of the IETF

93
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,829
agrees to abide by the IETF policies on

94
00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:01,189
various topics I don't expect you to

95
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:04,190
read this whole thing right now but it's

96
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:08,540
important that you read it before any

97
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,339
sort of participation at ITF this is

98
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,579
again the continuation of the IETF note

99
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,880
note well slide these are different

100
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,670
BCPs that is best contract current

101
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,870
practices documents which are the RFC's

102
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:28,339
and they have like details on several

103
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:32,540
topics that ITF IETF has policies on and

104
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:36,050
that you as an ITF participant would

105
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,930
agree to abide by there is BC p4

106
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,540
standards processes working group

107
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,359
processes where the most of the work of

108
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,630
IETF happens then there are policies for

109
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,480
anti-harassment code of conduct patents

110
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,839
and copyright and then most recently

111
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,990
there is a BCP on privacy policy that is

112
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,620
about the interim that how ITF handles

113
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:03,050
all the information that you provide to

114
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,030
ITF so if you guys are interested in

115
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:10,229
that kind of thing you should go through

116
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:15,240
all these BCPs okay

117
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:18,600
so here at IDF we try to provide you

118
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,640
with all the necessary information and

119
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,950
resources that are necessary for you to

120
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,140
get started for this week and get

121
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,300
integrated into the community so there

122
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:31,620
are a lot of newcomers activities that

123
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,990
are organized at every ITF meeting so

124
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,450
before this newcomers tutorial there

125
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,300
were webinars for the newcomers and

126
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:44,250
today this is the newcomers tutorial

127
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:47,579
your hair it's from 12:30 to 1:30 the

128
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,400
next newcomers event is the IETF quick

129
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:54,410
connections that's also today at 4:00

130
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,300
p.m. it requires a pre-registration

131
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,550
there's a newcomers i.t i.t of newcomers

132
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,380
page there's a link there you can go

133
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,780
there and register yourself it's a

134
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,290
limited space event so it's better that

135
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:10,170
you register early this event is

136
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,920
basically here you'll meet the IETF

137
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:16,410
leadership so you can have it's a very

138
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,589
efficient way to meet the working group

139
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:23,459
chairs area directors mentors and other

140
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:35,220
leaders other weddings at the IETF and I

141
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:37,890
mean yes is it ok maybe closed as I told

142
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,570
it's a limited space event so probably

143
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:55,830
it's full I think you can still probably

144
00:15:42,570 --> 00:16:02,250
go that's fine I'm sure there is some

145
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:03,990
way to get in so yeah you can have short

146
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,300
one-to-one conversations with the

147
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,820
experience right here first there it

148
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,550
will be a good start of the week you can

149
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,160
ask queries if you are interested in

150
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:17,729
certain specific topic you can go ask

151
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,949
them yeah it will give you a good

152
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:24,110
kickoff for the for surviving the rest

153
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,760
of the week um and also it's not a forum

154
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,530
even there will be no speeches or

155
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,020
presentations it's a very laid-back and

156
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,770
informal event there will be beer there

157

163
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,540
earlier but now it's in so basically

164

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:06,440
already ok very few people actually I

167
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,159
would suggest highly suggest that you

168
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:13,970
should go ask for a mentor that will

169
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,160
help like it's super easy to ask

170
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,100
questions any specific questions they

171
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,430
will also guide you and guide you

172
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:25,369
through like tell you all about ITF and

173
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:28,030
guide you to how to meet new people how

174
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,530
to approach different working groups

175
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,940
working group sessions how or like which

176
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,500
working group session is happening when

177
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,050
there are several parallel tracks going

178
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,020
on at the same time and then they can

179
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:42,399
they can be very useful for answering

180
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:47,480
any questions so you should have a guide

181
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,310
assigned to yourself then there is this

182
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,820
newcomers dinner it's not an official

183
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:55,820
even it is organized by a secretariat

184
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:58,310
and you have to pay I guess 25 dollars

185
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,649
for this dinner so if you're interested

186
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,050
you can register yourself and pay for

187
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,390
this dinner it's new comers only dinner

188
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:08,570
it's also a mingling event networking

189
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,110
event you can meet with IT Affairs and

190
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,060
other newcomers here then towards the

191
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,459
end of the week that is on Thursday we

192
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,560
have an early morning newcomers feedback

193
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,290
session we are really interested in

194
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,090
knowing what you feel about all these

195
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,220
initiatives and all these activities

196
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,070
that we have organized and how did it

197
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,840
help or did not help you get through the

198
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,760
week how do you feel about it and what

199
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,159
are the other things that you would like

200
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,730
to include and that would help newcomers

201
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,590
so this is

202
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,230
important and then as Karen mentioned

203
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:45,639
there is a survey form that we would

204
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,280
like you to fill up to get the feedback

205
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:55,460
all right so this is almost about

206
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,490
newcomers activities ok so now I'm going

207
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,410
to talk about the scope of this tutorial

208
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,180
like what you should and should not

209
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,010
expect from what we are going to talk

210
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,670
about today so this presentation

211
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,350
basically is focused on providing you

212
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:12,290
with the information and resources that

213
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,689
are immediately useful to you as you are

214
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:18,320
attending your first meeting it will

215
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:21,430
give you a kickoff start a good start

216
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,689
for the meeting for this entire week and

217
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,350
we will also talk about some of the

218
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,360
strategies to how to approach people and

219
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:33,350
make new connections or whether you're

220
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,379
all of you're here in person so yeah

221
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,179
this is almost what we will talk about

222
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,510
in this meeting will also provide some

223
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,390
key some information about key people

224
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,790
and resources towards the towards the

225
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,340
end of the presentation what this

226
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:53,030
present but this is not all about IETF

227
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,189
IIT F is much much broader than what we

228
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,050
are going to talk about today in this

229
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,420
tutorial so this presentation does not

230
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,820
really include I'm not going to talk

231
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,980
about the history of the IETF or how to

232
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,010
write standards documents and the

233
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,530
process of standardization and there are

234
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,170
several other things but we will but

235
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,399
there is this link to the YouTube

236
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,350
channel where you can find more

237
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,870
information about all this all these

238
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:25,159
topics okay in the Nick any any

239
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,500
questions so far ok so in this section

240
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:31,660
now I'm going to talk about a little bit

241
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:37,100
about what IETF is and it's related

242
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:40,460
organizations and processes so first off

243
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,560
what is the mission of IETF the mission

244
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,130
of the IETF is to make the internet work

245
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,750
better by producing high-quality

246
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:51,320
relevant technical documents that

247
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,570
influence the way people design use

248
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,909
and managed the Internet so basically

249
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,399
what we are trying to do here is to

250
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:01,940
develop and maintain the standard

251
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,240
technologies to provide service and the

252
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,340
internet so we want to make sure we want

253
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:12,350
to ensure that the technology that we

254
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:14,750
provide here at IETF provides the

255
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:19,730
necessary functionality we also want to

256
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:22,550
make sure that the technology is easily

257
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,990
and efficiently deployable we also want

258
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,889
this technology we want to make sure

259
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:30,080
that the technology is scaleable at both

260
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,480
deployment as well as the usage level

261
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,090
and you also want to make sure that the

262
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,760
technology that we deploy is secure in

263
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:41,659
itself as well as the at the operational

264
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,360
level so basically the mission of IETF

265
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,510
in a nutshell is to make the internet

266
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:53,810
work better by writing high quality

267
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:55,270
internet standards documents so IETF

268
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,440
it's a standards development

269
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:01,370
organization there are several other

270
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:07,280
stos but IETF is different from these as

271
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:08,959
dioz in in a lot of aspects so IETF is

272
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,800
basically of voluntary based

273
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,590
organizations it organization it's us

274
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,780
it's a self-selected individual

275
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,780
participation there is no formal

276
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,360
membership unlike other st o--'s anybody

277
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,420
can come willingly and join and anybody

278
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,179
can go whenever they wish to another

279
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:33,260
important and very unique feature of

280
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:35,830
IETF is that to reach a consensus we do

281
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,530
not follow a formal voting procedure

282
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:42,919
what we do instead is a hum and we'll

283
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:45,649
talk about it later in this presentation

284
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,570
but unlike the important point here is

285
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,650
that unlike other standards organization

286
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,480
where voting is the main main a way of

287
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,860
reaching a consensus here we do not

288
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:00,050
believe in a formal voting process

289
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,479
additionally ITF does not have any

290
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,290
formal government or a government role

291
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,950
or any

292
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,480
private corporations rule it's a very

293
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:14,040
individual based individual

294
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,990
participation based organization another

295
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,879
important and unique factor is that the

296
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,520
standards that we develop or write here

297
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,060
are not mandated we don't mandate

298
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,850
standards on people it's mostly the

299
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,040
standardization is mostly driven by

300
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:32,520
market-based adoption so if people think

301
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,520
that a standard technology is useful

302
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,080
they would read it they would deploy it

303
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
and see if it works and that's how a

304
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,439
specification becomes a standard when

305
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,100
people actually think that it is useful

306
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,320
and it is deployed so that's how it's

307
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,000
kind of a Bottoms Up approach as opposed

308
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,889
to going from standardization to

309
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,230
adoption we believe in going from

310
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:02,670
adoption to standardization so it's a

311
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:05,870
very market adoption based process at

312
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,310
ITF we are primarily focused on

313
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,800
improving the internet working on

314
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,720
internet technologies that is where the

315
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,520
focuses and that is where we think our

316
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,740
expertise is as opposed to other

317
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,300
organisations where where they are

318
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,230
involved with several other things like

319
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,419
other processes and parts of Internet

320
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,600
are improving the internet but here at

321
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,130
ITF our Cole focuses on working on the

322
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,310
Internet technologies that provide

323
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:34,770
service and as I said this is a very

324
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,620
Bottoms Up approach as opposed to a

325
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:44,250
top-down approach which is pretty unique

326
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:46,439
compared to other stos all right so this

327
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,060
is really interesting if you're in here

328
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,100
for technology then you should

329
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,730
definitely look at these the slide and

330
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,699
dig deeper into all these areas so the

331
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,000
work of IETF is organized into working

332
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,390
groups the those are the workhorse of

333
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,420
IETF you can say and ITF groups these

334
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:09,990
working groups into these groups all

335
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:14,040
right so there are currently seven areas

336
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:18,090
broad areas and the working groups fall

337
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:21,510
under one of these areas these areas are

338
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:23,879
mostly dynamic we formed one if we feel

339
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,580
we need another area and we can collapse

340
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,090
one if we don't need anymore working

341
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,770
groups under that area so currently

342
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,139
there are these seven working groups

343
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll not get into details of these

344
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,840
groups but the names are a pretty

345
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,440
self-explanatory each of these areas

346
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,770
have one or two area directors who take

347
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,309
care of coordination between the working

348
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:52,168
groups that are a part of these areas

349
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:54,539
and see if they are performing the

350
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:57,000
necessary functions that are required

351
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,850
for a particular working group or these

352
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,470
area directors are appointed by NomCom

353
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,870
that is the nomination committee um

354
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,679
typically for a period of two years so

355
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:09,779
the area directors take care of these

356
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,149
areas and then under these areas there

357
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,429
are working groups which are specific to

358
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:15,840
some specific problem that they're

359
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:20,159
trying to solve in the internet and

360
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,470
these working groups have chairs who are

361
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:30,570
present here in person and then they

362
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:33,149
organize working groups at the IETF okay

363
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,340
so the IETF in consensus this is a very

364
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:38,639
very unique feature here at IETF as I

365
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,459
said IETF does not believe in a majority

366
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,520
rule philosophy so the IETF mantra we

367
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,590
reject Kings precedents and voting we

368
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,250
believe in rough consensus and running

369
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:52,500
code so how do we achieve rough

370
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,210
consensus as I said voting is one option

371
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,520
but that doesn't really resonate well

372
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,429
with the idea of the mantra of IETF and

373
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,639
the people here so whenever I'm in a

374
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:05,250
working group session the working group

375
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,049
chair wants to know the temperature of

376
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,350
the room on a certain topic or how many

377
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:12,570
people agree to something or disagree

378
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,059
what they usually do is instead of a

379
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:19,139
show of hands or on a voting process

380
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:25,830
they ask people in the room to hum like

381
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:28,020
hmm for or against a topic and when

382
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:31,918
people do that

383
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:38,149
the working group chair is responsible

384
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:41,880
for judging basically the the weight of

385
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:45,709
yes or no it doesn't tell anything

386
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:49,289
unequivocally like what is the real

387
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,000
decision but it just gives an idea of

388
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:53,070
where on the spectrum of completely

389
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,169
acceptable - completely unacceptable

390
00:27:53,070 --> 00:28:00,090
people in the room are it's really

391
00:27:55,169 --> 00:28:01,830
interesting so then yeah so then the

392
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,780
working group chair is responsible for

393
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,449
deciding whether we are going for or

394
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:10,080
against and it's not decided on the spot

395
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,149
like this decision is then taking this

396
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,918
issue or topic is then taken over to the

397
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:16,260
mailing list and it has continued there

398
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,780
this is this is basically to accommodate

399
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,539
those people who could not attend the

400
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,760
who were not present there in person and

401
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:26,940
then the whole process not the humming

402
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,658
but the entire discussion is taken to

403
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:35,580
the mailing list and then we reach on

404
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:39,419
judgement so that's that's the way how

405
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,129
we reach rough consensus and there's

406
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,720
this really interesting if you're

407
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,539
interested we should go read

408
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,970
RFC seven - eight - that describes whole

409
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,639
history of why we follow and how it all

410
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:53,010
started the humming process another

411
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:55,289
important thing is that about rough

412
00:28:53,010 --> 00:29:00,059
consensus is that everybody's voice is

413
00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:02,908
heard and addressed but not necessarily

414
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:05,850
accommodated so not one person's

415
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:09,919
dissenting opinion can control reaching

416
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,918
us a judgement it's a rough consensus

417
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,959
okay

418
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:20,039
let's talk a little bit about IETF

419
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:23,279
culture as I said it's a very it's an

420
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,590
individual voluntary based participation

421
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,380
so the people who are here are very very

422
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:31,080
passionate and they are motivated and

423
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,539
self driven they're smart people they

424
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,178
are very vocal about their opinions so

425
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:39,270
if you hear people in the hallway

426
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,860
yelling at each other don't get scared

427
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,990
it's just the way they are they are

428
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,270
trying to reach reach

429
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,850
a good solution trying to hear each

430
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,010
other also I should keep in mind that

431
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,409
these people some of these people have

432
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,970
been coming to these ideas for like last

433
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,380
20 years they know each other really

434
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,960
well they know how to talk to each other

435
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,000
they know their ways so don't get scared

436
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,160
of if you are if you want to if you're

437
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,970
interested in talking to someone just go

438
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:09,190
there introduce yourself talk to them

439
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,330
it'll be all fine you'll be accommodated

440
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,610
don't worry about it

441
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,620
another thing is technically technical

442
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,419
excellence and topical knowledge is

443
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,590
highly valued so I would suggest if you

444
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,110
are attending some working group

445
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,679
sessions make sure that you have read

446
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:26,500
the relevant documents and if you say

447
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,060
something smart and technical people

448
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,800
would you know you you'll be

449
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:35,980
accommodated you'll be you'll be heard

450
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:39,070
and that says a lot about ITF culture we

451
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:42,390
are very it's it's it's pretty informal

452
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:45,399
like it's very friendly

453
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,070
just like ITF culture the dress code is

454
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,100
also very informal people mostly here

455
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,500
like to wear t-shirts though I'm in a

456
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,260
little bit of formal attire here today

457
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,390
that's not how I am normally but if

458
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,190
that's your way go for it whatever you

459
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:04,470
want to do you wanna wear informal

460
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:07,570
formal it's it's all acceptable there

461
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:09,190
yeah and as I said people have been

462
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,139
coming here for a very long time they

463
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,180
have closed working relationships with

464
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,310
each other and people know each other

465
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,510
very well at both personal as well as

466
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:24,730
professional level so it's it's a very

467
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:28,150
very friendly environment yes okay this

468
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:30,970
is yes this is interesting so as a

469
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:34,450
newcomer here in this week you are going

470
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:36,820
to get a lot of acronyms I would suggest

471
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,890
do not pay attention too much attention

472
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,990
to all of them a little bit is fine if

473
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,720
you are working if you are interested in

474
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:46,210
the mostly interested in the technical

475
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,340
thing the slide previous slide on the

476
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:53,020
technical areas you should dig deeper

477
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,540
into it and these these will we'll get

478
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,460
these different working and moving parts

479
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,820
of IETF that makes

480
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:03,840
this entire organization work gradually

481
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,039
as you start attending more meetings and

482
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,639
getting more involved in the

483
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:12,690
administrative stuff but just to give

484
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,760
you an overview about different

485
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:19,360
different moving parts of ITF there are

486
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:24,029
several groups the first one here is

487
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,678
iesg internet Engineering steering group

488
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:30,159
this group is basically for the

489
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:34,120
technical administration of the IETF it

490
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,779
is also the one finally approves the

491
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:43,479
specifications to becoming the RFC

492
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:47,610
standards then there is IRT F internet

493
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,440
research task force this organization is

494
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:54,100
this group is basically focused on

495
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,799
longer-term research areas research

496
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,529
topics in the Internet as opposed to its

497
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,470
parallel organization IETF which is

498
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:03,370
focused more on the immediate

499
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,460
engineering and standardization

500
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,070
processes so I RTF is more research

501
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,200
long-term research focus groups for

502
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,870
instance there is CFR G group that is

503
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,510
the crypto forum research group that

504
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:19,059
provides guidelines on the adoption of

505
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:21,279
emerging crypto technologies then there

506
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:24,580
is really interesting HPRC which is the

507
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:28,559
HR PC that's human rights protocol

508
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:31,480
consideration group which considers how

509
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:36,720
standards and protocols that we develop

510
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:39,940
here could could enable strengthen or

511
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,549
weaken human rights if you are

512
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,409
interested in that kind of stuff you

513
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,658
should go attend I think the meeting is

514
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:48,220
on Friday it's really interesting and

515
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:52,330
apart from these there are several other

516
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,640
research groups that are not all of the

517
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,889
research group meetings happen every

518
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:02,820
IETF but a few of subset of them sure

519
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:05,620
happen at different IETF meetings

520
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,899
throughout the year then there is this

521
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,339
internet architecture board that

522
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:14,730
provides an oversight for the technical

523
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:20,300
technical requirements of the end of the

524
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:25,199
internet so they're also involved in

525
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:26,909
writing RFC's and standards the internet

526
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,000
architecture board recently there was a

527
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:33,260
workshop organized by I'm not sure if it

528
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,690
was organized by Ivy via web packaging

529
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:44,300
yes so yeah so yeah there was this with

530
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:47,940
packaging workshop organized by IAB and

531
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,560
the IETF LLC as the name suggests it's

532
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:55,260
mostly involved with the administrative

533
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:57,540
and management work at ITF you can read

534
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,390
more about it there are resources

535
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,700
available if you're interested in

536
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:06,330
getting more insight into how the

537
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:11,149
administration of ITF works but for now

538
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:11,150
don't get lost into this alphabet soup

539
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,920
okay so this was the slide that I was

540
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:22,760
talking about basically wealth you

541
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,760
continue okay thank you

542
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,980
okay I'm gonna talk about the week that

543
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,000
started yesterday continuing through

544
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:41,130
today and running until Friday this is

545
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,500
sort of the most pragmatic advice the

546
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:46,680
agenda you if you've already stirred

547
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,560
you've gotten a copy either you know

548
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:53,009
links on links online to be agenda there

549
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:57,120
is also an agenda app for Android and

550
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:59,820
iPhone sometimes they have little

551
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,279
printouts and fan-fold paper that are

552
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,290
worth doing they're about a hundred and

553
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,350
thirty working groups in the IETF is on

554
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:10,040
Tom mentioned they are the unit of work

555
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,330
within the ITF the people that do things

556
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,029
about eighty of them are meeting this

557
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:17,700
week there's also what's called birds of

558
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,230
a feather from the English American

559
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,910
phrase birds of a feather flock together

560
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:26,010
meeting like-minded individuals and

561
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,810
these this is the step of before an

562
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,430
actual working group is formed so

563
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,900
there'll be announcements and there are

564
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,730
announcements and things are in the

565
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,260
agenda about offs for various topics

566
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,530
they may be it's called working group

567
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,090
forming meaning meaning the intent is we

568
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,310
want to end up with a working group that

569
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,440
then has to get approved by the area

570
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,670
directors or we just want to get

571
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,580
together and see if there's interest

572
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,300
they both might meet once or twice for

573
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:56,640
example and our W o the IRT F is meeting

574
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,740
also on there's about fifteen sessions

575
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,950
it's actually you can consider it to be

576
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,910
part of the IETF meetings there in the

577
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:09,600
agenda you can just go and show up there

578
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:12,149
a lot of the terminology and workflow is

579
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,710
very similar instead of talking about a

580
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,200
working group there's a research group

581
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:19,200
instead of talking about an internet

582
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,140
draft or an RFC there's research

583
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,790
documents there's actual mentions some

584
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,060
of them are very focused on sort of

585
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:29,509
being the advanced R&D group of the IETF

586
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,850
and some are focused on being more

587
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:34,380
social oriented there's one for example

588
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,230
the largest-scale what I know of is

589
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,240
called global access to the internet for

590
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:44,319
all Gaia how do we get the Internet

591
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,078
everywhere there's the applied

592
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:50,290
networking research group this is an

593
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,520
eighth ACM affiliated organization it's

594
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,589
meeting all day tomorrow

595
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,109
I think registration is still open for

596
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:58,509
that it obviously conflicts with working

597
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,000
group meetings that are tomorrow like to

598
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,950
that I'm chairing so I can't go

599
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,920
unfortunately um there is also plenary

600
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,359
x' to this year one right after the

601
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,059
other a technical one and the

602
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,410
administrative one the paper-pushing

603
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:13,960
there's an invited lunch talks

604
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,790
there's the tutorial program which

605
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,680
you're part of here there's a follow on

606
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:20,349
another tutorial about how to write

607
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,480
security considerations about thirty

608
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:25,900
minutes after this one there's a social

609
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,690
event there's a mailing list for IETF

610
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,869
105 attendees you're probably registered

611
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:35,020
you may have signed up or not signed up

612
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:37,300
for that list one of the most common

613
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,150
uses of the mailing list is hey does

614
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,730
anybody have a spare social ticket

615
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,950
especially as it gets close to the event

616
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,890
there's a hot RFC which is requests for

617
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,740
comments or rest requests for

618
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,150
conversation this people say well I

619
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,189
don't even know if this is a working

620
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,720
group idea but here is you know some

621
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,980
research that I've been working on or

622
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,959
something I've been thinking about they

623
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,240
talk for 10 minutes and see maybe

624
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,270
there's interest I've had a number of

625
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,910
people I volunteered them from the hot

626
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:10,210
RFC to come talk it's a acne or other

627
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:12,759
working groups we're trying an

628
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,010
experiment with this meeting the first

629
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,770
hour of every day is set aside for side

630
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,079
meetings one of those I guess is the

631
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,059
newcomers debriefing although that's

632
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,319
before the side meeting just to get

633
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,109
together and talk with people that

634
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:31,480
you've met during the week and so on

635
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:35,680
oh yes yeah comes later there's also -

636
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:40,780
Tuesday Monday Monday morning is the ITF

637
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,640
sisters breakfast you can see at 8 you

638
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,500
can see I'm told to sign up for that if

639
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,660
you want anybody who identifies as

640
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,270
female is welcome to come to that it's a

641
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,460
support organization for women within

642
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:54,270
the ITF and there's a slide in the

643
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,270
picture coming up

644
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,770
there's a lot of activities not on the

645
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,740
agenda hallway meetings bar boss that's

646
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,240
where it's like hey let's go talk about

647
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,189
network disk drive access things like

648
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,930
Dropbox and Google Drive and so on and

649
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,970
they go off to a bar and talk right

650
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,190
marathon editing sessions we're trying

651
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,020
to resolve some nasty issues that the

652
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,940
working group is identified we'll just

653
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,170
get together in a closed room or you

654
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,300
know there's little breakout rooms

655
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,570
throughout and do that we have an app

656
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,340
the agenda as I mentioned working group

657
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,170
sessions are the main point that sort of

658
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:28,290
the justification why most of us are

659
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,450
here not everybody about most of us work

660
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:33,779
is officially the ITF work is officially

661
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:36,689
done on mailing lists the meetings

662
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,280
face-to-face are to talk about what's

663
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:40,680
happened since the last face-to-face

664
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,220
meeting what the open issues are the

665
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,259
quick no the h2 one of those two working

666
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,209
groups for example is only about issues

667
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,720
there's no new work being discussed

668
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,010
that's what their agenda says the

669
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,990
sessions are all streamed and recorded

670
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,780
this session is being streamed and

671
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:01,560
recorded as well fine folks in the back

672
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,510
of the room so you can always it's often

673
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,490
worthwhile this usually unavoidable

674
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,780
conflicts I really wanted to go to this

675
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,930
and that but they're meeting at the same

676
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:15,230
time shortly after the ITF meeting go to

677
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:18,919
the IETF YouTube channel on YouTube and

678
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:21,960
watch the meeting that you didn't see

679
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,119
birds of a feather I mentioned here is

680
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,070
opposed to session summon presenting at

681
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,339
the reception for their birds of a

682
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:33,359
feather acme the certificate let's

683
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:35,670
encrypt certificate protocol now does 10

684
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,500
million certificates a year and it

685
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,730
started you know it started up and then

686
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,470
there was a buff and then it was a

687
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:44,580
working group and the RFC was published

688
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:47,669
six months ago so they can be very

689
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:50,190
successful i RTF it's officially part of

690
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,260
one of these alphabet soup organizations

691
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:56,280
at Chantal pointed to that's not oh

692
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:59,640
sorry I'm child pointed to I got up very

693
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,870
early this morning um sorry

694
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:06,870
sorry there's a RFC primer on the

695
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:09,330
difference between the IETF and the IRT

696
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:12,270
F as I said they share on purpose a lot

697
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:16,160
of similar terminology and they're

698
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:19,500
hosted by the same parent organization

699
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,779
applied networking research it's a forum

700
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,400
for you know academics this is how we

701
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,260
bring are starting to bring more

702
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,710
academic involvement and participation

703
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:33,380
in the eye into the IETF there is also

704
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:36,840
the I applied networking research prize

705
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:39,570
it includes a free trip to the ITF and I

706
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,720
think $1,000 for the best engineering

707
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,760
paper networking paper presented in the

708
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,649
past year and that will be presented I

709
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:54,210
guess at the plenary plenary is a Latin

710
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:55,800
word it means everybody so this is what

711
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,330
the plenary looks like it'll be held and

712
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,940
the group or me held in the grand

713
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:02,520
ballroom the same one that the reception

714
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,460
is in is that they assess the front and

715
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,280
the various leadership teams will cycle

716
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,320
through that I'm on the IAB you got any

717
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,590
questions with the IAB ok next I'm in

718
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,000
the iesg any questions ok next I'm the

719
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:19,080
executive director here's what our

720
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,090
budget looks like next its nitty-gritty

721
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,720
details about how the organization works

722
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:26,880
this year there's also a separate

723
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,459
co-located just before technical plenary

724
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,740
and I don't recall what the topic is but

725
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,750
worthwhile nothing else is scheduled

726
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,919
against the plenaries invited lunch to

727
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:39,750
talk the sponsor in this case

728
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,020
nbc/universal comcast comcast

729
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:45,300
nbc/universal whatever their thing is

730
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,740
they will have a speaker I think on

731
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:52,110
Thursday hackathons and code sprints so

732
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,870
the first time you haven't missed it you

733
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:58,650
sort of missed it now the code sprint is

734
00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:01,680
we're on Saturdays we're smaller group

735
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,690
of people develop the website that

736
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,020
powers all of the workflow for

737
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:09,570
generating RFC's hackathons are for

738
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,400
people just want to get together and

739
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,780
discuss you know and work on their

740
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,530
implementation make sure they

741
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,590
interoperate

742
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,350
notable successes have been quick TLS

743
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:25,020
one three right now we're doing teep and

744
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:26,640
some DNS work at later on in the week

745
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,710
there'll be a hackathon happy hour will

746
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,680
they'll be a presentation from some of

747
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,450
the more successful things in the future

748
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,770
it's sort of freeze its separate

749
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:39,810
registration they provide nice lunch

750
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,790
table space and you can just sign up on

751
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:45,630
a wiki for things you are interested in

752
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:47,370
working on to the next ITF next ITF is

753
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,730

day skimming over the doctor you know

768
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:35,730
the drafts that you want for the

769
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,710
meetings you want to attend all the way

770
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,960
through you know lunk there's a break

771
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,520
there's lunch there's dinner sometimes

772
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,160
there's a session after dinner that's

773
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,920
often the plenary for example and then

774
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,319
you get together often not quite get

775
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,570
together with friends colleagues people

776
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,450
you just met earlier in the day to have

777
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:58,160
after-dinner beer drink go out and

778
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:02,669
socialize or more likely go out and work

779
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,460
it is a long day there are lots of

780
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:09,120
things going on and which brings me to

781
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:11,010
the last bullet on this slide remember

782
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,650
sleep it's tiring by the end of the week

783
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,600
as tired as people are seeing that note

784
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,420
well slide that on shell started with

785
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:23,069
you'll see it at every single session as

786
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:26,550
a reminder don't talk about private

787
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,220
patents don't harass anybody be kind to

788
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,380
your neighbor

789
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,450
the note well stuff they'll be even more

790
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,160
tired just you know ready to crash out

791
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,220
on the flights or driving on the way

792
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,500
home how are you at home a few key

793
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,790
points about etiquette we want to be

794
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:45,550
respectful and tolerant towards

795
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:49,730
everybody the ITF started as a u.s.

796
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:51,829
contracted kind of thing it has since

797
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:54,250
grown to be global we are deliberately

798
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:57,800
for example we need once in the US

799
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,690
hemisphere once in Europe in March we

800
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,960
were in Prague last March and then once

801
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:05,780
in Asia so it's 1 1 1 to get global

802
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,630
participation we try to make sure that

803
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,940
people who can't attend in person are

804
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:16,010
able to participate such as streaming

805
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:17,839
and YouTube videos also we have

806
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:20,300
something called Medeco which is a great

807
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:25,160
service where people can participate

808
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:26,660
remotely or just listening remotely so

809
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,540
we've had remote presenters we will

810
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,670
present on often on a topic they just

811
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:35,119
can't make it to wherever the meeting

812
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,920
happens to be talked and listen

813
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,550
listening is obviously more important

814
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,900
than talking bringing new work to the

815
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:49,339
ITF we're trying to encourage this

816
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:51,170
except maybe watching that's a joke find

817
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:53,480
the way to do it if you have an idea

818
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,730
that you think might be useful to help

819
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,849
the internet work better that's a very

820
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:01,609
broad umbrella on purpose find some

821
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:03,829
collaborators good ways you know this is

822
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:05,420
kind of related working group so let me

823
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:07,010
go specialize that when you talk to the

824
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,500
working group chair see if they think

825
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,240
it's interesting let me put a note near

826
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,680
the schedules paper schedules that are

827
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,410
printed in the registration area

828
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,868
I guess down that way um just get a

829
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:20,118
bunch of people together post on the

830
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:22,730
IETF 105 attendees list hey I want to

831
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:25,640
talk about you know ways to use DNS to

832
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:28,099
find my phone whatever it's gonna be you

833
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,299
hold it you propose a bath that's you're

834
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:32,089
starting to get into more formal

835
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,710
structure there is tutorial from a

836
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:37,849
couple meetings ago on how to bring new

837
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:40,270
work to the IETF the slides are

838
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:42,700
available there's also a video of that

839
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:45,490
patient so just because there's things

840
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,859
used it's a good vibrant technical

841
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:51,819
community always eager to get involved

842
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:55,720
in more areas the way working groups

843
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:58,510
work so the rules will all be set up

844
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,160
like this they'll be at the table will

845
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,990
be the working group chairs their

846
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,480
primary responsibility is time

847
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,839
management for example I can tell you

848
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,880
right now we're gonna run long they

849
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,340
could they coordinate the speakers have

850
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,690
set up the agenda and all of the slides

851
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:20,230
before the meeting the speaker's stand

852
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:22,570
here in this case there's a pink X to

853
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,580
make sure that the video cameras are you

854
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,590
know can record you if you step off

855
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:30,069
camera it's uncomfortable to the people

856
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:32,080
remote and to the video um there's a

857
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:34,390
microphone this is a smaller room so

858
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:38,940
there's one with the plenary there are

859
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:43,420
six or eight a bigger meeting such as

860
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:45,790
TLS or DNS we'll have two mics and you

861
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,460
know the rooms will be almost half again

862
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:51,250
or twice this size if you want to say

863
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,860
something you say you come up to the mic

864
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,330
and there's a line and the chair will

865
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,840
say you know next to the line you say

866
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:59,110
your name

867
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,640
Rick Saul's for identification you say

868
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,490
your company your affiliation rich

869
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,980
Saul's Akamai and I think and then you

870
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,959
say what your point is if it's directly

871
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,020
addressing a presenter you know I think

872
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,750
that the extension you wrote there could

873
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:17,170
be better improved by doing this and

874
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:19,210
that's it there are blue sheets which

875
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,500
will go around on those done at the

876
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:21,790
beginning of the meeting collected at

877
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,300
the end of the meeting you write your

878
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:27,580
name your affiliation those are scanned

879
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,400
and posted and put online so we have a

880
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,380
record of all the attendees again that's

881
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,720
to ensure compliance with you know make

882
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,980
sure there's no submarine patent work

883
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,640
going on we've been pretty good about

884
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:41,740
that and also to help plan in the future

885
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,569
meeting well you know the chairs they go

886
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,459
oh well I've got 75 people and want to

887
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,810
come to my next meeting and we can look

888
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,700
at the blue sheets and go really you

889
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,970
only have 20 the last three so maybe

890
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,410
we'll give you a smaller room any kind

891
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,980
of technical comment and questions are

892
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,020
discussed

893
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,160
well somebody is presenting someone can

894
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,840
come up to a mic and say I have a

895
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,190
clarifying question I didn't understand

896
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,460
what you just said that that and then

897
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:05,980
details about what your confusion was

898
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,310
there is a jabber when we talk about the

899
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:11,500
resources I'm cha will mention that

900
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:13,930
instant messaging protocol there's

901
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,600
always a jabber room available always a

902
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:19,089
jab room open for people put in

903
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:22,330
questions and comments and also to keep

904
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:23,950
track of what the slides are with that

905
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,790
I'll turn it back over to Chantal

906
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,290
Melissa

907
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:37,450
someone has a question on what I just

908
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:38,950
talked about for this week great ok I'll

909
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:42,640
try to bring it on time which means I

910
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:44,830
will talk even faster there's a person

911
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,440
associated with the ITF called Eric

912
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:52,420
named Eric Rescorla he's often called by

913
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:55,650
his initials ecker ekr and his speaking

914
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:58,119
style is the unit of speed for speaking

915
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:00,760
so people say oh I speak at half a

916
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:03,490
Necker or I can speak it you know a

917
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,900
point-9 of a Necker um and he speaks

918
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,520
really really quickly and he's very

919
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:09,670
technical and it's really hard sometimes

920
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:13,000
to understand him don't worry you're not

921
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:14,920
alone but anyhow I will speak a little

922
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,920
quicker to try to get us to finish close

923
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:21,130
to time the Secretariat are the key

924
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,840
resources for this week the lovely

925
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:25,600
people in shirts I think they're all

926
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,280
women they are the ones who handle the

927
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,618
logistics when we couldn't figure out

928
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,240
how to get the slides projected here

929
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:34,420
right somebody in the blue shirt who

930
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,680
came up they handle the registration

931
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,260
they handle all the paperwork the

932
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,299
coordination of everything they collect

933
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,340
the blue sheets scan them you know after

934
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,960
the meeting and so on

935
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:48,100
lovely people we couldn't do this week

936
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,330
without them also noticeable on Friday

937
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,100
is we're starting to take down

938
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,150
everything or they're starting to take

939
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,690
down everything they changed the

940
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,690
Hawaiian shirts

941
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:03,460
RFC editor there are two tables out by

942
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:05,890
the up either in the registration area

943
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,820
one is for the RFC editor those are the

944
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:10,460
people who copy edit and actually

945
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:14,240
Publishing of the documents once they've

946
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:15,950
been approved by the isg having left the

947
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,379
working group having been written by the

948
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:21,410
working group authors so that's the

949
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:23,210
workflow the RSC editor and then there's

950
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:26,690
I Anna the internet assigned numbers

951
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:29,990
Authority that ensures for example that

952
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:33,920
DNS uses port 53 and nobody else does

953
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:35,990
then - HTTP uses port 443 and nobody

954
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,790
else does there's a whole bunch of

955
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,859
number spaces that have to be managed

956
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,779
and assigned some of the numbers have

957
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,870
names

958
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:46,550
so I Anna handles all of that other

959
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,109
notable thing about these two

960
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,640
organizations outside of their being

961
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:53,300
friendly and some are paid and some are

962
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,830
volunteers they always have candy out so

963
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,900
if you need a quick pick-me-up

964
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,900
hi know I love the job you're doing

965
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:07,010
Portia Irwin Stanley is our interim

966
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,810
executive director the IETF recently

967
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:12,560
went through a slight reorganization for

968
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:14,270
legal purposes to form a legal entity as

969
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,570
opposed to being this sort of amorphous

970
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:20,060
thing guiding through that is Ben Portia

971
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:24,020
who is the executive director you know

972
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:28,340
signs the checks keeps the lights on the

973
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:32,380
Ombuds team the IETF has a very strict

974
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:36,530
no harassment policy nobody should feel

975
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:38,780
harassed bothered constrained from

976
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:42,410
talking constrained from giving their

977
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:44,390
technical opinion similarly you should

978
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:46,399
feel constrained from insulting the way

979
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,589
somebody looks or commenting on them or

980
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,830
saying you know I think you're really

981
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:54,680
stupid no you can say that idea isn't

982
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:57,170
good and here's why but don't you know

983
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,529
obviously we know how to act like mature

984
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:03,410
adults towards each other um a hard part

985
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:05,090
of this is as I mentioned many of these

986
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,930
people have known each other for years

987
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:12,290
or decades so somebody will stand up you

988
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:15,290
know Barry Lebowitz tanned up and go you

989
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:16,700
know that's really dumb of you Mike or

990
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,830
Mike will say that's a really stupid

991
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,540
conclusion you have to separate

992
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:22,130
sometimes from the people if they look

993
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:24,680
middle-aged us

994
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:29,509
beards they've been around for a long

995
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:32,419
time I'm not middle-aged we have a team

996
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:35,839
of Ombudsman there's a policy about it

997
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,279
um but the Ombuds team there is anti

998
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,680
harassment policy there's pictures of

999
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:40,940
the people involved all three of them

1000
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,269
are very long time

1001
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:48,529
ITF participants if you see anything and

1002
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:50,720
they have a particular sticker on its a

1003
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:53,809
green tag at the bottom of there's no

1004
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,569
neon green go up and and the think will

1005
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:59,239
handle things appropriately and so on on

1006
00:55:56,569 --> 00:56:00,769
mailing lists we have a organization

1007
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:03,200
called the sergeant of arms who has

1008
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:05,269
occasionally stepped in recently to try

1009
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:10,308
to make sure that this course is civil

1010
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:11,508
mature and respectful who's who working

1011
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:12,950
group chairs those are the people as I

1012
00:56:11,509 --> 00:56:15,859
said who will sit at the front and

1013
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:16,879
handle all things a blue button like

1014
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:18,859
that on their badge

1015
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,239
sometimes the other important thing is

1016
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:22,460
the smiley face

1017
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,229
that's a sticker anybody can put on and

1018
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:27,170
it means I am willing to answer

1019
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:29,538
questions about the ITF obviously on

1020
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,729
trial and I are up here to help

1021
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:34,609
introduce you and we're willing to

1022
00:56:31,729 --> 00:56:37,009
answer questions about the ITF so later

1023
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:40,130
this evening when there is the Welcome

1024
00:56:37,009 --> 00:56:41,839
Reception for everyone as you're

1025
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,400
wandering around with you know plate of

1026
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,259
hors d'oeuvres and stacks or whatever it

1027
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,210
is and you have a question look you can

1028
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:50,719
look for somebody or you might recognize

1029
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:54,430
a familiar face do ask questions we want

1030
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:57,890
people to come learn contribute and not

1031
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:59,779
leave we want to keep you here and it's

1032
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:02,118
not because we make money right and the

1033
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:04,670
the way to you can participate purely by

1034
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:06,469
joining mailing lists and doesn't cost

1035
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:09,549
anything except some time and you know

1036
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:14,749
mental work to join the mailing list

1037
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:16,819
some resources the DAO of the ITF no

1038
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:19,160
disrespect intended to the Buddhists it

1039
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:21,499
was named chosen deliberately describes

1040
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:24,259
sort of the philosophical underpinnings

1041
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:28,249
of the organization as an Chell talked

1042
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:32,539
about we are unlike many other standards

1043
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:34,368
organizations ISO ITU has one vote per

1044
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:35,690
country and the national standards

1045
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:39,349
organization ANSI

1046
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:41,300
psi dot forget what you know and so on

1047
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:43,460
they pick who their representatives are

1048
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,369
gonna be anybody you can join the

1049
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:48,020
mailing list anybody gets an equal say

1050
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:50,270
there's a specific newcomers page for

1051
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:52,910
this IETF and they were also the

1052
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:54,859
tutorials are all available not just the

1053
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:56,390
newcomers but going back in time as we

1054
00:57:54,859 --> 00:58:01,690
said how to write how to bring new work

1055
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:04,490
in how to write an RFC and so on

1056
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:07,550
get more meeting resources all of these

1057
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:11,328
are available in slides which are on the

1058
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:15,319
data tracker next slide

1059
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:19,869
data tracker that IETF Torg or or DTI

1060
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:22,779
ETS org um this is the website that is

1061
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:25,339
manages all of the document workflow

1062
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,950
everything we do goes through the data

1063
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:30,230
tracker so every working group every

1064
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,598
team which isn't quite a working group

1065
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:34,940
as Karen mentioned at the beginning the

1066
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:39,470
AG team that people who do this there's

1067
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:41,900
an RFC team who handle the defining that

1068
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:44,720
the content not the content but defining

1069
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:48,230
the style and markup of the RFC's they

1070
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,480
all have pages on here the most common

1071
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:53,690
thing I type is DT that I 80 after Doric

1072
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,420
/wg for a working group slash and then

1073
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:59,300
what the working groups abbreviation is

1074
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:01,760
the IETF is fond perhaps overly fond of

1075
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:06,230
having coming up with pronounceable

1076
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:10,790
English kind of pseudo words right lurk

1077
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:13,670
t DNS up about that Tia quick and so on

1078
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:19,099
so um but that's a way to find and from

1079
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:20,270
there as you see on the right-hand that

1080
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:23,859
works so you see on the right-hand side

1081
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:27,200
over there that is a working group page

1082
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:28,609
it shows all of the doc all of the

1083
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,040
drafts that are currently in progress

1084
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:33,049
what their state is sometimes they're

1085
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,230
waiting for the area director and the

1086
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:39,079
isg to move them forward tabs across the

1087
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:41,960
top overview the of the working group

1088
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:44,540
that documents the mailing lists from

1089
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:47,089
the website you can join any number of

1090
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:49,370
the I call the ITF mailing lists are on

1091
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:51,170
data tracker dot IETF that org

1092
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:53,180
the tools is once you start to get

1093
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,430
involved in writing RFC's then you may

1094
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:58,460
care about the tools but for now don't

1095
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:01,819
bother the data tracker is your friend

1096
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:07,100
or the bane of your existence remote

1097
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:09,170
participation attendance is not required

1098
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,819
the only time attendance is required is

1099
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:12,680
if you want to participate in the

1100
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,500
nominating committee or be selected for

1101
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:18,379
the nominating committee we support

1102
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:20,210
remote attendance for at all of the

1103
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,640
working group sessions many of the other

1104
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:26,390
sessions like I said that this tutorial

1105
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:29,089
the these side meetings are not remotely

1106
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:31,009
they'll available and we have a team

1107
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:35,540
medic oh those are the people we'll find

1108
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:37,280
folks on the Medeco team very friendly

1109
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,590
and helpful there's always a video AV

1110
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,840
person in the back of the room handling

1111
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:47,150
the screaming the mics and so on the

1112
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:50,020
network if you haven't logged into the

1113
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:53,120
ITF network yet it is a thing of wonder

1114
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:54,830
people arrive about a week early they

1115
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,440
bring in all sorts of you know working

1116
01:00:54,830 --> 01:01:01,540
with the local telecom company they

1117
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:04,460
bring in all sorts of extra capacity

1118
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:06,910
there are a number of IETF networks

1119
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:11,330
depending on whether you do you know

1120
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:14,720
ipv6 ipv4 ipv6 and for forum six legacy

1121
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:16,670
whatever it's going to be for all of the

1122
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,080
ones that require a name and password

1123
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:22,570
the name and password

1124
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:26,330
IETF the purpose of that is not to be

1125
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:28,190
prevent people from getting access to

1126
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:30,410
the network it's to make sure that we

1127
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,240
can do encryption right you log into the

1128
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:34,910
network and then you get keys and so on

1129
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,029
we try to avoid you know there was a big

1130
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:40,220
RFC published shortly after Edward

1131
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:42,860
Snowden that says surveillance is a

1132
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,770
threat um that we need to mitigate so we

1133
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:47,330
try to move everyone towards encryption

1134
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:49,970
funny story when I was walking around I

1135
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:52,279
guess down the underground shopping

1136
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,350
center things some of those I don't know

1137
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:58,220
what this is hotel is or where it is but

1138
01:01:54,350 --> 01:02:00,170
boy do they have great internet it

1139
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,540
really is amazing and it will run

1140
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:04,720
through Friday through the end of the

1141
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,720
session

1142
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:09,440
there's a quiet space there's a terminal

1143
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,830
room it doesn't have terminals anymore

1144
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,560
it just has wired power cords and wired

1145
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:16,880
Ethernet there's a printer if you need

1146
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,880
to print your boarding pass or a

1147
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:22,220
last-minute document it's now out by the

1148
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,470
registration area so that you can just

1149
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:28,879
