1
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,660
yeah alright everyone welcome to PIM

2
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,340
Mike could not be here today he's

3
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:03,830
helping out remotely are you there mark

4
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:06,229
Mike hello yep yeah so I'll try to share

5
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,090
this but Mike will jump in when when

6
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,990
they can and he'll also your

7
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,990
presentation later

8
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,600
so this is our yeah actually before we

9
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,299
start we need a minute taker and one

10
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,250
willing to take minutes you don't have

11
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,530
to take like detailed minutes just like

12
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,900
what decisions are made and how many

13
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,970
people are voting for what when we have

14
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,970
to do any worse thing

15
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:45,799
okay I have to try - okay great okay

16
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,209
thank you

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,910
I'll try to take notes while you are

18
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,480
with something so okay thank you that's

19
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,420
great

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,760
all right then it can get started so

21
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,000
this is the note well that you should

22
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,440
all have seen before and we did if you

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:22,200
haven't also send out the pass of the

24
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:26,640
blue sheets here okay so this is our

25
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:30,530
agenda today does that look good did I

26
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,529
miss any requests I hope not

27
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,760
you have plenty of time today is so I

28
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,459
gave everyone a few minutes extra but

29
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:45,358
we'll see you'll probably use all the

30
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:48,769
time we have all right let's get started

31
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:54,239
done so first of the agenda is Greg I'm

32
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:58,170
sorry to multi-point BFD don't wait

33
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,889
sorry I need to go through the working

34
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:05,790
group status first then they will start

35
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:10,079
on the presentations all right let's do

36
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,530
this so we have a lot of yang models the

37
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:16,350
progress is a little bit slow I should

38
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,789
say people have done a great job on the

39
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,750
drafts with your little slow at getting

40
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:23,280
them published we have two drafts now

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,620
that are in the arms he had a thirst

42
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,539
queue I think you're stuck there just

43
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,240
because you're waiting on other young

44
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:32,940
model drafts to be finished with some of

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,970
the references to other other young

46
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,310
drafts so they will go as a whole as a

47
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:43,349
group from the editor to be published so

48
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,039
that's the PIM draft on the IGMP MLB

49
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:50,440
Draft you also have two more drafts MSTP

50
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:54,460
and our MP Emily snipping

51
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,160
I was trying to get them published it

52
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,900
took some time to get everyone to

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,990
respond whether they're sending IPR and

54
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,479
stuff like that but now I got all the

55
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,300
responses on either so IPR anything so

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:14,380
I'll try to request publishing in a week

57
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:17,980
or two then we have some other drafts we

58
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:22,090
have dr log balancing publication was

59
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:24,690
requested for that alvaro or ID reviewed

60
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,150
that and had a good amount of comments

61
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:32,100
so as some of the one of the offers I

62
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,390
will try to address the comments and I

63
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,850
think they're just minor things but if

64
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,909
there's anything bigger we'll take it to

65
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,890
the to the mailing list so that you all

66
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,110
get a chance to see what's going on and

67
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:50,800
if you agree with the changes that are

68
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:53,470
being considered there's a Java before

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,530
prefix or ipv6 next hop that has been

70
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:02,590
stuck forever as one of the offers

71
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:06,309
that's mainly my fault try to get back

72
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,150
to that this is a dr improvement draft

73
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,740
we it passed working group last call but

74
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,370
last meeting we agreed that it should

75
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,190
have a little bit of text explaining why

76
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,860
this is different from the other dr

77
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:25,300
draft that we have been discussing in

78
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,000
the working group so yes I suggested

79
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,160
some text and if the offers are the

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,160
working group or happy with that we can

81
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,000
be long or we can discuss of course what

82
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,920
what we want to do but it's it's more or

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,690
less ready to be published or at least

84
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:46,750
go to the is G then we have an explicit

85
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,210
tracking draft that we will need to look

86
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,550
into again and see you what to do about

87
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,140
it whether we want to progress that

88
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,960
really want to maybe change the internet

89
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,760
status but at least for now that's not

90
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,960
being worked on

91
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,460
[Music]

92
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:09,878
we have a pin wizard bits draft it

93
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:14,739
passed workgroup last call and Billy

94
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:18,279
Mike is about to request application for

95
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,710
that there's two drafts discussed this

96
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:25,210
meet meeting non-registered packing and

97
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:29,289
BFD point-to-point mode use cases that's

98
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,688
all all I had for status one last slide

99
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,899
we haven't talked about this in a little

100
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:36,339
while apart maybe bring it up again now

101
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,229
so we talked a little bit a couple of

102
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,909
meetings ago about implementation

103
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,089
requirements and how different working

104
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:44,800
groups have different requirements and

105
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:49,930
we haven't really had any requirements

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,430
of all in this working group and yeah we

107
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,499
talked about this a little bit and at

108
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:58,029
least my feeling is that we are fairly

109
00:07:53,499 --> 00:08:00,580
happy about that what Mike and I photo

110
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,219
is that it might be good that at least

111
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,878
the chairs ask if there are any

112
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:09,909
implementations and if people not know

113
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,189
about implementations when they you know

114
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:15,219
when you finish off the draft and

115
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:17,709
request publication it might be nice to

116
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:19,330
have a section in there saying something

117
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:22,029
about implementations if you actually

118
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,948
are are aware already so no requirements

119
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:26,589
but this may be nice that we as a group

120
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,349
now if but know about what

121
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:32,380
implementation status is if we are aware

122
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:34,318
of it does that sound reasonable or any

123
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,159
comments on that

124
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:42,279
so no formal requirements just good if

125
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:46,600
we tell each other if you're aware of

126
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:55,120
anything so basically what we're aiming

127
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:56,910
for is at least that as as chairs as

128
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,760
chairs that we try to ask about

129
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,110
implementations but also maybe that

130
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,870
documents can mention implementations

131
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:10,050
but you won't go any further up towards

132
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,050
any requirements unless people want that

133
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:27,750
all right then I think we can start with

134
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:33,290
our first presentation yeah it's right

135
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:36,300
there it's about there yeah okay yeah

136
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,949
just a moment to bring it into

137
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:45,300
presentation about here yes thank you

138
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:48,030
okay okay so this is update to the draft

139
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,280
that we discussed and during our

140
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:55,530
discussion the recommendation was to

141
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:00,480
make it more generic so this is to

142
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:05,370
reflect what we have done and just to

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:12,060
recapture the proposed solution is to

144
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:17,190
use BFD for multi-point or referred to

145
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:22,650
as point to multi-point VFD to track to

146
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:28,410
enable in sm routers of over shared

147
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:33,270
segments to track status of the router

148
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,620
which takes unroll as a head end of a

149
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:41,520
point-to-multipoint BFD session

150
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:47,940
primarily we see that as the benefit to

151
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:52,860
track the status of dr and possibly be

152
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:59,090
there so the mechanics works that the

153
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:04,850
router that we want to track status adds

154
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:11,330
optional POV it advertises its locally

155
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:16,980
assigned 32 unsigned integer as its

156
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:20,870
discriminator there are specifics of

157
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:26,380
point to multi-point BFD comparing to

158
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:29,860
the classical BFD defined in RFC 58 8

159
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,890
is that there is no three-way handshake

160
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,730
so there be if these systems do not

161
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:40,600
exchange there are discriminated values

162
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:47,290
and thus the router that receives VFD

163
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:50,700
control packet cannot do multiplex give

164
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:54,760
these sessions based on its local

165
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:58,360
discriminator value which is in packet

166
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,680
placed in a euro discriminator field in

167
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:06,850
point-to-multipoint BMD if this session

168
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,910
or the state machine has changed and it

169
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,210
immediately progresses actually it

170
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,290
starts from the Upstate from the point

171
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:20,260
of view of the head end and head and

172
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:22,329
periodically transmits PFD control

173
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:26,590
packets with the euro discriminator

174
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:30,760
field of zero so multi-point tails

175
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:33,190
cannot different the multiplex different

176
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,520
DVD sessions are based on your

177
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,650
discriminator field so thus we need the

178
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,199
mechanism that boot straps are the

179
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,870
point-to-multipoint session by

180
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,670
transmitting the my discriminator from

181
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:51,090
the head and two tails and once the tail

182
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:54,520
receives my discriminator and if it's

183
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:58,990
configured to participate in tracking

184
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:03,010
the status of this PM sm node then it

185
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:07,120
must start with this session as a multi

186
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:11,830
ponytail and the multiplex using my

187
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,440
discriminator source IP address and the

188
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:22,560
multicast distribution tree that in it

189
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:27,310
receives on so what we specified is that

190
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:32,500
we're basically the specification only

191
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:37,930
covers the RFC and did ER improvement

192
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:40,209
draft that gr must include beef DTO v in

193
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:43,359
its team hello message

194
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:46,929
and the TV must be included after they

195
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,889
are addressed govt and BTR is

196
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:50,379
recommended

197
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:54,069
so basically recommended is identical to

198
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:57,759
shoot to include b FD t le in PM

199
00:13:54,069 --> 00:14:00,910
holo-message and if included if to be

200
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:08,399
included then it must follow after BTR

201
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:11,790
address tod so we welcome comments and

202
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:22,509
we think that we are ready for

203
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:23,019
consideration of the last call quick

204
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:25,209
comments

205
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,189
the doctor is called something news

206
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:40,628
cases but in reality you're specifying

207
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:44,920
something sure well yeah the tail the

208
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:46,839
document might be a little bit not not

209
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,790
not that good you know lack of

210
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:53,110
creativity at the moment I just read I

211
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,629
haven't read the whole thing I just read

212
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,809
the introduction mm-hmm or maybe the

213
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:02,949
abstract says that the enhancement is an

214
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:05,980
optional enhancement yeah to pin okay

215
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:12,069
good so the draft currently says it

216
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:16,689
updates so in turn 61 so don't put that

217
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:19,269
okay I think you're right I think it was

218
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:20,199
oversight and it should not yeah

219
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,329
actually

220
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,829
sorry just from the sentence you said

221
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,269
just because it's optional doesn't mean

222
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:27,008
it cannot be an update right so I didn't

223
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:37,420
quite get the semantics of what you're

224
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:39,009
trying to do okay so again it is not

225
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:45,610
completely clear to everyone what

226
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:47,679
updates means and in general what most

227
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:52,059
people use it for is for an actual

228
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:53,230
formal update to the updated RFC so what

229
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,000
it usually means is that

230
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,140
if I'm updating the pinyin specification

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,510
I'm actually saying this should be there

232
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,460
with the intent that if I'm implementing

233
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:08,890
that they spin the specification I have

234
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:10,330
to do this again this optional then that

235
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,310
probably shouldn't be there yeah it's

236
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:18,100
it's clearly optional and this is an

237
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:22,209
extension so whether go into the story

238
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,050
of ICS process it's not clear and so

239
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,010
there's been some discussion in the

240
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,829
eighties you have lists that I'm sure

241
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,830
all of you have enjoyed about what this

242
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:32,650
updates really means there is a new

243
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:35,860
proposal that we are putting together

244
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,020
that probably will be a draft release

245
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,200
next week there actually is going to get

246
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,880
rid of updates so that it's actually

247
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,060
clear and so there's going to be a new

248
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,070
tag that says I think the name is

249
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,290
something like immense or something like

250
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,980
that where it actually means this is a

251
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:57,280
change the base specification must use

252
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:01,390
this new thing you might be like a

253
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,240
parent and child related to distant

254
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,000
relative so there's 3d tags one that's

255
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,609
gonna say I think it's called the men's

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,099
so that the base specification must use

257
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:14,109
this extension not there's another one

258
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,060
there is extends or something like this

259
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,629
so that's how you do it something

260
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,010
optional

261
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,510
you're extending the protocol you're

262
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:25,119
adding something new or whatever and so

263
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,260
we it is useful to be able to tie those

264
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,639
two together right so that if you're

265
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,250
doing the base expect maybe you want to

266
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,900
see what other things are extensions so

267
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,080
you can do that and then there's a third

268
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,060
one which I think it's going to be

269
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,550
called something like see also or

270
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,770
something so that you're saying well

271
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,649
this is not an extension this is not a

272
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:48,490
mandatory thing but it would be nice if

273
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,230
you actually looked at that as well and

274
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,170
the reason motors would do that is

275
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,540
because those types of those three

276
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,820
different types of applications where

277
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,670
what people were using in some cases

278
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,960
when we talk about updates and so we

279
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,800
ended up with long threads so necessary

280
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,810
threads and stuff just discussing what

281
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,639
this really mean and your there are

282
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,560
examples of publisher RFC's that I

283
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,300
should use updates and those three

284
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,990
weights of these and probably in other

285
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:19,110
ways so you know for now I guess we're

286
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:22,790
saying updates as the formal you must do

287
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:26,219
this to do whatever the other this and

288
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,750
soon I don't know hopefully we can get

289
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,480
that through community and everything

290
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:36,780
else soon we'll have those other tags

291
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,160
yeah I've told the sacred and so the the

292
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,240
only reason right now why you really

293
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,420
would say you must do something is if it

294
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,700
incurs a backward incompatibility right

295
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,460
yeah sure in general yes if you're

296
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,800
actually changing something that you

297
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,330
wouldn't be compatible or if you making

298
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,649
a change to the base specification that

299
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,080
you think is really really important for

300
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,030
everyone to use then you would do that

301
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,149
for the other normal cases of your

302
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,530
change in the registries for example you

303
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,760
define some registries you not actually

304
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,649
changing the protocol but you just find

305
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,870
some registers registries through a in

306
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,390
it and now you're changing those

307
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,520
registries not assigning a new clones

308
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,570
but now you're saying instead of using

309
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,100
specification required I now want to use

310
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,629
ATF review or whatever then there's a

311
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:27,990
change it's not change to the protocol

312
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:29,970
but it change to the I have a couple of

313
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,970
comments some the draft just one

314
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,400
clarification first this is already a

315
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,500
working group document yes so that name

316
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,690
to draft them you have there is the old

317
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,750
one it's yeah I know preparing slides

318
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,370
oops

319
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,770
honoring it is a working group draft yes

320
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:53,669
I have a more important technical

321
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,910
comment oh so you are saying on this

322
00:19:53,670 --> 00:20:00,450
slide here right that the deed that be F

323
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:03,150
DT L we must come after the other yes

324
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,280
and I would say in general today we

325
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,100
don't have any requirements on ordering

326
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,470
for hello options and I think many

327
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,750
implementations just kind of parse all

328
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:17,370
of them first mm-hmm and then afterwards

329
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,960
Jan so ok be better to just say that

330
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,539
both

331
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,750
be present or something yeah okay so

332
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:26,390
okay I will reward so that both must be

333
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,210
present but then I have one more comment

334
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:33,380
though there are implementations today

335
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,950
using EFT regular point-to-point BFD

336
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,919
with him mmm-hmm for you know quickly

337
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,840
find out that the dr has gone away so i

338
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,740
feel like you know what is in this draft

339
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,490
is useful also in the pennant of the dr

340
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,919
increment draft so I think at least my

341
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,429
opinion is that it will be good to allow

342
00:20:51,919 --> 00:21:01,090
people to use this hello option also

343
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:03,320
with regardless so dr improvement to use

344
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,439
basically you know advertise my

345
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:13,250
discriminator yeah but yeah the thing is

346
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:16,610
that the this DF DT of V discriminator

347
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,340
is needed only if we use a

348
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:25,580
point-to-multipoint BF d if someone is

349
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:28,689
using RFC 58 80 then or 51 probably

350
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:32,689
because it's a single hop use case then

351
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:36,490
there is no need to bootstrap so sorry

352
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:39,200
what I mean is it can be useful to use

353
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,419
announce your discriminator even if

354
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:48,230
you're not implementing the pin bre

355
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:50,450
improvement draft oh yes and that's i

356
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,490
think that we'll probably have this

357
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:56,419
discussion later during the meeting

358
00:21:52,490 --> 00:22:00,980
because I read their other draft and I

359
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:04,039
have couple questions about it so how to

360
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,679
work and because their procedure is a

361
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:11,510
little bit different from the procedure

362
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:17,570
and then the question is since there is

363
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:22,129
no explicit advertisement of dr address

364
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:25,610
and v dr address so if how it will be

365
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,529
interpreted BF d TLV i need to might be

366
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:31,549
discuss it with offers of that other

367
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,000
draft so at least you do many of you

368
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,120
always

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,180
to the re-election with existing in

370
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,840
sparse mode so one router one neighbor

371
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:47,000
is regarded as being the dr yeah but

372
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:52,399
what will happen so if there are more

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:56,450
than one router requested to be to

374
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,320
become multi point head so and start and

375
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:07,150
sends its beef DTO V so we expect that

376
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:07,149
others will monitor it so basically then

377
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:13,330
okay

378
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:27,500
let me think about location yep okay

379
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:29,000
okay any other comments so do people

380
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,990
have any thoughts about working group

381
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,700
last call this my feeling is that yeah

382
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,540
there might be worth thinking a little

383
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,620
bit about okay sure these details but do

384
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,180
people think it's ready otherwise so any

385
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:51,919
any thoughts on whether should go to

386
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:53,930
last call shortly so once if we work out

387
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,470
these details before the next IDF

388
00:23:53,930 --> 00:24:00,260
meeting we should attentively consider a

389
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:04,190
last call before an excite us people

390
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:08,060
think how our update what we agreed to

391
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:13,100
change remove requirement of ordering

392
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:14,870
but Jessie might be present and then I

393
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,889
will think about how it interacts with

394
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:20,719
this another draft yeah okay so yeah

395
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,550
we'll have some discussion on the

396
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,220
mailing list and also check on the list

397
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:28,659
later if it can go to last caller okay

398
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,660
thank you okay thanks

399
00:24:36,559 --> 00:25:03,149
like stop this Hong ji let's see if I

400
00:24:48,929 --> 00:25:05,880
can find it here it's this colossal no

401
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:10,950
everyone my name is Hong ji I am from

402
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:13,770
erikson now let me introduce um let me

403
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:18,990
introduce some updates about the IGMP

404
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:22,559
Amardeep rousey yamato this is a server

405
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:26,160
version for the presentation after after

406
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,610
last the ITF meeting we have about two

407
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:33,330
more quarters money is from cisco and

408
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:36,510
maja shades from to infer now we have

409
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:40,280
totally file all sirs

410
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:44,910
camera covers the five different winners

411
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:53,480
ericsson bottom and walk away Cisco and

412
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:56,970
juniper just update one we obtains a

413
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:00,299
constraint to make sure the upstream

414
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:04,140
interface for our MV MLD policy should

415
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:06,570
not be configured pimp in the old

416
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,260
version we have already higher this

417
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:14,240
constraint but it has some limitation in

418
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:19,950
this in the current version we have

419
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:28,260
solved this limitation with the not

420
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:31,410
function in the as pass and they true we

421
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,410
have added the fever Fisher I gem he

422
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:38,100
foxy to make the implementation more

423
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:42,230
flexible this is the whole hierarchy for

424
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,750
the agency policy we augment the

425
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:48,230
conference hall call as

426
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:53,169
continue a GMP policy under the identify

427
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,169
see it has a list of interfaces

428
00:26:53,559 --> 00:27:01,639
similarly we also add the official MLD

429
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:10,129
proxy this is a whole hierarchy for the

430
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:14,600
MLD proxy this is the common scenario

431
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:17,390
for the agency policy we generally we

432
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,110
all configure the agency policy on the

433
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:24,590
upstream interface once - but the other

434
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:30,770
two interfaces are connected to the

435
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:34,879
receivers this is the configuration data

436
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:39,770
for the IGMP proxy we set the type of

437
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:44,020
the contrary palcohol IGMP foxy and the

438
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:50,570
interface name is 1/1 and the name field

439
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:53,690
enable field is that true there is still

440
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:59,379
some s all comments

441
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:03,440
Mahima is the author of the RC is 1 & 4

442
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:07,370
hey thinks that the IGMP prossimo do for

443
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:12,370
the pic take a call me into a gmpm early

444
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:18,280
interworking function in RFC is 1 1 for

445
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:22,459
FC 8 1 for provide a solution for the

446
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:27,100
ipv4 multicast service to the ipv4

447
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:32,480
multicast clients through the ipv6

448
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:37,428
multicast networks this new function it

449
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,330
combines the EMP policy function and the

450
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,590
address

451
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:44,389
synthesizing operations this is the

452
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:51,340
Padre in the RFC

453
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:54,950
8 1 & 4 but I think it is not proper to

454
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:58,080
consider it when designing the HMP

455
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,690
falsey llamado because

456
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,960
I think I generally in the working

457
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:08,820
function it's just the the application

458
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:20,580
of the edge MPI morality policy hmm what

459
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:25,168
do you think that my staff I would like

460
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:30,749
to apply for the local ocean and welcome

461
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:36,779
more comments Thanks yeah so I guess I

462
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:39,330
have a comment on the 80 114 support I

463
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:41,669
don't have a strong feeling either way

464
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,299
but I'm not sure how many

465
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:47,749
implementations there are all that and I

466
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:50,869
guess the yang mellows most attractive

467
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:52,979
or should they address the things that

468
00:29:50,869 --> 00:30:00,978
that most implementations have

469
00:29:52,979 --> 00:30:03,570
implemented right but but yeah I guess

470
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:05,580
there's yeah we're just talking about

471
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:10,049
that adoption now so we have time to

472
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:13,849
discuss that further okay okay

473
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:16,229
so I think okay well I mean yeah if

474
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:18,359
somebody like Mohammed has opinions

475
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:20,700
about the adoption if it's inclusive of

476
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,080
theta or not I would say you know if

477
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,639
there is a proposal how it should be

478
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,109
done that makes it clear that if you

479
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:27,389
don't implement that function there is

480
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:30,029
no problem to express that in the model

481
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:32,309
and it would otherwise work I think it

482
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:34,499
could well be in scope right so just

483
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,789
when we're doing the adoption right it

484
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,320
would be good to have an opinion off

485
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:39,570
whether that could be in scope or if

486
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,799
people really don't want it here let's

487
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:45,149
go yeah it'll be good to know more

488
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:50,759
understand better about this involved

489
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:52,709
yeah so I think we we Morris agree yeah

490
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,549
I think they agreed last meeting last

491
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:58,679
ITF meeting to do an adoption call I'm

492
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,629
not sure about that but I think we did

493
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:05,519
that but they never actually did the

494
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:08,129
adoption call sorry about that are

495
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,270
people finally the stealing another

496
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:17,668
adoption call on the list

497
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:20,280
this time so I know not that many people

498
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:23,640
read the yang model drafts unfortunately

499
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,450
but can I see how many people have read

500
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:30,480
this draft yeah it's just a couple of

501
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,750
people at least one of them is one of

502
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,750
the authors

503
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:41,400
but yeah unless people have any strong

504
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:44,280
feelings either way against or in in the

505
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,020
favored adoption I think well I'll just

506
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,440
do an adoption call on the list and see

507
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:53,309
what people think we have at least

508
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,140
support from five different vendors it

509
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:57,139
seems so that's pretty good

510
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:04,580
all right so do an adoption call

511
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,580
analysts okay thank you

512
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:30,740
okay next is RAM key on bail registered

513
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:32,180
patent good afternoon everyone

514
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:41,060
thanks food opps need to present the

515
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:46,100
draft so the draft had been presented in

516
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:48,260
multiple ideas before so so in a

517
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,449
nutshell the draft speaks about how to

518
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,870
pack null registers in a single message

519
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:56,270
whenever possible so there are a couple

520
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,209
of additions were done before in the

521
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:02,930
prog ietf but after that there's demo

522
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:10,460
additions so we are looking like I said

523
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:20,570
ready for last group call yeah any

524
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:21,610
comments yeah so how many people read

525
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,230
this draft

526
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:30,800
it hasn't changed in and I'm on ITF so

527
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:36,940
can I see if you read this draft before

528
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:39,950
the previous ITF for since that mmm

529
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:48,470
one person two people read it three

530
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:51,200
people okay any any force on whether we

531
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,000
should do a working group last call do

532
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,730
you see any issues or things that are

533
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,720
missing from the draft I think we'll do

534
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,910
our working group last call them I think

535
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,690
often we need to do a last call just to

536
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:12,950
get people to read the draft which is

537
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:15,080
unfortunate but I think we'll do that if

538
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,799
yeah if you find any issues during the

539
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,969
last call

540
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,530
of course we'll work on those and we

541
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,899
also need people to voice their support

542
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,790
oh and working group last call it's not

543
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:32,940
enough to not hear any comment

544
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:35,159
from people law rights both do a working

545
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,980
last call and hopefully some of your

546
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:44,759
people will help us out read the draft

547
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:46,040
and provide comments all right okay

548
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,570
thanks

549
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:55,650
so yeah we'll do our last call on the

550
00:34:48,570 --> 00:35:00,800
lists then we got yeah I've got one more

551
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,800
draft let's see if I can find the slides

552
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:16,140
yeah

553
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,480
so this traffic box talks about how to

554
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,810
distribute the user configured SSN

555
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,990
ranges in an l2 Network so this is

556
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:28,320
necessary because not have consistent as

557
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:30,990
is some operation so the starchy v2 or

558
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,060
v3 joins for the elements need to be

559
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,910
discarded by the routers and the

560
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,040
switches so if it doesn't discard those

561
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:41,370
groups starts cooperating in veto

562
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,790
compatible mode so what happens is if

563
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:47,430
you get a leave for those groups and the

564
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,950
router may send a v2 query to the horse

565
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,779
so the SSM hosts so the SLM host will

566
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,180
think that the router is operating in a

567
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,790
v2 mode and it will downgrade itself to

568
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,089
the way to operation so the SSM hosts

569
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:03,240
will fail in will fail so they no longer

570
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:06,570
send the viiiage joins so the draft

571
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,899
proposes to distribute the SSM ranges in

572
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:12,120
a film hello option so that the l2

573
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,870
switches can learn about this user

574
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:20,940
configured SSM ranges and draft the

575
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:23,700
reports for the v2 groups so so this

576
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,760
this will ensure like this is consistent

577
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,370
in the network and and also it was

578
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:33,990
dynamics we know enough like going and

579
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:39,650
configure a CLI on every l2 box yeah so

580
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:39,649
that's this raft so in comments on it

581
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,330
so is this implying that the SSM range

582
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:04,580
is named out of Lenny Giuliano Jennifer

583
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,200
um is this assuming that the SSM range

584
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,080
that has been configured for something

585
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,379
other than 230 2/8 yeah so okay the

586
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:26,890
draft allows it to be used or configured

587
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:29,960
for we - how how widely deployed is

588
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:34,370
people do it configuring a different

589
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,470
range other than 232 /e I've seen few

590
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:39,560
customers doing it but I don't know

591
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:41,720
exactly like what is the how many

592
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:46,250
customers do for the customers who do do

593
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:51,319
it would this be applicable meaning are

594
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:53,320
they doing it for strange odd reasons

595
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:59,120
that might not have they might not have

596
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:00,710
actual end users running IGMP that would

597
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,460
be dousing each other because they have

598
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:10,760
different SSM ranges or is that too

599
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:13,550
difficult to speculate I don't know I

600
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,560
bought that like so there are most of

601
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,110
the users use the 232 range but there

602
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,630
are there is a possibility of customers

603
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,430
using to that user configured range or

604
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,590
the network when you can specify in the

605
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,580
host stack as well so they want to use

606
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,770
this as a sim range

607
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,509
so I've seen few customers using it and

608
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,240
I've seen one of the customer running

609
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:39,650
into this problem where the esses impose

610
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:42,379
were stopped working after it needs spin

611
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,660
for Deutsche Telekom Lenny to your

612
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:48,940
question there's actually a good reason

613
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:51,210
for using a different range than in SSM

614
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,460
32 range

615
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,480
which is due to a strange behavior in

616
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:01,410
the linux kernel so if you have a device

617
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:08,340
on your home network which sends out an

618
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:11,220
IP version 2 message and govern IGMP

619
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:14,370
version 3 s sm device also on there it

620
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:19,680
for its specs sometimes to IGMP version

621
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:24,240
3 with a SM so with stock emoji at least

622
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:27,839
we have the situation yes and that's in

623
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,750
232 and as long as it is in 232 your

624
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,570
home gateway will discount a packet and

625
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:36,390
if you move there the range outside of

626
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:39,060
232 you don't have that issue anymore

627
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:45,150
because the home gateway says this is

628
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:49,320
not a necessary so that's fine tell us

629
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:51,750
Eckert I think that there is a good

630
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,520
reason why we have administrative scope

631
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:58,530
multicast and company video announcement

632
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,540
where the boss tells all the secrets

633
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:03,330
only to the employees right so I don't

634
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,580
want to have SM not be able to do that I

635
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:07,680
know I know we should all stop using

636
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,240
ipv4 completely and go to v6 where the

637
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,490
problem solved because we have all the

638
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,080
administrative scopes but for the few

639
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:16,080
billions of us left that you know

640
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,150
operate on before addresses at least

641
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,580
this has been given out you know to 39.2

642
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:24,690
32 as a recommendation to configure

643
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:27,840
forever i I've seen a lot of networks

644
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,610
that just have also their to only that

645
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,760
don't even have layer 3 large switch

646
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:34,230
networks right three tiers broadband

647
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,630
aggregation networks you may not even

648
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,670
have a pin router so I strongly suggest

649
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,590
to figure out if you cannot also do that

650
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,240
as an IP extension yeah so let the

651
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:44,040
driver mentions that part as well to

652
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,540
have a high jumping message right to

653
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,850
distribute this ranges from the courier

654
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,400
yeah yet if that would have been clear

655
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,810
in the title or so I I hope I didn't

656
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,910
overlook it in what you said but if

657
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,980
there was an option to have it in a pure

658
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,319
layer 2 yeah yeah whatever

659
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,880
hello option or whatever it goes in an

660
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,620
IP packet I haven't thought what's the

661
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,270
best place but if we have a solution

662
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,900
that works without him then acting it's

663
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,900
but yeah

664
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,250
some I'm a quaver all the drafts

665
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,240
speaking as an offer

666
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:18,030
I believe our people doing SSM inside

667
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,368
239 because they want to do sculpt as a

668
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,829
semi that it it's not leaking outside

669
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:27,480
their domain which is yeah pretty much

670
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:30,030
what Tyler said I wonder a bit if it

671
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,619
would be useful in maybe I'm buddy I

672
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,990
know to have some draft or like

673
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,349
operational issues to the SSM deploying

674
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:39,479
SSM and pleased is this I know but at

675
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:42,329
least is this this fallback is one of

676
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,970
those issues and one problem are seen is

677
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:48,030
in the our GPS back it says you should

678
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:50,308
fall back to star G but then you have

679
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,470
the s of this SSM draft that says you

680
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:55,829
should must not or should not fall back

681
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:57,598
but if we are implemented idmp draft and

682
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:01,640
not sort of the SSM draft you might

683
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,349
claim your compliance this this is

684
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,170
simple enough is it I mean sure present

685
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:10,770
in and only but I just have this is it

686
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:12,839
as a document in him go forward Fisher

687
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,250
don't regardless regardless of this

688
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:17,520
document that one if it would be helpful

689
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:19,319
to discuss operational issues and then

690
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,599
bounty or we can discuss the not all I'm

691
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,730
saying is that it's this is two or three

692
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,430
paragraphs to explain the examples this

693
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,200
can all be in one document yeah take off

694
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,960
load from the ITF just have a single

695
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,609
document that also has a paragraph on

696
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,190
the operational reason why we need this

697
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:37,140
right so I think we've often enough run

698
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,940
into you know legacy receivers that are

699
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,859
just sending the group address and then

700
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,660
basically all the SSM receivers are

701
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,910
screwed right now all the receivers

702
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,558
group because you needed to have the

703
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,808
source address to be handed up whether

704
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,900
it's being handed up by a proxying the

705
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:53,790
router or a GMP proxy or or by a pimp

706
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,799
router so I think it's not too difficult

707
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:58,849
to describe the operational things also

708
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,849
the protocols running

709
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:19,630
how many people read this draft three

710
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:22,230
people yeah so I think it's it's it's

711
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:26,770
bit too early to do an adoption call

712
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:29,770
today usually we need a couple ITF small

713
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,920
s what is one ITF for people to have

714
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:35,620
read read address for this work okay

715
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:41,650
yeah sorry I have one person supporting

716
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:45,700
it yeah I would say please read the

717
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:49,990
draft please comment on on the list if

718
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:54,480
you have any questions and it's one of

719
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:57,220
the offers yeah we offer to also try to

720
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,390
start a thread on a mailing list and get

721
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,980
some input and hopefully by next ITF

722
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:11,319
several people will be familiar with

723
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:15,060
this and we can see how to proceed okay

724
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,060
all right okay thanks thanks

725
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:33,509
my cue and next if you can hear me yeah

726
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:50,550
I can hear you can you start yeah let me

727
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:51,240
just get the slides alright you're good

728
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:56,430
to go

729
00:44:51,240 --> 00:45:00,839
okay so this draft is something that how

730
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:03,060
you and I put together to specify

731
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,780
requirements of on path telemetry for

732
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,270
multicast traffic there are a few

733
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:13,470
telemetry solutions out there such as I

734
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:19,200
am and PBT that are being worked on in

735
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:21,629
the AI ppm working group and we see that

736
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,819
there's a seems to be a lacking of

737
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,910
support for multicast to traffic in that

738
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,850
kind of an environment so we put this

739
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:35,430
together we are presenting it here just

740
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:37,310
kind of to socialize it and next ITF we

741
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:41,040
will likely ask for time which is

742
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:44,070
limited in the AI ppm working group but

743
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,050
being that this group is multicast of

744
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,820
experts and maybe you have already

745
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:50,670
thought about this that maybe you have

746
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,010
some solutions I know Greg mirskiy and

747
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,660
others are involved in AI ppm work so

748
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,590
maybe maybe this is something that's

749
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:00,240
been discussed and also part of the

750
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:03,830
background is we represent a few

751
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:07,160
potential solutions to have multicast

752
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:11,670
supported in these telemetry solutions

753
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,839
and maybe what we need to do and this is

754
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,920
another reason that I wanted to present

755
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,630
here is that if those that are

756
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,610
interested maybe we do need to spawn off

757
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:22,020
a requirements draft before discussing

758
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:25,830
some of these solution so we do we do

759
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:28,460
have of course existing OAM techniques

760
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:31,799
that are out there M tres et cetera

761
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,690
those of you that are familiar with some

762
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,900
of the on path to elementary techniques

763
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,079
they are promising there

764
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,789
progressing and there are some

765
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:45,609
implementations out there

766
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:49,450
Gregg ice-t lined up go ahead okay it's

767
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:53,589
great that you decided to look at this

768
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:57,189
and be very much interested to work

769
00:46:53,589 --> 00:47:00,808
together I can point to the document

770
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:03,670
that is in a beer working group on

771
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:08,740
applicability of alternate marking

772
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:11,349
method its RFC 8321 to beer because

773
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:15,569
alternate marking method can be not on

774
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:18,579
can use be not only important to point

775
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:21,819
packet to us and delay measurement but

776
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:24,400
in point-to-multipoint the author's

777
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:28,299
working on multiple draft basically

778
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:33,819
which is the to impede scenario in Peter

779
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:36,339
Peter to MP 2 MP but RFC 8321

780
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:38,920
is applicable and we have a document in

781
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:42,250
here which explains how it's used and

782
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,829
what what it gives so we can definitely

783
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:49,210
look at more generic scenario how it can

784
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:51,819
be done in general multicast okay thank

785
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:54,279
you and we do reference your document

786
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:57,869
your OEM document that's in beer we

787
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:57,869
reference that in this in this draft

788
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,230
okay yes so the current on path

789
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:09,099
telemetry techniques do have some flaws

790
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:12,099
at least for multicast with I am every

791
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:14,460
packet carries the entire trace data so

792
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:19,779
there's a lot of data redundancy and

793
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:22,000
with PBT post card based trees there's

794
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:25,779
no branch identifiers so it's you can't

795
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,569
correlate the postcards and so we're

796
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:34,809
trying to produce a solution that

797
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:35,740
addresses these these issues great thank

798
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:39,730
you

799
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:42,038
okay I I missed this draft I would have

800
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:45,160
read and probably my comments would be

801
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:48,730
high quality I can point to another

802
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:51,730
draft individual draft that exists in IP

803
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:54,880
working group it's uncalled hybrid

804
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:59,200
2-step method what hybrid two-step does

805
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:03,000
is it uses the trigger to do measurement

806
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:07,299
and then measurement packets are

807
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,760
transported as a follow-up packet

808
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,070
collecting measurements because they

809
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,860
share the same encapsulation as the

810
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:16,450
packet that triggered the measurement so

811
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,610
that might be interesting

812
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,649
I haven't actually I I admit I haven't

813
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:25,390
thought about using this method and what

814
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:26,980
it will result for the multicast but it

815
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,430
will be very interesting to discuss that

816
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,000
too

817
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:32,770
thank you okay hybrid two-step okay I'll

818
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,390
reach out to you after this and let's

819
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:43,509
maybe we can collaborate further next

820
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:45,580
slide stick yeah alright yeah so and

821
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,880
there's only one more slide after this

822
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:51,130
so there are two solutions there's a per

823
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,460
hop postcard which is an enhancement to

824
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,680
the original pbd scheme and then there's

825
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,350
a per section postcard which is an

826
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,930
enhancement to the IO am scheme which is

827
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:10,569
pretty popular for the per hop postcard

828
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:13,509
idea each branch adds a branch

829
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:18,370
identifier to the instruction header and

830
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:20,380
so you have a postcard with a branch

831
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:22,120
identifier there in brackets and then

832
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,910
the telemetry data is in the squiggly

833
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:32,799
brackets and that data is being sent up

834
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:37,330
at each branch node next slide yeah okay

835
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:43,150
example perfect and then so there's a

836
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:46,529
per section postcard example as well and

837
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,670
and another proposed solution is that a

838
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,430
section is the path between two adjacent

839
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:54,430
branch nodes or between a branch node

840
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:57,190
and it's leaf node and then a postcard

841
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:58,600
is sent at each sections and node and

842
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,820
that postcard contains data for the

843
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,640
entire section

844
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,130
and they these postcards for a packet

845
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,950
can be stitched together and there's no

846
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,300
need to I get modify any IOM header

847
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,759
format we just need to refresh the

848
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:16,780
header at each section head and send

849
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:21,100
that information up to a telemetry

850
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:23,500
collector so these are again details

851
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,750
that can be hashed out more in the I ppm

852
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:31,720
working group if you go to the next

853
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:33,640
slide the last slide yes so this is

854
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,160
really the only thing that we're asking

855
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,170
is just to review this you're welcome to

856
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,149
contribute I already know one grade that

857
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:43,960
we're gonna reach out to discuss this

858
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:45,430
further and we're not going to be asking

859
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,930
anything of PIM and this will not be a

860
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:55,529
document that's worked on in PIM

861
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:55,529
any further comments or questions

862
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:08,119
if not thank you yeah so um yeah yeah I

863
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:09,680
read this myself by the way and so the

864
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,799
main reason for the postcards is

865
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,589
basically so you don't need to send any

866
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:21,259
additional data in the data packet

867
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:23,690
downstream right right yeah okay all

868
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:28,819
right okay yeah I'm gonna read it myself

869
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:32,839
again thank you thank you all right all

870
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:46,069
right well ahead of schedule here so

871
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:48,529
next presentation on my Farrar MBL

872
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:50,119
remind people already now that there's

873
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:54,349
also an Bondi meeting in this room

874
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:56,269
afterwards so you should know please

875
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:58,069
please come up but yeah just a reminder

876
00:52:56,269 --> 00:52:59,959
that I'm bound these sessions in this

877
00:52:58,069 --> 00:53:13,660
room later so I hope you all will stay

878
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:17,749
for that yeah see okay thank you hermit

879
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:27,920
children from Hawaii and present present

880
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:33,828
eighteen MOF are based on tra fade here

881
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:41,079
is some backgrounds ofa introduced by

882
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:41,079
unicast it's based on the algorithm that

883
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:49,999
packet campus in the two it's directly

884
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:56,078
collected the labor and the packet won't

885
00:53:49,999 --> 00:54:00,799
go back to the router itself so in this

886
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:08,420
Ringo Oh topology are force in their

887
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:11,779
packet to r3 and the target are true it

888
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:14,310
can issue a that are three won't go back

889
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:21,840
to our four

890
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:25,590
so Marika's can also use this feature it

891
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:33,030
is described in the FC 74

892
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:39,060
31 and then Yoli cast had advanced the

893
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:46,110
LFA to remote Arif way the the left

894
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:53,509
picture described the RF a lot the the

895
00:54:46,110 --> 00:55:00,870
cost in each link it will cause that

896
00:54:53,510 --> 00:55:04,800
that direct labor of our r5 cannot

897
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:10,109
ensure the Kannada issue as a loop free

898
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:14,040
for example our file send a packet to r4

899
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:17,310
and the target are two then the packet

900
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:22,440
will go back to our file so in this

901
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:29,250
example the RFA algorithm will have to

902
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:33,060
calculate remote point R 3 so our 5 send

903
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:40,650
it to R 3 and the target are true then

904
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:45,690
it will not want to go loop and then in

905
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:54,390
the second routine to introduce the gif

906
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:59,570
a this is example topology are from our

907
00:55:54,390 --> 00:56:05,810
6 2 r 2 there is obviously obviously

908
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:15,870
link directly click the link how can we

909
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:19,290
find a backup backup path clear here we

910
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:22,170
can send the packet to R 4 and then

911
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:27,029
through R 3 and of course this packet

912
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:28,020
from our for to R 3 and then R 3 who

913
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:35,400
won't

914
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:39,720
then no back own own own happen so

915
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:44,040
that's the that's the advance of our

916
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:54,480
fake and we can now see what's the

917
00:56:44,040 --> 00:57:00,980
problem with MOF are here as just

918
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:06,060
introduced ours are six can have a

919
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:11,609
backup pass through r4 and earth are

920
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:17,849
three and this can be this can be done

921
00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:20,940
in unicast by explicit repair knees are

922
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:25,950
four and the in the face

923
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:33,740
one two in F is 2 and then then target

924
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:33,740
are true but the problem is that

925
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:43,530
sorry I missed some background in the in

926
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:48,630
the MOF are there is a pin vector

927
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:54,420
attribute concur in the explicit point

928
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:59,839
that a pin joint can can go through so

929
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:07,369
in this example are six can add that

930
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:11,670
attribute of r4 and r3 and tend to

931
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:16,230
establish the backup path but here the

932
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:23,180
the problem is that when even between r4

933
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:28,589
and r3 there are four if you just

934
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:32,779
included the load the load the load ID

935
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:41,060
r4 country centre the pin joint to r3

936
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:44,810
because our for though r3 that

937
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:56,980
directly corrected labor but for our for

938
00:58:44,810 --> 00:59:01,700
it is not the it's not the RPF pass so

939
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:09,380
the solution way proposes is that we add

940
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:12,680
a team actor actor appointed out there

941
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:17,210
interface from individual to in the fist

942
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:25,879
to and then they are for get this vector

943
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:30,020
and can no no that it don't need to send

944
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:34,040
the team joy across the short short is

945
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:38,270
the pass but through the vector carrying

946
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:44,589
in the packet so this is a proposal

947
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:50,089
proposed extension to PIM RPF vector

948
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:54,770
currently attribute AB 0 and the

949
00:59:50,089 --> 01:00:00,490
attribute type for is defined as pin

950
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:05,660
vector you say in our presentation we

951
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:12,759
propose a lil pimp vector attribute to

952
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:17,660
the AF F it will be 0 repeat or your

953
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:23,680
indicates the last joint attribute the

954
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:27,950
value it's the unicast address of that

955
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:32,390
direct directly collected labor and the

956
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:39,529
type the type tells that tells the rotor

957
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:49,098
not to use the normal RPF RPF interface

958
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:52,990
but use their in the face indicated by

959
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:52,990
this by this vector

960
01:00:54,210 --> 01:01:02,010
this function can also be used in a

961
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:06,510
multipy but today I wear a lot cava ml

962
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:14,070
DP so that's the let's say an

963
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:17,139
introduction of this idea any comments I

964
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,139
[Music]

965
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:25,560
have one comment so for this extension

966
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:27,980
you specify your own interface address

967
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:32,430
and the neighbors address to uniquely

968
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:38,280
think uniquely identify this segment

969
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:42,140
right there is an existing RFC for route

970
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:44,579
an interface identifier pin hello option

971
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:48,390
that can be used to also uniquely

972
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:52,560
identify an interface on a router so

973
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:55,710
wonder if maybe that could be helpful so

974
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,099
hard to explain here but basically the

975
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:59,700
way that

976
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:02,010
hello option works is that a router can

977
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:05,040
announce say a new pack address or

978
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:09,380
something plus also a unique ID for each

979
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:12,750
of its interfaces so for a given router

980
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:14,880
on each of your interfaces very soon up

981
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:18,540
in hello we will announce the different

982
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:21,119
identifiers but yeah I don't know if it

983
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:22,589
helps or not but at least that suggests

984
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,710
just thinking about it

985
01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:30,170
I can send you an email with the RFC

986
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:30,170
number issue a thank you thank you okay

987
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:34,220
any other comments

988
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:50,200
see everyone comment

989
01:02:52,990 --> 01:03:00,919
Bishop Eric Cisco so there's already RFC

990
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:08,840
for an explicit RPF vector in pin did

991
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:11,810
you consider extending that sorry there

992
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:16,040
is an existing RFC that defines the

993
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:21,610
explicit RPF vector in pin jong-kook

994
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:25,810
messages did you consider extending that

995
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:28,960
before before doing this forward

996
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:41,180
sorry kiyo taker this through the list

997
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:44,930
okay thank you okay so encourage people

998
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:50,470
to please read the draft and comment on

999
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:53,240
on other mailing lists okay great

1000
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:59,230
okay then we have one one last

1001
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:59,229
presentation on IBM PM Modi evolution

1002
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:40,470
no it's this one of course hi good

1003
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:43,250
afternoon my name is olafemi caramel Ave

1004
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:46,049
Ave me koala Faye and I work for a star

1005
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:49,200
networks and they're a bunch of us

1006
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:50,730
working together on this work and nobody

1007
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:57,779
volunteered to give the talks even got

1008
01:04:50,730 --> 01:05:02,040
me recently yeah so busy to set some

1009
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,510
background so the idea is Stig and sent

1010
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,580
an email to the list I guess a few

1011
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:09,150
months ago saying that the working group

1012
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:11,759
wants to move IGMP v3 and MLD v2 to fill

1013
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:13,590
standards and looking for some

1014
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,410
volunteers they can all help with this

1015
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:18,030
work so the idea is before we can do

1016
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,859
that we need to follow the IETF process

1017
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:22,380
and two big things we have to try to do

1018
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:25,350
one is to determine what features and

1019
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:27,660
heiresses are not widely used okay and

1020
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:30,210
then also to figure if there are any

1021
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:32,339
kind of interrupt issues that arisen

1022
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,290
from these two protocols and there is

1023
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:36,570
and these the the answer to these

1024
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:38,940
questions will kind of inform how the

1025
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:41,640
working group what the working group

1026
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,920
does going forward so how should we

1027
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,150
answer these questions well there was a

1028
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,650
similar process character for sparse

1029
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:51,480
mode half a while back so the suggestion

1030
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:53,460
from the chairs was to use that approach

1031
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,070
which is basically to do a survey of the

1032
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,980
community so sorry vendors and operators

1033
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:01,710
and ask them questions to help us try to

1034
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:04,230
answer this to bake questions so there's

1035
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,400
a team assembled and the authors are

1036
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,900
Cannella so at this time we've been

1037
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,970
kinda having regular meetings I guess

1038
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,830
already a few months and we've created a

1039
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:13,740
draft of the survey which is listed

1040
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:17,490
there and so that's like in the

1041
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:19,850
background so the survey like I was seen

1042
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:24,000
is gonna be targeted our operators and

1043
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:25,799
vendors and also because IGMP because of

1044
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,750
iterative protocol yourself to maybe try

1045
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:31,230
to get some post implementers to

1046
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:32,640
can help answer the questions like I

1047
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,290
said the questions are in the draft

1048
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,700
would be really good to have a look at

1049
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,470
that to have some kind of feedback from

1050
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,689
you guys and then the results will be

1051
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:41,910
kept confidential so we'll just do exact

1052
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:44,300
same process like was done for pen

1053
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:47,069
sparse mode okay

1054
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,750
so next steps please review the

1055
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:51,600
questions I've said that thought type

1056
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:53,040
and also carbs is one kind of open issue

1057
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:57,810
that we've not quite resolved and it's

1058
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:59,700
what to do about features okay so should

1059
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:02,580
we all should we the less features at

1060
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:05,370
all or should we list features only in

1061
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:07,980
the RFC's okay because the idea is there

1062
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:10,560
are if you ask people tell me some IGMP

1063
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,450
v3 features that you use they may

1064
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,420
actually see some features I know in RFC

1065
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:16,890
so I should we can resolve that so

1066
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,560
that's maybe one thing that we're kind

1067
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:21,509
of looking for some input about so we

1068
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,820
can discuss that here on the list and

1069
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,110
once things are finished and the kind of

1070
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,210
working group chairs that can happy with

1071
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:31,260
it they'll be useful to try together as

1072
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:38,340
distributed as widely as possible so

1073
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:41,460
that's so our GMP an emerald RGB v3 and

1074
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:43,410
M LDV to have lots of stuff in them and

1075
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:45,830
a lot of stuff that nobody ever did it

1076
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:51,509
never never implemented or use

1077
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:53,040
lightweight IGMP v3 in MLD v2 was a spec

1078
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:57,210
that was written kind of as a response

1079
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:01,230
to that what if what if we discover that

1080
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:05,450
lightweight IGMP and MLD

1081
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:10,380
is more accurate is a more accurate

1082
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:18,839
state of deployment could that become

1083
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:19,500
the new internet standard or possibly

1084
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:20,908
give

1085
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,408
I guess the first thing is just to get

1086
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:24,828
the data forced and then we can then

1087
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:28,828
decide what to do with it

1088
01:08:24,828 --> 01:08:30,299
Thomas Eckert CSI the initials when we

1089
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:32,339
started out there were questions and I

1090
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:34,259
haven't been able to catch up with the

1091
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:36,179
latest date of this for the last two a

1092
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:38,519
month and I'm kind of thinking that you

1093
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:40,319
know at some point in time my function

1094
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:41,670
of is something ripe enough or not is

1095
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,679
also there is a time factor II said

1096
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,809
somewhat hamon to say go forward minutes

1097
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,880
distributed but I'll certainly do

1098
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:49,739
another run through it yeah there was

1099
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,389
also when when we started this one of

1100
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:55,468
the interesting question and that's why

1101
01:08:53,389 --> 01:09:00,078
there was specifically the question

1102
01:08:55,469 --> 01:09:02,519
there about execute note you know

1103
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:05,130
membership reports of anybody using them

1104
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:07,139
even at the risk that a good population

1105
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:09,210
will ask our what what is this which

1106
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:11,909
typically would mean no

1107
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:15,448
so exactly to figure out if we could

1108
01:09:11,908 --> 01:09:18,420
reduce ourselves to the lightweight

1109
01:09:15,448 --> 01:09:20,308
model as the future standard at least

1110
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,868
from the requirements perspective right

1111
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:24,150
so I think there is this other round

1112
01:09:21,868 --> 01:09:26,068
that we need to do which is do we really

1113
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:28,318
feel very safe that there is no

1114
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:30,509
interoperability issue right because I

1115
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,539
think my perception would be nobody

1116
01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:36,649
needs for ia pb3 but nobody really has

1117
01:09:33,538 --> 01:09:39,689
widely deployed pure limited IGMP b3

1118
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:41,038
constrained implementations so just

1119
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:42,689
because they would work doesn't mean

1120
01:09:41,038 --> 01:09:44,698
that the protocol the way it's specified

1121
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:46,948
because I think we waived it through

1122
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:49,288
very quickly right when when we did that

1123
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:51,419
protocol I was standing up the right way

1124
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:53,038
yet so when I was standing up and saying

1125
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,690
hey I'm representing one of those

1126
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:56,518
vendors that have implemented all the

1127
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,650
old crap that I know we didn't need but

1128
01:09:56,519 --> 01:10:00,719
you know and now basically you're

1129
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:02,638
challenging me with me having to figure

1130
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,170
out if this is intolerable right but

1131
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:05,460
yeah I don't I don't think more is

1132
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,469
required that's what we're going to

1133
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,989
figure out whether it means it's good

1134
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:12,269
enough to also feel safe that we only

1135
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:13,949
mandate that specification or evidence

1136
01:10:12,269 --> 01:10:16,530
that's another step we can take

1137
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:18,089
afterwards and I think that's a question

1138
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,659
that earlier thinking the draft we also

1139
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:23,519
call I in IGMP v3v to lightweight ask a

1140
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:26,369
question to see what flavor are you

1141
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:28,409
actually rotted right yeah I'm just say

1142
01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:31,710
this because I think there would be a

1143
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:32,820
lot of value in getting rid of all the

1144
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:35,430
crap that was in

1145
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:37,320
that we didn't need because it can make

1146
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:39,390
future implementations a lot easier to

1147
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,870
do and it would be great to get rid of

1148
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:45,840
things like exclude mode and and this is

1149
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:47,340
kind of hitting home because you know

1150
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,950
I'm working with somebody who ended up

1151
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:53,600
having to write an IGMP implementation

1152
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:56,519
for VLC to get a MT gateway into VLC and

1153
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,650
you know that was part of it was what is

1154
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,140
this exclude mode crap but we'll have to

1155
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:02,700
do this it would be really good give

1156
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,790
guidance especially to people outside of

1157
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:12,300
this room what actually is needed so ok

1158
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:15,150
this is good work and I would say sure

1159
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:17,820
but to the to the to the team working on

1160
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:19,860
this I would say you know be brutal and

1161
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:23,610
cut you know don't be afraid to cut

1162
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:25,889
things you're adequately it's just what

1163
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:28,769
question so basically if we cut out

1164
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:30,660
questions that allow us to conclude that

1165
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:32,400
we don't need exclude mode I think we're

1166
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:35,400
doing a bad job because then we can't

1167
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:38,129
come to the conclusion right so and the

1168
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,019
question if you find a way to make the

1169
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:41,910
question of whether we need expert mode

1170
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:45,000
or not in a way that most people in the

1171
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:47,760
world understand it please write because

1172
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I mean we just put in you know do you

1173
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:53,790
use expert mode yes I I know a lot of

1174
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,470
people won't understand it but what's

1175
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,880
what's the best question how we can come

1176
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:59,580
to the conclusion that I think you and I

1177
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,530
want so please review the question say

1178
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,940
that let's get it out that it has all

1179
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,440
the important things you think need to

1180
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,120
be in there and cutting down the

1181
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,089
software afterwards that's after we get

1182
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:13,740
the feedback that's all those are first

1183
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:15,420
Truman is just a survey step 1 although

1184
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:19,469
framing the question to get answer the

1185
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:23,150
you want seems a bit controversial

1186
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:25,590
actually doesn't this point of a survey

1187
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:27,900
same things in the way but you get the

1188
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:32,910
answer that you want I'm just joking oh

1189
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:34,349
just a joke it's ok no that doesn't mean

1190
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:36,570
that we're not trying to do an honest

1191
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:38,550
job of representing really what what the

1192
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:40,530
community is telling us back right so

1193
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,220
even if we don't like the answer I'm

1194
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:45,380
just joking

1195
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:47,750
yeah so the way I see it is you know the

1196
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,820
the RFC might have multiple features

1197
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:52,040
exclude mode is just one of them

1198
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:54,769
and there might be many small details

1199
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,750
like fallback unique house messages or

1200
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:58,070
other things and every every one of

1201
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,530
those different things you should

1202
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:03,559
ideally get some input people are using

1203
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:05,809
them or not and then it can decide later

1204
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,150
and based on what we get can this be

1205
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:10,100
removed from the spec with I should say

1206
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:13,179
and so but right now it's just about

1207
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:17,510
asking the right questions yeah hi

1208
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:18,710
future way I have a question I'm not an

1209
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:24,130
implementer I have a question about

1210
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:24,130
adding stuff so you're asking there if

1211
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:32,270
you're asking there if you should

1212
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:36,620
inquire about only things that are

1213
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:38,930
defined in RFC s or other stuff how much

1214
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:41,090
other stuff is out there is there a lot

1215
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:44,600
of people have implemented that are not

1216
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:46,640
really documented that you might come

1217
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,190
back and say look at this you know 90%

1218
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:53,570
of people reply that they do snooping

1219
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:55,910
proxy okay but so stupid proxy example

1220
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:57,019
is knowing the RFC correct so if their

1221
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,700
goal is to see if you want to take the

1222
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:01,340
RFC and you want to kind of distill it

1223
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:04,730
down should you then include things are

1224
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:06,950
not in that RFC well it's an open VC

1225
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:10,099
right so it's wrong I'm concerned about

1226
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:14,690
the other way which is if there are many

1227
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:17,000
features out in the field that are not

1228
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:19,669
documented I'm assuming that one of the

1229
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,680
reasons to ask maybe to document them at

1230
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,300
some point

1231
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:25,160
so yeah soon the survey we've we've got

1232
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,300
a couple of open-ended question let me

1233
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,920
get to that but there's a specific

1234
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,860
question that you think we should add

1235
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,480
either so we do have a couple of

1236
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:34,099
questions saying you know would you like

1237
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,349
would you not like about the protocol

1238
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,520
what some of the challenges but we could

1239
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:42,080
add a question to this thing I've ever

1240
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:43,670
featured that you don't use or in many

1241
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,530
ways if we have a if we have a what we

1242
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:47,030
think is a definitive list of all the

1243
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:48,980
possible features whether or not they're

1244
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:51,050
in the RFC and we could put them in the

1245
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:52,280
survey then we could but because you

1246
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:53,510
know what I'm thinking is that if there

1247
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,800
are other features that are not defined

1248
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:57,310
in our seats you know maybe that means

1249
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,640
work for the work but on one hand

1250
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:03,460
on the other hand maybe and this is just

1251
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:06,040
a maybe what the team needs to consider

1252
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,620
is whether the specification is actually

1253
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:11,290
complete or if there are other features

1254
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:12,849
need to go in there now if you decide

1255
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:15,820
that if we get to if we even get to the

1256
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:18,670
point we're ready to balance the

1257
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:21,099
internet standard versus adding

1258
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:23,950
functionality right so if I understand

1259
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:26,440
correctly for the way to become internet

1260
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:28,690
standard we can't add in a new stuff

1261
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:32,830
right all we can do is take stuff away

1262
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:34,900
clarify things so I don't remember

1263
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:36,850
exactly the text but I'm assuming that

1264
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:40,059
it says something that it can't have too

1265
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:44,410
many changes which probably means that

1266
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:46,380
it's safe to take stuff away but it

1267
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:52,210
probably comes from what you take away

1268
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:54,190
and I don't know I mean it would be hard

1269
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:59,170
to say if you take half the RFC away is

1270
01:15:54,190 --> 01:16:00,759
that okay right so in the same way if

1271
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:04,450
you add something that now it is

1272
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:06,130
something that is actually used then it

1273
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:07,870
might be okay as well I guess the main

1274
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:09,610
thing is whatever we add needs to be

1275
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:12,190
very mature right something that has

1276
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:15,160
been widely used while implemented right

1277
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:18,820
I mean you know right now well yes we're

1278
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:20,800
just assuming things but we're gonna

1279
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:23,860
have to think about those questions yeah

1280
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,660
but but the point is I guess yeah is it

1281
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:28,960
useful for us to find out about

1282
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:31,660
additional stuff doesn't make the story

1283
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:37,300
better or more confusing more is it good

1284
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:39,370
info for us to have well my thought

1285
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:41,890
process was framing the initial

1286
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:44,080
questions so reverse engineering what is

1287
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:46,770
the output for the progression of the

1288
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,450
standards that we can do right so and

1289
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:51,400
that's when basically your points came

1290
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:52,870
in in the first round of review right

1291
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,599
what is the input that we need to

1292
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:58,450
elevate ijen pv3 to a full standard or

1293
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,580
IGMP v3 light what questions do we need

1294
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:02,860
to distinguish which of the two could be

1295
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:04,420
elevated to that right and so all the

1296
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,219
stuff like what would the other cool

1297
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,440
stuff to make people more happy would be

1298
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,570
certainly on a on a degree lower because

1299
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,119
it wouldn't help us to elevate to a

1300
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,799
fuller

1301
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:14,389
it's something else the nitrogen pv-1

1302
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,979
that we have so that's still kind of the

1303
01:17:14,389 --> 01:17:20,949
most limited scope and you know if we

1304
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:23,329
manage after ten years to have one

1305
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:24,799
questionnaire out maybe we have in one

1306
01:17:23,329 --> 01:17:27,590
or two years another questionnaire out

1307
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,909
for pool additional stuff but and maybe

1308
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,469
we should track it right now right I

1309
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:32,598
mean if people have these interesting

1310
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:34,340
questions and we just feel that they're

1311
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:38,389
just you know scope low we will just

1312
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:40,550
check them otherwise so um so I think

1313
01:17:38,389 --> 01:17:43,399
you want to send out this survey fairly

1314
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:47,090
soon so it's a big creative people can

1315
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:48,739
review the questions and and we cut it's

1316
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:51,649
a lot of work to get this survey out to

1317
01:17:48,739 --> 01:17:53,178
people and get their responses so we

1318
01:17:51,649 --> 01:17:55,939
should make sure that they ask the right

1319
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:58,550
questions before we do it but they also

1320
01:17:55,939 --> 01:18:01,070
want to move on with this and I think

1321
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:02,619
one of the key question to the community

1322
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:05,058
here in the room and the mailing list is

1323
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:06,768
whom whom else could we send it out

1324
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:09,110
alright I think we have a couple of

1325
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:11,510
usual suspect like you know it in a to

1326
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,280
mailing list in the u.s. some many news

1327
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,949
people no equivalent in the research

1328
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,749
base in Europe maybe accelerators people

1329
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:20,959
that work with a lot of customers so

1330
01:18:17,749 --> 01:18:22,610
anybody who has an idea on whom to send

1331
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:24,530
it to please do it by yourself and if

1332
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:26,119
you don't want to do it by yourself give

1333
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:27,800
the suggestion home to send it and it

1334
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:31,610
will repeat the question on the mist

1335
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:33,679
right so basically well we'll have I'm

1336
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:36,018
not sure exactly how we plan to do it if

1337
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:41,840
it will be like a PDF or some document

1338
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:44,149
or a URL somewhere but we want to help I

1339
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,189
mean yeah want everyone to contribute to

1340
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:48,439
distributing this is hard to reach out

1341
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:52,039
to all the customers and the prices and

1342
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:54,619
so on so yeah basically wants everyone

1343
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:59,179
knows someone to just spread this as

1344
01:18:54,619 --> 01:19:01,188
widely as possible but yeah money little

1345
01:18:59,179 --> 01:19:03,349
bits how you will send it out I mean

1346
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:05,689
would just be like forwarding an email

1347
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:09,499
with my attachments or pointing to a web

1348
01:19:05,689 --> 01:19:13,209
page somewhere or so I was it done when

1349
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:17,179
this guy mr. Venus was doing it for him

1350
01:19:13,209 --> 01:19:20,090
right yeah I can try to figure out what

1351
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:21,379
we did for what you were just mentioning

1352
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:23,989
in terms of having it on a web page

1353
01:19:21,379 --> 01:19:24,980
obviously you know allows people to go

1354
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:26,660
back later on and

1355
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,309
you know potential we can have an update

1356
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,680
or a status report or something right

1357
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:32,570
they whoever kind of gets involved in

1358
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:35,360
the process has a more direct point to

1359
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:37,309
go to and so that what even if you

1360
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:41,000
haven't done it in PIM it might be good

1361
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:42,860
idea to basically point to a URL yeah I

1362
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,050
mean yeah the reason I'm saying it is

1363
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:47,179
you want people to you know forward

1364
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:50,030
emails or so on forward request their

1365
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:54,140
requests but attachments might get lost

1366
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:58,009
in the process or something so I was on

1367
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:02,140
all the exact same process when we get

1368
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:06,050
them you know to enter in standard and

1369
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:09,500
as far as I know us Jeffrey as far as I

1370
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:11,030
remember we created a survey monkey or

1371
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:15,370
something like that

1372
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:18,469
survey and then Center the link

1373
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:21,410
obviously due to the participant so and

1374
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:23,990
then somebody was responsible for

1375
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:27,349
collecting the data and then anonymizing

1376
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:30,500
it and so forth so I think that was the

1377
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:32,810
option we used right yeah and the the

1378
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:35,090
same person that collected those

1379
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:37,310
responses and anonymized them last time

1380
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:42,320
it's also volunteering to do it this

1381
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:45,590
time right did Tim then do all the job

1382
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:48,980
to set up the Survey Monkey I think that

1383
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:50,600
team did I think he just had an account

1384
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:53,929
or whatever I could collect the results

1385
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:55,850
that's my understanding but yeah great

1386
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:59,690
if you can actually discuss with Rishabh

1387
01:20:55,850 --> 01:21:01,250
and jeffrey here and buddy and what

1388
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:04,400
you're asking from you guys

1389
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:07,730
now i would say is this reviewed our

1390
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,230
questions and if they if you have any

1391
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:11,809
questions to add if you find some

1392
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:14,660
questions confusing or that they could

1393
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:18,290
be improved or whatever we need all

1394
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:21,860
input we can get to make them that the

1395
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:24,800
best possible and then I think hopefully

1396
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:28,309
sometime before the next ITF we want to

1397
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:32,900
send this out and we would unlike you

1398
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:35,639
all to help us distribute this yeah

1399
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:39,480
does that sound reasonable

1400
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:44,760
thank you any other comments all right

1401
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:48,900
