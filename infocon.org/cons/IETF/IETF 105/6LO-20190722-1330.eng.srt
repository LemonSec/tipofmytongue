the way you recall that the ideas taking

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,230
notes of the main points of the

24
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,690
discussions the main outcomes the main

25
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,200
action points that not everything that's

being said in any case I understand that

27
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,520
the minute taking process will take

28
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,980
place on the etherpad so feel free to

29
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,120
join the etherpad and contribute to the

30
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,670
collaborative effort of militating so on

31
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,970
the slide you can find a number of

32
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:41,000
pointers to relevant resources which are

33
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:44,800
the online agenda the Java room the

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,800
mythical and the etherpad

35
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:53,270
this is the note well please make sure

36
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:57,470
that you have read it it contains a

37
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,780
number of pointers to policies ITF

38
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,130
policies on important topics so please

39
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,570
make sure that you have familiar with it

40
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,990
and now let's go through the agenda for

41
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,880
today

42
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:12,590
so the first slot is the usual chairs

43
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,820
introduction that's currently in

44
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,429
progress then the next slot is the

45
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,530
presentation of the ipv6 over NFC

46
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,510
document basically the revisions after

47
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:29,390
the ISDN evaluation next initially there

48
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,120
was scheduled the presentation by

49
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,510
Charlie about the deadline time draft

50
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,650
also the revisions after is devaluation

51
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:42,770
however he will present this remotely

52
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,780
and he will do it at the end of the

53
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,270
session

54
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,570
because of some unexpected issues that

55
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,030
have a beard so unless there's any

56
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,260
objection the idea the proposal would be

57
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,969
to move

58
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:00,430
Charlie's slot to the end of the session

59
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,620
after that the next presentation will be

60
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,820
given by Pascal this will be a status

61
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,280
report of the fragmentation drafts and

62
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,560
then there will be the presentation of

63
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,590
the status report and next steps for the

64
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:21,520
applicability and use cases document by

65
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:24,070
eun-geum then there will be a set of two

66
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,289
presentations that are related with

67
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,980
neighbor discovery that will be given by

68
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,500
Pascal starting actually by the second

69
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,750
one so it's not the same order that's

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,900
shown here if there's no objection

71
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,160
so the first will be the maintenance

72
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,190
proportional tenant scheme for RFC

73
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,160
eighty five zero five and next there

74
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:48,419
will be the any and the unicast lookup

75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,070
and by the way since we have some

76
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,580
available time unless there's any

77
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:59,460
objection the slot for the unicast

78
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:01,960
lookup would also be of 15 minutes

79
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,630
finally there will be the presentation

80
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,180
of new work which is a new method for

81
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,909
header compression given by Brian and

82
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,810
the related document is entitled a

83
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:17,410
symmetric ipv6 for IOT networks and as I

84
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,610
said before actually the last slot will

85
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,760
be the one by charlie

86
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,310
unless there's any problem so is there

87
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:32,870
any comment on the agenda considering

88
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:36,139
these proposed changes okay

89
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,630
thank you so now let's go through a

90
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:42,350
status report of the working group

91
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:45,590
documents we have two documents that

92
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:49,400
have been evaluated by the iesg these

93
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,130
are the ipv6 over NFC and the deadline

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,500
time documents there was a number of

95
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,280
outstanding discuss positions on both

96
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:02,300
and both documents were updated before

97
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,609
the cutoff date and the next step will

98
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,639
be seeing whether the updates are

99
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,310
sufficient to satisfactorily address the

100
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,100
comments that were made you can see on

101
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:18,919
the slide a summary of the iesg

102
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:21,110
ballots as they are today and there was

103
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,919
a another document that was submitted to

104
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,139
the ASG

105
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,210
however it hasn't been yet evaluated by

106
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:30,440
the SD which is the address protected

107
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:33,020
maybe discovery draft then there's a set

108
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,240
of four other documents that passed

109
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,039
working group last call the first two

110
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,240
are the documents that are related with

111
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,098
fragmentation and these are the six open

112
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,430
fragment forwarding and the fragment

113
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,520
recovery documents for this the Sheppard

114
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,709
review has been done and both documents

115
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,380
have been updated in fact this morning

116
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:57,589
that there has been the publication of

117
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,720
the new revisions and the comments that

118
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:04,070
were given by the Shepherd are addressed

119
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,140
by the new update then there are two

120
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,450
other documents that passed working

121
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,939
robles call one is the ipv6 backbone

122
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,390
router for this we requested a review

123
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,360
from six men and actually this morning

124
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,279
one reviewer from six man agreed to do

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,180
this review and provide the review in

126
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:26,330
3-4 weeks and the other document is ipv6

127
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,010
mesh over ble links for which a shepherd

128
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,480
was assigned and the next step will be

129
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:34,490
getting the shepherd review and write-up

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,890
then there are two other working group

131
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,320
documents that have not been updated

132
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:43,040
since brac first is the six low

133
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,270
applicability and use cases draft as you

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,610
may recall there was a working group

135
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:51,019
last call help for this document

136
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,610
which however ended without feedback so

137
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,410
today there will be some time for

138
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,759
discussion of the current status and

139
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,649
next steps for this document and finally

140
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:04,100
the last working group document is ipv6

141
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:06,019
over PLC which as you may recall was

142
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,660
adopted as a working group document

143
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:11,929
before brac and however has not been

144
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,899
updated since then so perhaps is there

145
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:17,149
any author of this document that would

146
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:37,069
like to express anything on the mic

147
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:40,549
about current status and next steps okay

148
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:45,979
Romania from Hawaii one of the authors

149
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:48,199
of the ipv6 over PLC so before this

150
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,579
meeting we have not got a chance to

151
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:56,779
update the draft so we will update the

152
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,910
draft just after this this ITF meeting

153
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:04,569
and we will come to the mailing list for

154
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,569
comments okay okay thank you very much

155
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,550
so is there any comment on this

156
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,660
presentation

157
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,660
[Music]

158
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:25,459
okay then we can move to the next slot

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,639
which would be the presentation of ipv6

160
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:47,388
over NFC basically the report of the

161
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:50,329
revisions after the ISDN evaluation yes

162
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:53,089
this is the Abbate to drop the number 14

163
00:11:50,329 --> 00:12:08,240
and 15 I should I should I proposed to

164
00:11:53,089 --> 00:12:12,380
judgment okay this is the every time I

165
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,050
show you the kick into Shibata NFC this

166
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,980
one is the history and has status up to

167
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,729
my trust

168
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:23,089
actually there was the I GS he reviews

169
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,240
on March I have a lot of critical

170
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:29,329
discussion and then I produced the 14

171
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,189
and 15 draft version and for this

172
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:38,060
meeting I will give you some kick okay

173
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:40,219
insertion to preview the five slides

174
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,819
the first one is marketing is pressure

175
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:48,079
actually there was some something

176
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:50,889
marketing stuff might route something

177
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,839
special is not really good so I just

178
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:57,079
reword all the all of them with the only

179
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,750
technical Cuban point and something some

180
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:04,609
on the others or not relevant keyword is

181
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:08,149
removed Oh church chairman the color or

182
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,660
Hamas and Israel huh me thank you

183
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:16,699
and another one is a total changes your

184
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:25,130
whole judgment and difficult to some

185
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:28,529
typos and syntax and RFC 21 9 1-1 92119

186
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,589
issue here some a lot of may

187
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:33,660
and some shoes or something I just

188
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:35,850
removed all the main and I changes this

189
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,209
one something to mask something like

190
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,290
that

191
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:42,959
Thanks and the next one is upper section

192
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:47,219
3004 sec stubble and heel and the

193
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,829
example of the extension option issues

194
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:53,279
there was some leave you about the body

195
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:58,349
stand and mi you sure it is actually the

196
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:02,129
same as MTU in the NFC site so I just

197
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:07,110
put the npu in the front of the occasion

198
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:11,699
and I leave I for the figure number two

199
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:15,480
the for education like that next one is

200
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:18,689
the section for thought one about the

201
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,209
figures racially this one this figure is

202
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:23,910
actually something some part make show

203
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:26,609
it the physical and ink layer is

204
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:30,240
redundant to the ticket figure number

205
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,120
two so the viewer gave me the third

206
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,339
suggestion make this one another with

207
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,980
new figure I just simplified this one

208
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:42,000
like the new figure I think it's better

209
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:46,920
and this one is the about the nd section

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,559
the 4.5 there was some typos and some

211
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,259
major changes and rise to sentence a

212
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:55,589
sure it is not really refer to under

213
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:59,430
since fight so I just decided to leave

214
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:03,540
it this is okay thank you and next one

215
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:08,008
is the last one actually it is of a

216
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:14,849
security section um the review gave me t

217
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:18,209
the last second the sentence this one

218
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,059
actually he given me the suggestion this

219
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:23,279
sentence should be go to the front in

220
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,759
this D section so I just accepted one

221
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,009
and the next the second the power of

222
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,309
actually is not really clear because

223
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:37,170
this is final version so I just remove

224
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:40,379
it and the the last section it tells to

225
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,709
leave you give me some division

226
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,860
divides the text

227
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:48,130
just I accept that the they weren't just

228
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,990
I put his suggestion thank you this is

229
00:15:48,130 --> 00:16:17,890
the end the end case on their comment

230
00:15:49,990 --> 00:16:26,529
thank you thanks so much so basically by

231
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:28,120
Cisco so we have so we have done some

232
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,760
work of all that ten years on fragments

233
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,160
at six slow initially it started with a

234
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,069
very simple fragmentation mechanism

235
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,620
whereby you just cut message in pieces

236
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,870
and throw the pieces but we would not

237
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,720
discuss if there is any primer flow

238
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,310
control with those pieces if there is

239
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,670
any crime of interaction between the

240
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:52,569
previous pieces as they get forwarded

241
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,310
about the network like hidden terminal

242
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,640
issues between various fragments things

243
00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:01,810
like that and we did not even discuss

244
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:05,109
how fragments could be forwarded without

245
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,059
react reassembly at every hub so the

246
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,819
assumption was fragments would be

247
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,678
various about every hub so we looked at

248
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,209
it in this working group and found that

249
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
you could actually get a better result

250
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,220
if you would streamline the forwarding

251
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,920
of fragments but there are rules in

252
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,510
order to do that unless otherwise you

253
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,850
get interactions between the fragments

254
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,189
and you lose a lot of them so we we

255
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,199
ended up with one document in this group

256
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,690
and Gaston wrote another document that

257
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,620
week when we explained how without

258
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:38,050
changing the formats in 49:44 you can

259
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,389
actually avoid reassembling the packet

260
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:44,200
at every hop but forward the fragment

261
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,270
over Helios free path over multi hops so

262
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,760
the technique is effectively documented

263
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,980
in this minimal fragment raft so

264
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,520
mini-mall doesn't change the formats of

265
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,470
RC 49:34 it just explains the rule

266
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,070
which must follow if you want to avoid

267
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,260
some mistakes which would be proud so

268
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,350
it's mostly an internal operation by the

269
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,440
node how to perform the fragment

270
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,540
forwarding correctly now we are still in

271
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,330
a world where the fragments are sent

272
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,190
once and for all and you expect that all

273
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,500
the fragments would be received on the

274
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,450
other side if they are not there is no

275
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,200
way for the sender to know about this

276
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,240
apart from timing out at the upper layer

277
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,690
which means that if a fragment is lost

278
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,600
the receiver will wait till death with

279
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,610
this buffer locked with a big message in

280
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,439
it so it's a big buffer and you have to

281
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,169
wait till a timeout of minutes

282
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,280
before you can release the buffer

283
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,190
meaning that and that happened actually

284
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,379
that you're you run out of buffer for

285
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,400
any normal non fragmented traffic and

286
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,690
now your throughput goes down

287
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,110
dramatically so what we did for that is

288
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:57,100
we looked at the primes of

289
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,699
retransmitting individual fragments and

290
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,929
so for that

291
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,960
that's the third draft that the

292
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:07,490
fragments recovery draft and we also

293
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,050
looked at questions like how what kind

294
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,510
of interval you need to place between

295
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,950
packets to make sure which between

296
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,270
fragments to make sure that the next

297
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,050
fragment does not interfere with the

298
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,850
previous fragment so there we go these

299
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,090
are the this is the history of what we

300
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,639
are doing so 49 40 44 is quite old now

301
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,919
but those two are just completing well

302
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,390
group let's go as carelessness just told

303
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:35,300
us so the changes in minimum fragments

304
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:38,210
we had some commands we had to to great

305
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,000
reviews by yeah and and jojos thank you

306
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,920
dojo so they don't see ya in the room oh

307
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,040
yes thank you yet so and then we get

308
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,290
your ratio commas so with this way we

309
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,620
can have removed some claims which were

310
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,658
not too useful like the size of the

311
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,158
future recovery before a reassembly

312
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,039
buffer because it depends on

313
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,720
implementation no but we we clarified

314
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:08,629
the abstract content that we expect to

315
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,749
find here we added a section in the

316
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:14,480
security section about the attacks

317
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:16,759
against the VRB and and what is the

318
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,519
exposure and the exposure is not that

319
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,379
big because you don't keep much data for

320
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,509
each individual fragments right so it's

321
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:25,850
a very small data per fragment so you

322
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:28,309
can still be attacked in the middle of

323
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,248
the network by you throwing at you many

324
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,690
fragments of fake fragments which appear

325
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:34,879
to come from different data ground so

326
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,129
which you need to create a V or B but it

327
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:42,428
takes many of those packets before it

328
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:44,600
starts representing a lot of memory we

329
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,639
improved the cloud the quality of the

330
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,899
tags that says how you manage the vrb is

331
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:54,289
like when you create them when you

332
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:56,059
discard them and yes we we clarified

333
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:58,850
things which were not written correctly

334
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:01,039
or not free obvious you only wrote on

335
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,110
the first fragment the operation that

336
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,720
you do for forwarding fragment is create

337
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:09,469
a form of MPLS State you use the

338
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,559
Datagram tag as an MPLS label and the

339
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:15,200
first really as it is the first fragment

340
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,529
is routed by the IP header and you lay

341
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,690
out the fragment as you go the label as

342
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,669
you go and then the other fragments

343
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,409
follow the label path and you actually

344
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,389
switch the data gram tag as if it was a

345
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,639
label how by hop and that's how you

346
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:32,779
avoid some collisions that we described

347
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:34,219
in this in this group so these are the

348
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,490
challenges for the fragment falling

349
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:40,429
thing the farmers recovery follows the

350
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,289
same logic for the initial path that is

351
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:45,350
created by the first fragment based on

352
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:49,399
the IP address what it doesn't up is

353
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,070
provide a bitmap each bit in the bitmap

354
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:53,719
of acknowledgment bitmap tells you about

355
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,710
one individual fragment so you can

356
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,509
actually

357
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,929
retry any particular fragment

358
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:03,619
individually so you've got rules on how

359
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:04,879
you manage the Internet via bees and you

360
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,590
find that because you have this

361
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:08,370
additional signaling the management of

362
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,678
the BMV RB can be bad

363
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,360
for instance you know when the receiver

364
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,159
has fully received all the fragments

365
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,870
that's when you can destroy the VRP

366
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,610
you don't know that if you don't have

367
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,100
acknowledgements oh it's an addition to

368
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,260
the text that could exist in the normal

369
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,120
fragment fording so we discuss with

370
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,760
we've the chair here with a shepherd

371
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,908
actually shepherd on whether that meant

372
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,090
an update of the other spec or just an

373
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,860
extension and we found that it's not

374
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,570
real dating the other draft because the

375
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,740
methods we are hiding come with the fact

376
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,379
that we are hiding something in the

377
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,770
protocol as well so so we didn't write

378
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,450
update we wrote extend that we did not

379
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,240
indicate in the Arab theatre that we

380
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:52,230
update minimal fragment with the

381
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:57,960
recoverable one at the definition

382
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:59,880
clarify number of things we also added

383
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,429
the IANA section it was missing oh it

384
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,770
was there it was empty so thank you

385
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:06,539
Oh getting this one so yes now we have

386
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:12,149
an inner section and that's part of what

387
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:15,360
was published this morning and that's

388
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:17,820
your question no that's not a question

389
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,070
I'm here it's hard to find me but yeah

390
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,870
so one of the things that you've

391
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,730
identified this is not like just a

392
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,168
problem here this updates thing is an

393
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,230
issue for everybody in the idea of

394
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,789
pretty much like we used the updates tag

395
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,940
to mean different things at different

396
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:35,190
times so a few of us on there years you

397
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,490
have taken upon ourselves to write

398
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:42,649
something to clarify this and just to

399
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,520
give you like a brief intro right like

400
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,870
it's gonna be an individual drafts

401
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,970
coming out right now it's Raleigh today

402
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,500
or tomorrow it'll be out you want to

403
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,610
replace the updates tag with something

404
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,770
else okay

405
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,209
so right now the goals are like one of

406
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,370
them is like you know it changes things

407
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,649
or adds things like so we want to

408
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,330
separate these things out so like what

409
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:03,389
the update means is gonna become clearer

410
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:06,029
that's really the goal I think like by

411
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,980
this time this like hits the iesg

412
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,240
you might have this have like a initial

413
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,770
idea of like whether this is gonna fly

414
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,679
or not but it's not probably going to be

415
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,510
final but I think at least like in the

416
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,980
text you could explain how something

417
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,440
abase that's like probably going to be

418
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,789
the stopgap arrangement for going

419
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,700
forward with this right so you just say

420
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,650
okay this is what we do

421
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,990
cuz like like you said right like it's

422
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,920
an it's an extension point so you decide

423
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,320
what to say but so one of the things is

424
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,330
like so if I started digging back a bit

425
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,689
right why do we have an update stag in

426
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:40,480
an RFC right so the thing is like the

427
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:43,660
RFC that got updated right the only way

428
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,190
it can get pretty immutable to point to

429
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,440
something that has more information is

430
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,650
the update stack so I would rather be

431
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,210
like liberal and assigning the tag if

432
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,920
you think is relevant for somebody

433
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,720
reading the updated RFC to read this

434
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,120
that's totally obvious that that's the

435
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,110
point I thought it was not it's not

436
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,639
that's what I'm saying so like I'll

437
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,409
rather be liberal and doing that right

438
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,020
now until we go through this proper

439
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,280
cleanup procedure so just because like

440
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,930
somebody's prolly gonna ask like

441
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,910
somewhere down the line right like and I

442
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,220
would rather be liberal here and then

443
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,660
remove it if somebody says like why does

444
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,490
it do it as long as you explain it I

445
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,040
think they're gonna be okay yes and so

446
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,660
weird and I guess this case is one you

447
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,730
could have in your thought process as

448
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,340
you define these new tags because in

449
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,100
this case the minimum is still self

450
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,260
sufficient the addition don't need to be

451
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,020
known by somebody wins does mini-mall

452
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,370
for RC 49:44 this is a closed world that

453
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,400
it's enough and there is nothing to add

454
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,689
to it yes sorry it's already thought off

455
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,280
so that's why I've just wait for the

456
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,750
draft it's low it's noisy out today or

457
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,270
tomorrow so like it is like something

458
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,610
that's a use case for like the new tags

459
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,129
okay but you see the you see the point

460
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,719
right the update if it was does not

461
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,920
actually need to be known but by the

462
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,600
reader of the other one because the

463
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,240
update comes with what comes with this

464
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:01,230
draft itself also self sufficient so

465
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:04,510
that's why I went from not updating good

466
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,250
so yes the thank you very much to the

467
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:11,260
Shepherd for both document who happens

468
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:14,530
to be careless here and as you said so

469
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,250
we all we all set for for the int real

470
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,250
review I guess

471
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,210
forwarding fragments as we go to the

472
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,989
next slide where is more complex that

473
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,210
meets the eye

474
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,950
because if you if you just push the

475
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,710
fragments bang bang bang bang and you

476
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,970
operate your mesh on a single frequency

477
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,800
clearly the first fragment as it

478
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,630
progresses from the first to the second

479
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,940
half well for the second to the third

480
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,250
hub will collision on the second hub

481
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,050
with the second fragment which comes

482
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,970
from the first up to the second hub it's

483
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,620
like because you think you forward in

484
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,360
this way actually because the radio is

485
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,300
broadcast it's also for us the other way

486
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,310
and the to interfere so you get

487
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,260
immediately hidden terminal and the

488
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,179
second hop loses the second packets

489
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,040
basically so it's something that that

490
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,230
forces you to pace down your fragment

491
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,110
it's something you need to know now if

492
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:11,710
you operate on different channels like

493
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,149
you use the ACH for instance the the you

494
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,700
still need to pace a little bit down

495
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:19,150
because when this the second fragment is

496
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,190
sailed the receiver on this on the

497
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,140
second heart must be open for receiving

498
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,650
meaning that it must already have sent

499
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,780
the first fragment so the center of the

500
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,640
second fragment must wait till the

501
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,310
receiver of the first fragment has done

502
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,530
transmitted transmitting right so you

503
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,790
still need to insert some time here even

504
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,889
if you don't have hidden terminal

505
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,409
problems because there you need to be

506
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,780
able to turn the receiver horn on this

507
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,180
on the receiver so it must have sailed

508
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:52,950
the first fragment so it are a lot of

509
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:52,950
non-obvious things like this there we go

510
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:15,559
okay hi my name is Jung Hwan home I will

511
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:16,729
present the sixth row applicability and

512
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,178
Yusuke document

513
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:25,220
so actually artists raft was not update

514
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:27,860
after last primary about we have our

515
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,879
email discussion or between the authors

516
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:35,389
and we have some the block consists of a

517
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:38,889
lot conclusion how to improve and help

518
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:43,820
to update his trip so this time I will

519
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:47,029
shortly it is described all result of

520
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:51,129
the email discussion shown the first one

521
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:54,200
is the also always to adjust the scope

522
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:57,980
because the comment come from the last

523
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:01,419
meeting so we will under or down and the

524
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:06,350
pro course on and we found there some

525
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:08,749
section was not considered between each

526
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:13,879
section so we make confidence between

527
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:16,129
each section and we debating total

528
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:18,590
determine the six row technology

529
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:22,189
the first one is LT empty C is removed

530
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:25,399
already but we are considering how about

531
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:29,059
handling the I Triple E area to that 15

532
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:33,590
the poor technology because Arab see six

533
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:37,428
five six eight already provide 6lowpan

534
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:40,999
use cases but in this prep thought are

535
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:44,029
typical on deployment of the six row and

536
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:46,269
it is the Jupiter mesh and whites on the

537
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:49,700
two technology is our typical

538
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:52,879
six royalty premiere scenario and it is

539
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:56,509
based on a decrypting the poor

540
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:58,730
technology and another technology is a

541
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:03,649
triple aerial to the attenti

542
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:06,460
echo technology or is I remember that it

543
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:09,469
come from the Samhita comments M it has

544
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,889
suggested a triple-a area to that

545
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:15,470
pivotal echo is also related to a six

546
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:18,498
row so it is better to include a

547
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:22,460
technology for now thought rap is a

548
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:24,470
little too big so we must delete remove

549
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,380
it is not important in Section so one of

550
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:31,040
the technologies I through the editor

551
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,810
type in that equity canal see just a

552
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,149
mention that for he has been wrapped

553
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,240
into fifteen fourths which is part of 15

554
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:40,520
for now the one you mentioned why

555
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,680
centripetal measure in the four chief

556
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,620
Remini world the Phi is actually

557
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:48,350
subdeacon you go wrong distance whereas

558
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:51,199
for he was in the Y could be used for 4G

559
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,090
but it's Annabel Mac technology like TCH

560
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,310
density general being is part of the for

561
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,590
he amendment no it's all wrapped up into

562
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,580
54 so it there's no reason to mention

563
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:03,100
for he anymore

564
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:05,990
okay thank you and the other or

565
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,990
conclusion is that we would remove the

566
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,270
section five point one the title is the

567
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:15,110
design space dimension POSIX wrote

568
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:18,470
implement so you know you are RFC sixty

569
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:22,280
five six eight it includes design space

570
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:25,040
based on the city open technology but

571
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,010
are we identifier another design space

572
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:31,070
dimension po6 wrote deployment because

573
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:34,460
sixth row technology include a wider

574
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:37,639
technology for example the net world PFC

575
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:42,610
so it there will be a different or

576
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:45,650
design space or design space dimension

577
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,439
but we found that each region space

578
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:52,130
dimension is not laced to each six

579
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:57,050
rhotic analogy so to narrow down this

580
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:59,450
rep we would like to remove the section

581
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,090
five point one so if we have any

582
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:08,030
comments or any questions so let us know

583
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:08,720
then we consider how to adjust the scope

584
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:13,060
of this

585
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,060
trapped okay the short thank you

586
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,880
Carlos Gomez as a coaster I think well

587
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,879
if you go back to the previous slide I

588
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:34,860
think the last point is the clearest

589
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,940
action that we can do it doesn't hurt if

590
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:42,179
we remove subsection 5.1 all together

591
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:46,500
then the one in the middle is a bit more

592
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:49,680
tricky there's the question of currently

593
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,550
in the description of technologies we

594
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,860
have subsection 4 15.4 II the question

595
00:32:53,550 --> 00:33:00,990
might be ok should we have a section

596
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:03,689
subsection dedicated to 15.4 in general

597
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:07,080
perhaps yes also Pascal just mentioned

598
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:11,070
that now for e4g are integrated anyway

599
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:14,760
in 1504 although that might open a bit

600
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:19,889
the scope as well so that's a little bit

601
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:23,850
tricky okay then so right now I haven't

602
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:27,930
no answer to to your kitchen so ok I

603
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:32,780
think about how to handle that issue ok

604
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,780
then another question on the climatic

605
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,199
question to the authors how do you want

606
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,040
to progress it was in workgroup last

607
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,330
call's we didn't we didn't submit it

608
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,370
back we didn't get any comments we

609
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,070
didn't submit it to the IHC review so

610
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:48,300
how do you want to proceed it you want

611
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,520
to devise the raft and go for another

612
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:53,700
workgroup last call or you want to

613
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,639
gather some thoughts from the workgroup

614
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,200
now to see if there is interest in

615
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,970
actually progressing this draft and see

616
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,040
if there is an archival value for this

617
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,830
job at this point okay

618
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:09,659
let me answer so my plan is to update a

619
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:12,810
strap and then we hope to ask a command

620
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:18,859
from this six row and then we will ask

621
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:18,860
the working last quote ok ok thank you

622
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:36,279
ask Olivia so this is an update that I

623
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,530
prepared not for this group actually but

624
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,810
for six man but then talking with the

625
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,909
chairs we we thought were Levin to to

626
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:45,429
give this group an update on it because

627
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:48,580
it reveals on what we have produced in

628
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:52,000
six low and that now may continue its

629
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,590
life at six man so for those who did not

630
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,710
follow the story now is your chance to

631
00:34:53,590 --> 00:35:02,740
to get to get it kind of the full full

632
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:05,020
story of wireless indie so in the

633
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,629
actually the the work we started with

634
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,620
RFC 6775 which I should have written

635
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:13,740
here so RFC 6775 in twenty five

636
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:17,380
introduced the concept of a registration

637
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,779
which is how a host can tell the router

638
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,180
a I have this IP address so I formed

639
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,940
this IP address can I use it is it

640
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,460
unique in the network etc and the router

641
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,310
using a central registrar we call the

642
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,780
six LVR is capable of saying yes this

643
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,890
address is unique you may use it

644
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:38,230
basically and now the router is and the

645
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,660
6lb are can protect the ownership of

646
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,640
this advice to this host so that was the

647
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,819
beginning of the story of this interface

648
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,770
we mostly can do duplicate a trace

649
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:51,400
detection but there is no security

650
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,020
mechanism to ensure that a bad guy will

651
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,950
not try to register the same address

652
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:59,259
with the same MAC address and still the

653
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:02,470
traffic and be able to sauce traffic on

654
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:06,910
behalf of the other guys so for good

655
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:10,270
willing guys this is dad equivalent what

656
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,339
we have on wire but for attacks it's

657
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,800
just as what we see on wire it's

658
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,940
possible to attack this and claim the

659
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,880
traffic for somebody else

660
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,330
so that's sixty seven twenty five eight

661
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,060
five four five updated this changing

662
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:28,029
little bit the way we use link local

663
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:30,100
drives making it simpler and also

664
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,130
changing which field advertise that so

665
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,118
it's mostly conceptually the same thing

666
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,190
in terms of exact form

667
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,839
mati changes a bit and then we added

668
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,609
something which is important in some

669
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,450
environments which is a sequence counter

670
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:44,710
for instance we refer to this Draft at

671
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,868
five four five in datacenter

672
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,849
applications where VM can be a mess can

673
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:50,499
move and the fact that you have the

674
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:52,059
sequence counter and each time the VM

675
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,549
moves it declares itself to the router

676
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:56,380
then the routing infrastructure alcohol

677
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:59,829
can always know which is the most recent

678
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,599
location for this virtual machine it's a

679
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:03,190
prime we see on wireless it's a crime we

680
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,499
see in the data center I want to know

681
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,720
where everybody is and you want to make

682
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:09,910
sure that we know the latest point of

683
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,709
attachment of that of that address right

684
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,660
so having this sequence counter is

685
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:17,589
actually critical for getting this

686
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:20,828
information tight so that's that like

687
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:22,808
five four five and then there are two

688
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:24,549
drafts which progress pretty much in

689
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,589
parallel to eight five four five the

690
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:28,390
first one is the Badman router so the

691
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:31,859
backbone router and I will have slide on

692
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:35,589
that is really the ND proxy operation

693
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:38,828
that goes with the registration so if

694
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:42,130
you think for a minute of what 802 that

695
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:44,170
11 is providing you @ly au @ly or 2 in

696
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,470
the infrastructure mode infrastructure

697
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,809
mode provides you with an emulation of a

698
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:53,410
broadcast domain so you can operate your

699
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:56,499
ipv6 stack exactly quote-unquote as if

700
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,420
it was Ethernet and to emulate the

701
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:59,919
broadcast domain with multiple wireless

702
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,650
nodes which is each of a different

703
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,569
broadcast domain they all agree that the

704
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,569
broadcast domain of reference is that of

705
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:08,710
the access point right meaning that if

706
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:10,119
you want to send a broadcast from a

707
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,999
station what you actually do is say to

708
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,390
the AP AP and the AP would broadcast it

709
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:18,189
so everybody is who can receive this

710
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,019
broadcast must be in the broadcast

711
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,759
domain of the AP or the APS if you have

712
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:26,529
an extended service set what we are

713
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:29,769
doing with this registration and this

714
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:31,440
backbone router is we are pretty much

715
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:34,390
doing the exact same thing at layer 3

716
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,910
now if you wonder why that 11 did the

717
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,190
way they did well think if I mean it

718
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,230
about how a transport proxy operates

719
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,549
you know those loading bridges what they

720
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,749
do is when they don't know what to

721
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:45,609
market right where her MAC address is

722
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:46,660
they will just flood the network with a

723
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:48,700
broadcast

724
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,098
and when when a packet comes back from

725
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,359
that MAC address that they will of you

726
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:55,029
on the bridge and say oh that MAC

727
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:57,609
addresses on this port if you want it to

728
00:38:55,029 --> 00:39:00,099
do the same thing at a your to on Wi-Fi

729
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:02,230
you would end up broadcasting and in you

730
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,579
look out for any MAC address and from

731
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,750
the wireless perspective that's

732
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:06,819
completely unacceptable because

733
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,579
broadcast is actually expensive

734
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:11,799
under-delivered so from the start dot 11

735
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:14,140
designer said hey hey I can't have this

736
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:16,329
reactive operation I will be proactive

737
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,269
so part of what you do with an

738
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:21,819
association process is you actually pre

739
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:23,950
establish a bridging state in the access

740
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,619
point so when there is a lookup a

741
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,939
broadcast the access point already knows

742
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,849
whether the MAC address is attached to

743
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,529
it or not so it will actually cancel the

744
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,910
broadcast though it will not copy it on

745
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:37,269
the wireless if there is nobody

746
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:39,848
interests is nowhere side right so

747
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:41,200
basically you avoid the cost of this

748
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:44,529
lookup and the broadcast that's

749
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,029
associated to it what we do we need five

750
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,589
for five and the backbone router is we

751
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:49,869
do the exact same thing but at layer 3

752
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:53,140
wait five for five becomes the

753
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:56,980
Association and the backbone router is

754
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,750
this transparent bridge but atlas ray so

755
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,299
when there is this broadcast happening

756
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,210
you know and nslookup not the access

757
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:06,190
point to lay off three access point can

758
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,799
recognize whether the IP address is

759
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:11,559
already associated register to it so it

760
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:15,038
can know whether it's useful to just

761
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:17,799
cancel the recap or turn it into unicast

762
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,089
or just reply on behalf with the

763
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:22,809
backbone router you can do all those

764
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:26,109
operations right so we've reached the

765
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:29,769
same state with this this method in ipv6

766
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:35,109
well you you can avoid the cost of the

767
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:38,649
loop gap over the wireless network the

768
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:40,390
address protection draft AP and E is in

769
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,259
that world the equivalent to send to

770
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,299
secure and e

771
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:45,759
secure and E is very complex because

772
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:48,910
you're securing any to any open and

773
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:50,740
let's look at basically which means that

774
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,549
you have to place your crypto between

775
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,258
any peers if you operate in a

776
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:58,690
registration mode you must think again

777
00:40:56,259 --> 00:41:00,759
like an APU NATO station does not sound

778
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,259
a packet to another station in

779
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:04,569
infrastructure mode it sends the packet

780
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,910
to the AP and the AP sends it to the

781
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:08,109
other station because you have to live

782
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:12,250
within the broadcast domain on the

783
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:14,890
access point in at layer 3 when we do

784
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,880
the backbone router and at 5:05 the the

785
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,500
prefixes are advertised as not on link

786
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,579
because you your desired operation is

787
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,259
that Li the same thing you want the

788
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,809
packet to go to the router that is we

789
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:30,059
access point and the router forward the

790
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:35,319
packet back to the destination station

791
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:38,529
right so by protecting the ownership of

792
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:41,200
the address at the router using some

793
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:43,599
crypto mechanism proof of ownership etc

794
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,839
we can provide the equivalent service of

795
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,849
sound without distributing all the send

796
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,099
stack to every devices it's just between

797
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:53,890
the device and the router it's quite

798
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:56,380
easy to do because as your register the

799
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,660
detrás for the first time then you can

800
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,180
give the token instead of a MAC address

801
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,519
now a crypto token and you can use it

802
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,308
for proof of ownership later so if your

803
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:09,430
IP address moves from earliest really to

804
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:12,670
another la 3 AP the AP can challenge you

805
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:15,430
for the ownership of this token which is

806
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,349
stored in the infrastructure and so you

807
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,000
can prove that you're still the guy who

808
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,450
registered this address for the first

809
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,640
time

810
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,649
first-come first-serve so we can

811
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,240
actually deliver the savvy properties we

812
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,890
can do so that res validation I will

813
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,859
only for the packet if it comes from the

814
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:33,279
rightful owner and they will not let an

815
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:34,750
attacker get on the trace that belong

816
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:37,269
somebody else because he cannot prove

817
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:42,299
the ownership so that's pretty much what

818
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:45,459
IA pnd does so with this we were kind of

819
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:50,220
done emulating we are kind of done

820
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:53,859
emulating an aunt of an infrastructure

821
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,859
ESS at layer 3 so now we could start

822
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:59,230
living I would say without all the way

823
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:01,960
up to broadcast emulation that you

824
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,470
haven't infrastructure mode which is

825
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,739
good for new applications like OCB

826
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:11,259
but we still use the normal and the

827
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:13,329
operation on the backbone meaning that

828
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:15,219
even if we protect the wireless we don't

829
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:18,369
take the wire the wire I still the same

830
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:20,319
as it was ever so there is this new

831
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:23,559
draft which we published like six month

832
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,900
ago unique a slow cap and this one

833
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,989
actually extends the methods that we

834
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:32,920
have developed for the wireless side

835
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:38,289
onto the backbone like on Ethernet if

836
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:40,599
you work on overlays and big fabrics

837
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:42,099
you're already used to the fact that if

838
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,079
you want to establish a VX land between

839
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:46,390
an ingress and egress you have to

840
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,299
resolve the egress point for given IP

841
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,739
address right so that there is this

842
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:52,839
notion that there is the central

843
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:55,839
database somewhere IMAP server

844
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,660
map-resolver of sort which knows every

845
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,799
IP address on the network and varieties

846
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,149
because you need you need to establish

847
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:04,269
another later on or between the ingress

848
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:07,059
and egress so it's nothing new for many

849
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:12,008
of us who do this kind of networks but

850
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:15,999
there is no simple abstraction for a

851
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:17,829
wireless phone or a PC to talk to the

852
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,609
map server map-resolver they don't talk

853
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:23,890
less right and so so we are missing this

854
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:26,499
this simple interface that would allow

855
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:29,410
any IP tries to tell the map server I'm

856
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:32,109
here so that when there is a lookup

857
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,420
instead of having to broadcast over all

858
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:36,009
the fabric you can actually just look on

859
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,170
the map server map-resolver to know the

860
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:40,390
MAC address and be done and with this

861
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:43,509
you save all this broadcast that nd is

862
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:45,249
doing on your fabric so that was that

863
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:46,930
was something which just is a simple

864
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,848
extension to what we have in wireless

865
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,969
but it's really not done for wireless

866
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:55,660
it's redone for wire so that's that's

867
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:58,449
one of those reasons why I tend to think

868
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:02,140
that the work which I started as a six

869
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:04,989
low document code maybe should be

870
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,489
actually a six man document right and

871
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:09,670
that's why I'm presenting those things

872
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:12,789
this presentation and the unicast look

873
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,680
at that six band tomorrow so I wanted

874
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:16,660
this section here well this presentation

875
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,089
was to give them the story so now they

876
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:22,058
know where the unique a circuit comes

877
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:24,009
from but for people you know I talked to

878
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:26,469
it's in Cisco it's more like I'm telling

879
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:27,190
them a with a remote I'm after is a

880
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:29,440
stuttered in

881
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,200
face enable discovery to populate the

882
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,369
map server so that you know the devices

883
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:38,589
don't have to talk list because they

884
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:40,980
don't and so this new draft is actually

885
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:43,720
something which is targeted to six man

886
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:47,560
to give them the whole story to show

887
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:50,589
them that you know in a world where the

888
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,900
plane is on that is not the only case

889
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:54,880
where you have a lot of wireless with or

890
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,480
without broadcast emulation at the rear

891
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,140
too while you have data centers overlays

892
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:06,390
etc the methods that we defined in last

893
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:10,480
century for a yellow cable can be

894
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:16,690
slightly obsolete and that we may want

895
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:17,980
to actually refresh Andy and its evolve

896
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,020
or die basically

897
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,460
some people say okay let's just do point

898
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:25,420
to point and be done with it and then

899
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:29,109
jeez becomes almost nothing it's becomes

900
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:32,230
lldp or whatever or you actually refresh

901
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:34,569
it and modernize it so that you can use

902
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:37,180
still use it and build large subnets

903
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:40,839
with it I'm in favor of building large

904
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:43,149
subnets I'm in favor of because we do it

905
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,150
we have subnets of thousands of devices

906
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,829
in the field that we ship right now we

907
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,030
have large conferences we have Smart

908
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:50,740
Grid applications we have ton of

909
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:55,510
applications where a large term that is

910
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,390
useful at the same time we want to avoid

911
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:01,060
the broadcast on those large fabrics

912
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:02,379
which means that we want to rot which

913
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,390
means that we want to take those

914
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,770
processes that you're used to seeing my

915
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:11,348
clear emulation like the infrastructure

916
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:13,829
mode in dot 11 and you want to move that

917
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:16,480
to layer 3 and use that state to rot

918
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:18,670
inside the fabric so for those in this

919
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,710
room who have been doing repo and those

920
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,500
meshes etc it's no surprise that's what

921
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:27,190
we do every day but for people coming

922
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:31,150
from a more traditional world of 6-man

923
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:33,339
it's more of a shock because some people

924
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,920
never wanted to hear about multi-link

925
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:37,270
subnet there is this desire that the

926
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,010
subnet is a link and the link is a

927
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,190
subnet some people don't even realize or

928
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,630
one is physical the other one is logical

929
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,039
and actually you could map the logical

930
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,289
thing and bigger than an Inca and

931
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,180
smaller than the link for people because

932
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:51,539
of Ethernet they see that as pretty much

933
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,490
the same thing anyway it's not and

934
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:56,480
actually this presentation after that is

935
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:59,279
all about different subnet models and

936
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,289
apply to wireless what is my link model

937
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,700
and what is my subject model because

938
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:07,559
it's not obvious it's not even that so

939
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,049
that was a long introduction but you

940
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,910
told me at yet time to more I want so I

941
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:13,288
hope that well I'm happy that you're

942
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,390
here because tomorrow I won't be able to

943
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:18,000
say all those world

944
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:20,279
so basically nd the way it was designed

945
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,589
was for point-to-point and transit link

946
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,230
it's written in big letter in the draft

947
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:27,509
and that's that's because it uses

948
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:29,430
broadcast use it layer to broadcast we

949
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,770
people tell me oh it's you know it's

950
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:33,538
multicast and say what joke is that

951
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,369
because there is no such a thing at

952
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:38,069
Lesley automatic as well there is nobody

953
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:39,780
deployed it and anyway it's not my aunt

954
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:41,369
the one that I Triple E has produced is

955
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,190
not meant to scale to to add the power

956
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:47,880
of 24 bits alright so there is no such

957
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:51,270
thing as a layer of two sorries did not

958
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,520
multicast don't dream so when we you

959
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,619
know with our good face send packets to

960
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,660
two's multicast group the first thing

961
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:59,490
that the the eye area does is place the

962
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,140
first bit of the MAC address to one and

963
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:04,200
the thing gets broadcasted through the

964
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,420
fabric you there is no layer two magic

965
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,339
to solve the problem that we did not

966
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,289
solve we just pushed it about over the

967
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:12,020
fence hoping that they are Tripoli would

968
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:20,549
solve this for us never happened

969
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:23,849
right so I Wi-Fi does a emulation of a

970
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:26,730
transit link and that's why ipv6 of our

971
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:29,190
Ethernet can be translated into IP six

972
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,829
over Wi-Fi but it has impacts because

973
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:35,609
radios are not wires in particular

974
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:37,289
multicast on the radio there are number

975
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,759
of things which are kind of interesting

976
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:40,799
which happen when you send a multicast

977
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,510
versus a unicast when you send a

978
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:45,029
multicast you have to send it at the

979
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:47,369
slowest speed possible because you want

980
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:50,700
to reach everybody who is associated to

981
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:53,579
you ok it it means that some packets can

982
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,020
takes 100 times the airspace of a

983
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:58,380
unicast packet that could be set

984
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,660
much faster second thing is when you do

985
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:03,140
broadcast you cannot be informed right

986
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:06,390
you have to send it multi-directional

987
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:08,759
omnidirectional was when you do unicast

988
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:14,129
you can be in form and then multiplex no

989
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:18,510
MIMO multiple of multiple packets so

990
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:20,640
when I hear that doing p2p doing

991
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:23,190
broadcast over IP to piece is like doing

992
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,319
a unicast or not a unicast it's wrong

993
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,820
because the fire won't do the same thing

994
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,740
if you tell him it's a broadcast and if

995
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,320
you tell unicast even if you aim at a

996
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,390
single person and you have a logical p2p

997
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,710
connection with that person if you don't

998
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:39,750
tell the fie that it is a unicast if it

999
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:41,640
does the broadcast bit it will tune the

1000
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,550
radio differently it will be slower it

1001
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:47,160
will be omnidirectional okay so it's

1002
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:54,300
important to to turn any package again

1003
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:56,819
into a unicast okay so usually so far

1004
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,130
we've done madly after emulation to make

1005
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:01,350
belief that you you can do Ethernet and

1006
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:04,410
really I started this draft when when I

1007
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:07,529
really started reviewing the ipv6 of our

1008
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:10,230
CB o CV is this mode of not 11 that's

1009
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:13,500
designed for cars where you don't have

1010
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:16,200
the infrastructure mode you don't have

1011
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:20,820
VSS and VSS you're naked you're just

1012
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:23,220
like on 15 for ipv6 of out of 5 meaning

1013
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,400
that the broadcast domain are those of

1014
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:28,589
the sender not those of the access point

1015
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,140
meaning that all of the assumptions that

1016
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:34,230
we made that there is a single broadcast

1017
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,450
domain so we can do ipv6 and D the way

1018
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:38,790
it stands all this is broken doesn't

1019
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:40,350
work right so that's all these long

1020
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,810
discussions for those who follow the IP

1021
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:48,270
wave but that was my knee-jerk reaction

1022
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:52,020
to the initial IP wave documents even if

1023
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:55,140
there is a mac layer emulation of the

1024
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:58,650
transit domain of a fully full broadcast

1025
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,319
domain everybody is in it hurts it hurts

1026
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:03,390
because the broadcast is slow it hurts

1027
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,370
because when there are so many broadcast

1028
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,839
your batteries is rapidly depleted I

1029
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,230
don't know if you found it but I found

1030
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,450
that my phone

1031
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:12,850
depleted twice as fast at the ietf them

1032
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:14,680
at home its processing all this

1033
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,330
broadcast its processing so many

1034
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,220
broadcasts that the phones usually have

1035
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:20,740
protective methods by which to filter a

1036
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:22,299
number of them if the filter a number of

1037
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,089
them and one of them is important well

1038
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:28,180
it's not retried like if I do this dad

1039
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:29,590
over my my fabric there is a good chance

1040
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,210
that the number of the phones will just

1041
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:34,150
filter it out because they keep one out

1042
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:36,130
of five or something like that well the

1043
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:38,800
end result if my dad operation will fail

1044
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:42,070
so how come a music seems to work

1045
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,800
because the duplication don't happen

1046
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:47,500
right you have to force a duplication in

1047
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,240
v6 to resume on if you like if you leave

1048
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,770
it to make a try so I'll run down you

1049
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,779
know all the heiress's we are from six

1050
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:55,930
months the chances of a duplication of

1051
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,270
so low that the the user perspective of

1052
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,368
the service is always working but in

1053
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:03,070
fact the cooperation is below behind it

1054
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:05,609
that doesn't work we tried it at the IDF

1055
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:08,530
we found that on a big meeting like this

1056
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:10,119
one that out of five discovers the

1057
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:13,660
duplication it's like it's completely

1058
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:15,100
useless it works because the prime does

1059
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:19,750
not occur not because we know how to

1060
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:21,520
solve it right so having the

1061
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,100
infrastructure know the addresses of

1062
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,490
everybody in a registrar mapserver now

1063
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:29,319
we can redo the dad and we don't have to

1064
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,399
have the radios always on to defend

1065
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,910
himself because we have an

1066
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,340
infrastructure service for doing it ok

1067
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,350
and there are number of other mismatches

1068
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:42,190
actually how you tell me when them take

1069
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:43,779
too much time right but I think this is

1070
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,490
so interesting right I want to share

1071
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,140
with you I want to make sure that that's

1072
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:48,339
your in you know on the right page and

1073
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,140
all those things because it doesn't

1074
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,460
doesn't meet the eye I mean it's

1075
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,379
something that you have to think quite

1076
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,510
through before you read get your mind on

1077
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,400
it so remember further mismatches with

1078
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:59,800
traditional Andy the first one is that

1079
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,220
you have an office roaming first roaming

1080
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,260
expect that you can just get there and

1081
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,209
and the infrastructure will always know

1082
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,680
where you are at leav 3 that's probably

1083
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,660
true right because your reassociate

1084
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,980
rapidly better they are too but that

1085
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,170
they are three when you have this you

1086
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,760
snoop the protocols and try to figure

1087
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,560
out well the latest location of a

1088
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:22,180
particular devices and we are doing that

1089
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:24,880
today this network if the guy moves

1090
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,129
rapidly with that 11 now the message is

1091
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,810
that we sound about the fabric to say

1092
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,300
I've seen him here I've seen him here

1093
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,009
might arrive in disorder meaning that

1094
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,020
the really infrastructure I think is

1095
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,940
here and actually is there now if you

1096
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,500
use that for verax land and you lose all

1097
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,560
your packets because tunnels are not

1098
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:44,770
rotted to right place so you better not

1099
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:47,770
run too fast at the first message second

1100
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:49,360
one is intermittent connectivity if you

1101
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,950
want to save your battery you don't

1102
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,960
receive all packets all the time so I

1103
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:55,089
can you do that how can you defend

1104
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,260
yourself because you're not even armed

1105
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:00,460
to say eh that's my address

1106
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,530
another news case which came up a lot

1107
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,710
more recently is the case that that 11

1108
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:08,140
calls feels so it's the the so called

1109
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:11,620
Tokyo Station case all the guys come out

1110
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,150
from the train at the same time and they

1111
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,370
want to have instant connectivity

1112
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,260
hundreds of people so for that day I

1113
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:19,150
Triple E has been working very hard to

1114
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:22,120
make the association process very quick

1115
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:24,820
and massively scalable but guess what

1116
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:28,319
to get the ipv6 traffic through it takes

1117
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,820
one to ten seconds and there is actually

1118
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,410
draft at 6:00 mine by Janine cava which

1119
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,290
just describes this particular

1120
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,790
phenomenon even if you do optimistic

1121
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:40,120
that which saves you one second you

1122
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:41,500
still may take up to 10 15 seconds to

1123
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,390
get your first packets through and there

1124
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:46,720
are a number of reasons for that and one

1125
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:49,660
of them is the reactive nature of Andy

1126
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,850
because when the router will see your

1127
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,560
dress for the first time instead of

1128
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:55,390
being able to fold the packet has to

1129
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,220
resolve the MAC address so you're in the

1130
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,779
stock your station you just joined you

1131
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,459
send a few packets to the Google's of

1132
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,040
the world to see what kind of

1133
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,630
connectivity you are you have and and

1134
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,730
the server somewhere and the infra

1135
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:08,440
starts responding to you the router the

1136
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,930
first time it sees one of those packets

1137
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,090
it will punt it to software the software

1138
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:15,370
will send an NG message waits and the

1139
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,080
nurse wait for another during that time

1140
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,790
if more packets arrive the packets will

1141
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,779
be dropped because the rotor wants to

1142
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:24,820
protect itself right and after the DNA

1143
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,950
comes back maybe one packet will be sent

1144
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,350
to the station which will say hey I have

1145
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,970
a very little mini mated connectivity on

1146
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:34,060
that network let me retry in five

1147
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,450
seconds so you can put all the faults

1148
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:39,440
you want a day or two

1149
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:41,990
the layer-3 did not proactively set the

1150
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,370
ante cache on the router before the

1151
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:45,799
first packet comes from the

1152
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:48,140
infrastructure as a response you're

1153
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,060
screwed right you can say 40

1154
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:52,810
milliseconds or 100 milliseconds at the

1155
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:56,390
Mecca yarn you lose 10 seconds at 303

1156
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:59,810
that's kind of sad right so that that's

1157
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,430
another miss from ng because n D was

1158
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,140
designed at the time we are doing some

1159
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,600
software operation on the fly of the

1160
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,790
received packet was okay right now we do

1161
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,370
everything in silicon and we certainly

1162
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,540
punching a packet to the software to do

1163
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:15,410
an and the resolution is something

1164
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:17,840
completely absurd we're in a world where

1165
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:20,569
the routing protocols always apart from

1166
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,480
money pre-populate the silicon the fear

1167
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:28,070
before we even need it but on the last

1168
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,170
hub because of nd right what we really

1169
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,940
want is to be able to pre-populate nd

1170
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:34,550
cash before it's even needed so we don't

1171
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:36,230
lose those 10 seconds + and we don't

1172
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:43,280
have all those attack vectors that we

1173
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:44,900
can have with nd and is it oh yeah so

1174
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,010
now to get there we need to think a

1175
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,890
little bit the first thing we have to

1176
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:52,130
think of is what's my link model what

1177
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:54,740
you have at the file level is this

1178
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:56,180
broadcast domain right so you've got you

1179
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,819
get mr. high which has a broadcast

1180
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,140
domain and I can broadcast on this and

1181
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,230
you've got mr. B which has this

1182
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:05,450
broadcast domain is that my IP link well

1183
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:08,240
some people say it's my opinon it's my

1184
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:09,500
broadcast domain so quote-unquote I can

1185
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,089
talk to whoever is mine but in my

1186
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,760
broadcast domain because I expect that

1187
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:17,030
to be reflexive which is true or not

1188
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,890
true it can be true if there is no no

1189
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,330
interviewer and we have the the same

1190
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:22,670
antennas and we have the same power

1191
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,770
levels etc in our Wi-Fi infrastructure

1192
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:26,630
we find that there is a ratio 1 to 10

1193
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:29,840
between the quality of the signal in

1194
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:31,640
both directions right even if if even if

1195
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,320
the station adapts the power to that of

1196
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,850
the IP which is supposed to do the AP

1197
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,590
suppose say hey I'm sending to you at

1198
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:38,330
this power the station is supposed to

1199
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,890
use the same power back but actually the

1200
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:42,140
antennas are not the same nothing is the

1201
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,660
same and even the quality of the the

1202
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,220
chain is not the same so at the end of

1203
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,839
the day you don't get the same signal

1204
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,250
it's not really bi-directional it's not

1205
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:53,890
reflexive but it's mostly

1206
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:57,710
reflexive what is not is transitive so

1207
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:59,839
basically you can be out this link when

1208
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:02,090
two people are in each other's broadcast

1209
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:04,310
domain so is that what you call the link

1210
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:06,740
I tend to think that's what I want to

1211
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:10,370
call a leak why because I want to form a

1212
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:13,970
link local address yeah and there is no

1213
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:16,580
point no way to do dad once and for all

1214
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:20,240
on on the radio interface which is

1215
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:23,060
always on say my my a CB radio in my car

1216
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,859
always on can I do that for an IP

1217
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:28,130
address in the morning and drive through

1218
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,720
the world I mean obviously that there's

1219
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,190
nothing because who was in the ranch

1220
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,109
when I did it at 8:00 in the morning at

1221
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:34,490
home and then I drive through town if

1222
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,990
there is duplication I could not detect

1223
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:38,479
it from home what's the point

1224
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,850
and I never turn down my interface I

1225
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,740
never detected anything how when should

1226
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:44,990
i redo that on the other hand if you

1227
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,359
consider that your link is when you can

1228
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:49,819
actually talk discover mr. B and talk to

1229
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,740
him and that the you can uniqueness of

1230
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:54,470
your link local has to be asserted only

1231
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:56,359
between those two and that's true right

1232
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:58,009
right if if he does not know anybody in

1233
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,350
called Pascal and I don't know anybody

1234
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:02,000
called Robert I can call him Robert and

1235
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:04,640
I don't make a mistake and you can call

1236
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,580
me Pascal that's enough as long as I

1237
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,310
have a single Robert I around me I can

1238
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:12,190
talk to Robert without any any problem

1239
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:15,350
with a latent duplication and

1240
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:16,730
misunderstanding so the way we do it in

1241
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:19,790
in five four five is exactly like that

1242
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:22,640
we say you don't have to assert the

1243
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:24,290
uniqueness of your IP address once and

1244
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,170
for all that doesn't work you have to do

1245
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:30,410
it individually with every people you

1246
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:33,830
talk to so the link layer a little low

1247
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:36,109
contrast is not actually looked up on

1248
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:38,509
this central registrar that you are for

1249
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:41,840
uniqueness it's just between you and

1250
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:45,230
your first hop router never goes

1251
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,780
anywhere else and you don't swat them

1252
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,670
but if you do a write over of mesh you

1253
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:52,190
don't wrap to link locals right because

1254
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:54,620
it's what hub so we really see the link

1255
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:57,170
as being this point-to-point thing that

1256
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,210
actually the we build a p2p subnet if we

1257
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,780
like and that's that's the me more thing

1258
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,780
that we can do

1259
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,808
then we need to so this is kind of a

1260
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:10,200
physical which ability thing right so

1261
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:12,869
link if you look at a to two hundred it

1262
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,819
kinds of words what is 9p link as if

1263
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:17,160
it's a medium right a physical thing

1264
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:21,630
here we already alpha way to the logical

1265
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:25,170
thing it's even reading 802 Android it's

1266
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:26,670
not very clear what should the concept

1267
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:29,430
of a link be should it be my broadcast

1268
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,829
domain or should it be this peer-to-peer

1269
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,089
point-to-point connection but then

1270
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:35,190
because I've done and things like that

1271
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:37,259
it makes a lot of more sense to consider

1272
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:40,260
it's the point-to-point connection now

1273
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,240
should I live with only point two point

1274
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,890
seven nights like some people want to do

1275
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,379
well I should be on the smart grid

1276
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:48,569
network with thousands of nodes I think

1277
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,799
to deploy thousands of prefixes for just

1278
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:54,000
two sensors talking to one another

1279
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:56,520
unreal a that's seems a bit absurd you

1280
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,319
could do it you have ample room in v6 if

1281
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,390
you want to deploy it this way now the

1282
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:02,308
users don't want to deploy it this way

1283
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:05,038
they want to change they just expand is

1284
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:06,660
this prefix and then you write inside it

1285
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,150
using ripple that's how we deploy those

1286
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:11,940
things so it's still useful to build

1287
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:13,289
more complex network so the for the

1288
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,740
first case that we can think of is

1289
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:19,260
haven't spoke this is the case of an MS

1290
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:22,169
your roadside unit and you have two cars

1291
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,789
which are next to this roadside unit and

1292
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:26,789
the roadside unit can actually provide

1293
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:28,500
connectivity to the world so what you

1294
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:30,900
see in this model is that the roadside

1295
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,210
unit broadcast domain is exactly like

1296
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:36,630
that as an API right you can say oh I

1297
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:40,230
can broadcast to whether my hub can talk

1298
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:42,210
to and then I'll get the equivalent of a

1299
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:46,200
broadcast and and and make a subnet of

1300
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:47,520
it if you if you say not on link you get

1301
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,288
the exact same service after you're

1302
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,910
through the nightly or to you gold every

1303
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:53,819
times through the hub and then you go to

1304
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:56,940
your destination so the simple action of

1305
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:59,308
saying not on link gives you that now

1306
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,710
what's more interesting is the prefixes

1307
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:03,510
right you can be on the same prefix as

1308
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:05,010
this guy because you never talk directly

1309
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:06,599
to him you don't need to be in his

1310
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:09,450
broadcast domain because you don't do

1311
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:11,250
that you don't do Luka you don't do that

1312
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:13,379
because eight five four five registers

1313
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,480
your heart rise to the hobby and the hub

1314
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,170
is responsible for telling this address

1315
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,650
is duplicate

1316
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:21,690
not so there is no dad you just register

1317
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,980
on the registration succeeds Johan the

1318
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,450
registration fails because there's

1319
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,910
duplicate you form a new tries to try

1320
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,799
again but you'll never have to do that

1321
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:31,618
again

1322
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:33,180
he's in charge for a lifetime enough

1323
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,589
I'll look up you don't look at you talk

1324
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,180
to your writer and it will clear because

1325
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:38,670
he has a registration on the other side

1326
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:40,859
he will know how to fold so you see how

1327
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:43,349
it's five four five actually solved the

1328
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:46,650
prime when you have urban spoken

1329
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:48,869
activity at layer two so like I said you

1330
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:50,700
know CB you don't have broadcast

1331
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:53,220
emulation at Mac layer you have to do

1332
01:03:50,700 --> 01:04:01,859
the same service but at layer 3 and

1333
01:03:53,220 --> 01:04:07,200
that's exactly what I'd fight for 5k so

1334
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:09,029
let me see I won't cover this so the

1335
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,129
last model that we see a lot and that's

1336
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:14,280
how we build our mesh of smart grid

1337
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:18,089
things is this mesh here so we still be

1338
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:20,069
on this point-to-point connection and

1339
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:22,500
then we're at between them and we use

1340
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:24,480
repo so in this case here all you need

1341
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,010
is is just one hopeful warning so you

1342
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,799
don't need routing you need routing as

1343
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:30,450
soon as you've got to hop forward right

1344
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,670
and that's that's when we actually play

1345
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,140
play repo and without five four five

1346
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,390
what you do then is you need a software

1347
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,950
register we call a 6 lb R which comes

1348
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:40,049
from our c 6725

1349
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:41,279
and now you get uniqueness of your

1350
01:04:40,049 --> 01:04:42,809
drives when you've got uniqueness of

1351
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,900
your address you can inject it in the

1352
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:50,180
writing fabric and get to any place the

1353
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:53,760
bottom line is you never broadcast right

1354
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:58,259
at least at any level now there is there

1355
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,690
is a last situation well actually your

1356
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,190
multi nning subnet is it erogenous

1357
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:05,549
meaning that you have a different

1358
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:08,849
quality of network in the backbone and

1359
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:10,530
in the wireless access so in this case

1360
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:13,559
is just mapping again a Wi-Fi network

1361
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:15,809
but this could be your phone mesh so in

1362
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:19,710
a Wi-Fi network you have urban spoke the

1363
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:22,380
API or EAP and all the stations all the

1364
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:25,140
hosts and and you have this backbone and

1365
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,549
the backbone router here is doing proxy

1366
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,618
neighbor discovery so when there is a

1367
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:30,288
look up the backbone router having a

1368
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,239
state for spoke a

1369
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:36,380
say yes it's your term the broadcasting

1370
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:38,869
to unicast so we can respond so just one

1371
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:40,549
of those things you can do right if he's

1372
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,140
sleeping and and basically the backbone

1373
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:45,288
water could reply on behalf of his

1374
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:47,709
living proxy if there is like a dad so

1375
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:50,029
you can do all those sorts of operation

1376
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:53,419
the killer the key thing is on the

1377
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,979
backbone it's T of the good ol nd so you

1378
01:05:53,419 --> 01:05:58,969
do broadcast or everything it's just not

1379
01:05:54,979 --> 01:06:09,198
propagated in the wireless yeah that's

1380
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:11,419
when I was switched well from this group

1381
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,189
is just more like trying to get a sense

1382
01:06:11,419 --> 01:06:16,969
that we are done with what we could do

1383
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:19,129
but now we go to a maintenance mode if

1384
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:21,229
we go to maintenance mode then it's

1385
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:23,329
probably six-man and this question to

1386
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:24,589
the group question to the IDE but it

1387
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:25,969
seems to me that that has kind of

1388
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:27,890
illogical transfer when the technology

1389
01:06:25,969 --> 01:06:29,390
has been done in a group that you know

1390
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,429
the maintenance is not as redundant a

1391
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:34,578
group but it's six men unless six law

1392
01:06:31,429 --> 01:06:36,769
wants to keep the maintenance of it the

1393
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:40,429
implication on already published are to

1394
01:06:36,769 --> 01:06:43,218
be published drafts that we have in six

1395
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:44,900
lo well we turned America see here write

1396
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:48,319
these things we turned America see here

1397
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:50,059
but then do we do we want to give you

1398
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,529
know because what could happen to this

1399
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:52,669
is get generalize to more interface

1400
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:54,829
that's a discussion which has happened

1401
01:06:52,669 --> 01:06:56,929
on six men do we generalize that or more

1402
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:58,969
interfaces it makes a lot of sense to do

1403
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:01,459
that but then it would not be six level

1404
01:06:58,969 --> 01:07:03,259
so why don't we say a it goes to six man

1405
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:05,959
they maintain it and they generalize it

1406
01:07:03,259 --> 01:07:06,459
to more interfaces that's one thing on

1407
01:07:05,959 --> 01:07:09,618
the table

1408
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:11,689
yeah suresh krisshnan so not speaking as

1409
01:07:09,619 --> 01:07:13,279
a tea here but it's like someone who's

1410
01:07:11,689 --> 01:07:15,019
interested in this topic so this bunch

1411
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,959
of us who did like similar kind of work

1412
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:21,738
in six men before so eric normal Samhita

1413
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:23,569
who's sitting right behind here so what

1414
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:25,279
are the things that has like not been

1415
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:27,169
addressed like very well and it's very

1416
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:28,579
hard to address properly is the backward

1417
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:31,279
compatibility with the stuff that's

1418
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:33,799
there currently okay so if you have a

1419
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:39,799
network where there's like there's a lot

1420
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:42,799
of texting by something for so like

1421
01:07:39,799 --> 01:07:44,210
everybody uses this as the default nd is

1422
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:47,210
like a lot of work

1423
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:48,410
so I I'm not you could think no right

1424
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:51,099
like you know that's kind of what we

1425
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:53,328
thought too so like I select authors and

1426
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:56,510
it just takes a lot of time so I

1427
01:07:53,329 --> 01:07:59,390
wouldn't assume that this will happen

1428
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:00,890
soon so it could happen right like but I

1429
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:03,500
think it's gonna take its time so like I

1430
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:04,279
think we'll have the conversation like

1431
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,960
you know how it's going to get

1432
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,059
maintained but like six low specs have

1433
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,550
to be maintained here 2x6 low at least

1434
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:13,400
until like six low exists right like and

1435
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:15,950
I think is pretty far out before we can

1436
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,980
think of like closing six loss so I

1437
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:21,108
think let's do things one at a time I

1438
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:24,678
think you have a good starting document

1439
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:26,900
for the discussions and in this room

1440
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:28,250
you're gonna get that the constraint or

1441
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:30,259
like you know the six low kind of

1442
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:32,029
perspective and then you're gonna see

1443
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:33,859
the perspective from people who are

1444
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:36,440
doing something completely different

1445
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:38,390
like you know this like the dhcpv6

1446
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:40,009
discussion right like you know you had

1447
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:42,230
this discussion right like four people

1448
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:45,350
say oh I want to run dhcpv6 like a

1449
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:47,330
random IAD Lance right and so those kind

1450
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,920
of discussions will happen in six-man

1451
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,479
because like people have different views

1452
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,920
and that's really the goal of six-man

1453
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,488
right it should bring all this

1454
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,699
perspectives together so here you if you

1455
01:08:55,488 --> 01:09:00,009
go into any of this like like I would

1456
01:08:58,698 --> 01:09:02,448
call it like constrain node cluster

1457
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:04,759
working groups like you know you'll find

1458
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:05,960
mostly support here right but like if

1459
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:07,779
you go to the wider community

1460
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,399
there's people are like different

1461
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:12,949
operational models and and different

1462
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,899
kind of constraints who might have other

1463
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:16,370
things to bring up and any I'm not

1464
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:18,410
saying it's possible or not to do I'm

1465
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:20,210
just saying it's like don't think it's

1466
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:21,559
gonna be a short-term thing like this is

1467
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:24,140
gonna get done that's what I'm running

1468
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:26,569
it you know yeah we were there Samhita

1469
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,400
rate myself we want the official 10 TF

1470
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:31,100
rotten yes I do exactly what we went

1471
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:38,809
through I was there so I see what you're

1472
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:41,420
saying you know so yes it I don't want

1473
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:43,880
to repeat but I agree with Sudesh that

1474
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:47,270
you would have easier time in this

1475
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:49,069
working group than others right but if

1476
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:51,410
we want to extend it to other links then

1477
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:54,259
we have to take it to six Mondays no so

1478
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:56,840
it's just matter so this interesting

1479
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:57,949
discussion because initially it's for

1480
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,659
like maintaining the

1481
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:02,598
ultras and it makes a lot of sense to

1482
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:04,879
continue here but when you have to put

1483
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:07,429
them to different things or when you

1484
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,920
have to do new functions like this one

1485
01:10:07,429 --> 01:10:11,599
in particular that's when it becomes a

1486
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,300
lot less clear so that's why it's

1487
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:17,329
interesting to see you know how every

1488
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:20,659
logic logic applies to whom so unique

1489
01:10:17,329 --> 01:10:22,190
eyes look up is is just new right it's

1490
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:24,348
just a personal submission at this

1491
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:28,098
moment was new at last a chair so it's

1492
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:30,409
like three four months old what's it

1493
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:32,090
about it's about scaling even your

1494
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:36,018
backbone infrastructure it's about

1495
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:38,749
enabling overlay structures like the

1496
01:10:36,019 --> 01:10:42,949
exelon or in vo3 whatever you play as an

1497
01:10:38,749 --> 01:10:44,209
overlay I've been to all the little

1498
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:46,789
train myself because they don't have

1499
01:10:44,209 --> 01:10:49,309
enough pieces to try that that there are

1500
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:52,309
limitations to what you can do with just

1501
01:10:49,309 --> 01:10:53,840
nd on the backbone even wired and that's

1502
01:10:52,309 --> 01:10:56,929
due to the broadcast storm that nd

1503
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,670
Wilcox because each time you have mostly

1504
01:10:56,929 --> 01:11:00,499
if those devices are wireless so they

1505
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:02,659
come they go they join a different ap

1506
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:04,309
you've done them to sleep you start them

1507
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:07,009
over they will they will form a new

1508
01:11:04,309 --> 01:11:09,800
address all this creates a background

1509
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:11,269
pressure of broadcast on your Wi-Fi so

1510
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,039
that's one thing but it also creates

1511
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:15,559
that that pressure on the infrastructure

1512
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,570
itself meaning that you have to refresh

1513
01:11:15,559 --> 01:11:19,130
in the mapping servers and all those

1514
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:20,929
things you have to snap the back yet

1515
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:23,599
and sometimes we do it try it sometime

1516
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:25,820
we fail bottom line is all those

1517
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:27,559
broadcast hurt mostly if you start

1518
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:29,119
distributing your layer to fabric

1519
01:11:27,559 --> 01:11:31,219
overlay or three like you have multiple

1520
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:33,679
sites with the same layer to the main

1521
01:11:31,219 --> 01:11:35,420
that hurts when you have all those

1522
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,550
broadcasts right at the began you build

1523
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,409
this thing that the DES Moine hurts so

1524
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:42,110
broadcasts was okay on a single yellow

1525
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:47,119
wire it's much much less okay on the

1526
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:48,860
multi-site layer to the main so scaling

1527
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,449
a network like this to tens of thousands

1528
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:52,190
of node is something that we want to

1529
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:54,469
build it's not something that works

1530
01:11:52,190 --> 01:12:02,110
easily with ng just off because of this

1531
01:11:54,469 --> 01:12:05,580
reactive broadcast operation and I guess

1532
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:08,619
modern topologies in they want is this

1533
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:10,690
this resolver to be able to just build

1534
01:12:08,619 --> 01:12:13,000
the overlay in the first place the way

1535
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:16,150
we do that today is we snoop the

1536
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,070
protocols so we actually we have to

1537
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:20,469
program the chica intercept the packets

1538
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:23,199
in outerwear and de packets recognize

1539
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:25,090
them push them to software we call that

1540
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,949
pants so we bound to software now we

1541
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,869
analyze the packet we do something like

1542
01:12:26,949 --> 01:12:31,540
a reverse engineering of the protocol

1543
01:12:28,869 --> 01:12:33,219
try to figure out who is where based on

1544
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:35,409
slipping those packets so we Snooper and

1545
01:12:33,219 --> 01:12:37,330
EU is not DHCP who is not actually data

1546
01:12:35,409 --> 01:12:40,449
packets if the source is not known to us

1547
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:42,639
so we can actually trigger like and deep

1548
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:45,129
I guess to see was there so we do all

1549
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:47,860
the sorts of games because we don't know

1550
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:49,810
who's where and we need to know who's

1551
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:52,869
where to be able to to enable our

1552
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:56,080
overlay it's high time that there's a

1553
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:58,269
protocol that tells us precisely where

1554
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,780
every IP addresses so we can have an

1555
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:02,889
overlay that works for all our customers

1556
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,360
that's what we want to be honest we want

1557
01:13:02,889 --> 01:13:05,969
to build a good overlay service and it

1558
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:09,639
could spend over multiple domains

1559
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:12,369
multiple overlay or three right you span

1560
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:14,619
over your cloud or different places for

1561
01:13:12,369 --> 01:13:16,630
that we need a registration protocol and

1562
01:13:14,619 --> 01:13:20,920
we need it on Ethernet we don't need it

1563
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:22,510
only on on wireless devices not only do

1564
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,210
we need a registration but we need to

1565
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:27,520
centralize all this information so we

1566
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:29,290
can do look up because what kills us

1567
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,659
today is all those lookups which are

1568
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:33,369
broadcast about the whole fabric so if

1569
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:36,190
you could have if you can have a central

1570
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:38,980
registrar but we do have but that can be

1571
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:42,610
queried by any host through a started

1572
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:44,678
interface then it's a lot better a host

1573
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,759
today will not totally as our map server

1574
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:47,920
talks Lisp

1575
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,170
right so unless we implement list in

1576
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,820
every host then we have this map server

1577
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:56,230
but you don't know so you will do the

1578
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:58,299
broadcast so why don't we just extend

1579
01:13:56,230 --> 01:14:00,730
and do a little bit so that using a

1580
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,500
simple nslookup instead of doing it

1581
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:04,089
broadcast with which unicast to the map

1582
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,790
server for that you need to locate the

1583
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:09,040
map server big deal and then you just

1584
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:10,510
ask him if there was a registration for

1585
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,880
that address he will tell you if there

1586
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:15,550
was none in a mixed environment you will

1587
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,980
still need to do Ana's look up

1588
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:20,440
but at least you tried and you see the

1589
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:23,589
sort of game you get is the more devices

1590
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,178
play by the new rule the less broadcast

1591
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:28,630
that will be for everybody it's a game

1592
01:14:25,179 --> 01:14:32,110
theory thing the more players the more

1593
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:34,059
we win right because the more lookups

1594
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:36,400
will be answered unicast and there will

1595
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:38,559
be less broadcast for everybody so by

1596
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,659
playing the game of registration you

1597
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:45,699
actually help everybody else not really

1598
01:14:40,659 --> 01:14:47,949
yourself good so that's what the diss

1599
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:49,799
unicast thing is all about so you can do

1600
01:14:47,949 --> 01:14:51,909
an NS directly to him but if you're

1601
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,710
behind the wireless interface for

1602
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:55,780
instance and you already do dns to your

1603
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,260
router then the router will do it on

1604
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:00,309
your behalf

1605
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:01,780
that's the model of 6775 and H 505 you

1606
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:03,760
register to your router and the router

1607
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:06,369
goes to this onto our registrar which is

1608
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,170
the 6lb R so the bottom line is what we

1609
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:11,290
are doing is we are placing a 6 lb on

1610
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,820
the backbone up to now the 6 lvl was

1611
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:16,719
somewhere here usually co-located with

1612
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:18,460
the backbone router now we say eh why

1613
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,219
don't we share this thing for everybody

1614
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:23,349
including the way out guys

1615
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:25,960
so for us in mostly about displacing a

1616
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:27,969
function but also adding this little API

1617
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,369
to do look up because fall night was

1618
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:34,659
mostly used for dad now we do address

1619
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:37,119
resolution and you see the goal is to

1620
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:40,030
take a 6 low fabric this is 6 of ER and

1621
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:42,670
give it to six men so now the question I

1622
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:43,929
asked to Suresh you know earlier becomes

1623
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:47,739
relevant again because the case has

1624
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:50,260
changed so this is 6 low methods but

1625
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:56,230
apply to real 6 man case so where should

1626
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:59,530
it happen now I have my answer so this

1627
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:01,808
is this is now for without this this can

1628
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:03,579
interest this is the first use case

1629
01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:06,639
again the Tokyo Station game that I

1630
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:09,790
talked about earlier this is how things

1631
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:11,710
should work if you do it this way then

1632
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:14,500
you can infer it your traffic almost

1633
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:16,690
instantly instantly enabled as you go in

1634
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,099
the station so basically what the

1635
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,919
wireless guy does when he accesses

1636
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:23,020
network is is DNA tries to real to to

1637
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,550
locate a router and tries to first

1638
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:26,800
unique as to his own router well that

1639
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:28,629
won't work so it will send a multicast

1640
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,059
to all routers

1641
01:16:28,629 --> 01:16:33,489
and the cool thing is it is a multicast

1642
01:16:31,059 --> 01:16:36,369
but remember at leav - its first a

1643
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:38,320
unique as to the AP right and because we

1644
01:16:36,369 --> 01:16:42,518
have a layer 3 AP it will actually go

1645
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:44,889
all the way to layer 3 and what the AP

1646
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:47,559
will say oh no no don't broadcast it I

1647
01:16:44,889 --> 01:16:49,239
can handle so it will never be

1648
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:51,789
broadcasted on the under layer - it will

1649
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:55,239
be absorbed by the lioska AP which will

1650
01:16:51,789 --> 01:16:56,858
actually answer by a unicast arrive so

1651
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:58,358
in this phase here you don't have a

1652
01:16:56,859 --> 01:16:59,889
broadcast that's the first thing you

1653
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:02,889
need to realize there is no matter your

1654
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:05,139
broadcast on a wireless then there is

1655
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:08,289
this NSE arrow which is the registration

1656
01:17:05,139 --> 01:17:10,899
itself arrow is the address registration

1657
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:13,478
option and that's when the 6 backbone

1658
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:15,459
router here will form the nd cache

1659
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:18,099
before there is any packet for it

1660
01:17:15,459 --> 01:17:20,829
so now the MAC address of the station

1661
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:25,530
here is known if you're lucky with the

1662
01:17:20,829 --> 01:17:28,389
new draft you actually you get your

1663
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:29,559
registration to the 6 MBA which tells

1664
01:17:28,389 --> 01:17:32,260
you oh it's unique

1665
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:34,329
ok you've passed that at this point that

1666
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:37,689
is done but if you're in a mixed

1667
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:39,969
environment where there are some notes

1668
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:42,249
which register to the 6 lb on some which

1669
01:17:39,969 --> 01:17:44,489
did not which is your question area you

1670
01:17:42,249 --> 01:17:47,800
still have to run that so this would

1671
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:48,999
this will mostly respond in an

1672
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,659
interesting manner if there is a

1673
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:53,679
duplicate but is if there is none then

1674
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:56,018
if you are in mixed environment you

1675
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,879
still did to do that so it's a

1676
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:59,590
broadcaster but you don't have to wait

1677
01:17:57,879 --> 01:18:01,409
for the answer no but normally you

1678
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:04,209
should wait one second but we have a dad

1679
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:07,209
so optimistic that is what I represented

1680
01:18:04,209 --> 01:18:08,679
here so you send in our ass with no SLA

1681
01:18:07,209 --> 01:18:09,369
oh because you cannot wait that's the

1682
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:12,999
RFC

1683
01:18:09,369 --> 01:18:15,339
and if the router doesn't have a

1684
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:17,139
neighbour cache for you then it will try

1685
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:18,789
to respond unicast if he tries to

1686
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:21,489
respond Unocal that mean you will look

1687
01:18:18,789 --> 01:18:24,728
you up and that you can respond by your

1688
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:26,739
dad ok so with this little nslookup

1689
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:29,199
which is also broadcast you respond with

1690
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:33,608
adonai you being the backbone router the

1691
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:36,070
proxy right and and now the default

1692
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:38,469
router as a state for you and now the

1693
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:40,299
packets can flow both directions once

1694
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:41,709
again let the items are to chaos

1695
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,570
I mean the traffic I started for a long

1696
01:18:41,709 --> 01:18:45,370
time

1697
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:49,389
this is how you can make this six work

1698
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:50,470
in a matter of split-second so that's

1699
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:53,350
pretty much what we're after

1700
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:55,270
so we also change the Dow tag because if

1701
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:57,010
you see this picture in this case the

1702
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:58,930
six thousand is not directly connected

1703
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,390
to the internet it's a real nice guy so

1704
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:03,520
the request is actually done by the

1705
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:06,340
sixth via on the elf and the lookup

1706
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,240
could be that way as well so we extended

1707
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,220
the dyrdek

1708
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,590
exchange which is normally phone for

1709
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:15,700
that so that you can also do a gap with

1710
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:17,350
it otherwise it's well it's almost zero

1711
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:20,679
extension to what we already have it's

1712
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:25,300
mostly placing it on the backbone so I

1713
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:27,400
had to add a new new value for the

1714
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:30,370
father it encodes a not found which did

1715
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:40,000
not exist for that obviously and that's

1716
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:42,880
pretty much it I want nothing you know I

1717
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,950
want this work to happen I don't have

1718
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:50,200
any religion of where it's just that

1719
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:52,480
well Suresh knows baby I mean we should

1720
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:55,000
first 4:06 mine see how it is received

1721
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,769
that okay so I'm presenting this to

1722
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:04,510
presentation to watch expand you have

1723
01:19:56,770 --> 01:20:06,850
ten minutes to do it but well I already

1724
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:10,210
knew like they did set me back my slides

1725
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:11,860
and say well give me three so that's a

1726
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:13,570
lot less but at least I could give all

1727
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:16,530
this background information nice I hope

1728
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,530
it was useful to you guys

1729
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:59,020
okay this is sort of an experiment on my

1730
01:20:52,420 --> 01:21:03,100
my part I'm working with a Zhang Zhang

1731
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:04,780
and Lee Gwang bong at least that's my

1732
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:09,100
attempt at pronouncing their names and I

1733
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:12,009
apologize for how bad it was on this the

1734
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:16,180
original idea came from Zhang actually

1735
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:17,890
not from me and it's called asymmetric a

1736
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:22,570
ipv6 because it has to be called

1737
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:27,160
something so what's the motivation for

1738
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:31,299
this you know this the physical MTU size

1739
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:33,820
and bitrate may be very small in edge

1740
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:39,400
deployments at least a very highly

1741
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:44,019
constrained node additionally the edge

1742
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:48,339
router the first top router may be very

1743
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:50,470
constrained and the thesis behind this

1744
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:55,930
work is that in a very constrained

1745
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:57,880
router the traditional compression and

1746
01:21:55,930 --> 01:22:00,600
decompression algorithms use resources

1747
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:04,270
that you don't want to use and that

1748
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:07,690
sacrilege 128-bit addresses consume

1749
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:09,990
memory you know they consumer me in ribs

1750
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:13,480
and films and they consume memory in

1751
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:16,410
buffers and so on so the approach is to

1752
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:19,330
tackle those two problems simultaneously

1753
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:20,980
the fact that traditional compression

1754
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:25,269
decompression takes time and the fact

1755
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:27,669
that big addresses take memory the way

1756
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:31,810
to approach it is to make the addresses

1757
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:33,020
shorter obviously inside the ipv6

1758
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:34,670
packets

1759
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:38,060
do the routing based on shortened

1760
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:42,470
addresses not to transmit any

1761
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:44,650
unnecessary bytes and avoid the overhead

1762
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:48,860
of compression decompression algorithms

1763
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:52,969
in the process of forwarding the packet

1764
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:56,509
through a router right how this would

1765
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:59,210
mix and play with other solutions is

1766
01:22:56,510 --> 01:23:00,470
definitely for for further study I

1767
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:03,860
should say that right at the front

1768
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:07,670
otherwise Pascal will stop bouncing up

1769
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:10,639
and down I said suspect so the method is

1770
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:13,180
to within a domain there has to be a

1771
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:15,530
finite domain within which supplies

1772
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:19,490
define an address length or call it N

1773
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:22,040
and all addresses inside the domain are

1774
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:25,580
assumed to have a common prefix of 128

1775
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:27,920
minus and bits so in other words there

1776
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:30,650
is a prefix which everyone agrees on is

1777
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:35,960
the prefix it's relevant within that

1778
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:37,160
domain and outside the domain we're

1779
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,780
going to be using hundred and twenty

1780
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,240
eight bit addresses with that prefix

1781
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:43,580
stuck on the front to complete the

1782
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,800
address so the ribs and phipps can use

1783
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:50,450
short addresses for inter domain

1784
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:53,360
forwarding and any forwarding to the

1785
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:55,820
outside world or from the outside world

1786
01:23:53,360 --> 01:24:00,799
towards this domain will use the full

1787
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:03,170
length address so there's going to be

1788
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,660
some slightly strange business going on

1789
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:10,940
and the router that sits between the

1790
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:13,220
domain and full-length IP unnecessary

1791
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:17,000
head about simply missed out that's so a

1792
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:20,510
fairly obvious thing to do and to do all

1793
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,480
that the idea is to use what we call

1794
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:25,280
flexible header encoding so the headers

1795
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:28,339
are not in a fixed format they're enos

1796
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:31,750
somewhat flexible format fast Carles

1797
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:31,750
begins you jump up and down

1798
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:42,530
yeah okay yeah so within the domain the

1799
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,870
first thing you have to do is decide

1800
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:47,599
what the address length is everyone has

1801
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:49,790
to agree on that obviously that could be

1802
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,890
configured by a manufacturer it could be

1803
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:55,330
configured by operators could be

1804
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:58,310
configured by users actually or it's

1805
01:24:55,330 --> 01:25:02,300
parameterised in some way and a gateway

1806
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:04,400
between the this domain and the rest of

1807
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,650
the world communicates their dress

1808
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,990
lengths to everybody else or it could

1809
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:12,500
even be negotiated so that this is still

1810
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:19,790
completely open right exactly how you

1811
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:22,490
would do that this is getting a bit

1812
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:27,320
specific and I must say is cramping in

1813
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:30,769
the room hope so I didn't do this slide

1814
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:35,080
and this is a suggestion that to make

1815
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:39,470
this work we would have to we could add

1816
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:44,570
flag to the standard ipv6 RA which says

1817
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:49,340
that some if you receive the sorry you

1818
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:54,259
can use symmetric ipv6 mechanism and the

1819
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:56,330
prefix would be modified prefix

1820
01:25:54,260 --> 01:26:01,540
information on to tell you what the

1821
01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:01,540
prefix was and what its length was

1822
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:16,170
address configuration if that bit is set

1823
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:18,030
in the RA yeah I don't even know if I

1824
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:22,079
need to go through these these details

1825
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:24,900
you can do that as homework you know it

1826
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:32,420
becomes algorithmically possible for a

1827
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:41,638
node to compute its it's an address and

1828
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:48,840
fairly obvious way and all this needs to

1829
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:50,820
be reduced to precise language and and

1830
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,409
algorithms which are not in the current

1831
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:54,090
draft all right because this is this

1832
01:26:52,409 --> 01:26:59,190
this thing is changing in front of your

1833
01:26:54,090 --> 01:27:02,550
face as we as we speak and a lot of what

1834
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:05,388
you know you probably have to execute

1835
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:10,440
some kind of duplicate address detection

1836
01:27:05,389 --> 01:27:12,389
before you can bind the address but it's

1837
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:15,808
all fairly fairly intuitive I think once

1838
01:27:12,389 --> 01:27:18,570
you know that that address length is

1839
01:27:15,809 --> 01:27:24,329
communicated to you in DRA as well as

1840
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:26,400
the prefix then what you actually put on

1841
01:27:24,329 --> 01:27:33,570
the wire well this is where it gets a

1842
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:39,619
little bit strange one way is to use a

1843
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:42,630
new dispatch value in 6lowpan terms and

1844
01:27:39,619 --> 01:27:44,759
the other value the other approach is T

1845
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:47,099
is to use this flexible header encoding

1846
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:51,590
concept where the packet actually starts

1847
01:27:47,099 --> 01:27:51,590
with a flexible header encoding octet

1848
01:27:54,170 --> 01:28:01,729
which has obviously eight bits in it

1849
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:03,989
which have very significant and then

1850
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:05,429
because eight bits may not be quite

1851
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:06,869
enough you've got another four bits you

1852
01:28:05,429 --> 01:28:09,630
can use a normally called a version

1853
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:14,190
number it's always contain zero one one

1854
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:16,650
zero so why not use those bits as well

1855
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:18,230
since they're actually no use in an ipv6

1856
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:20,320
packet

1857
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:23,620
so that gives you that gives you

1858
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:26,150
basically 12 bits in which you can

1859
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:28,190
indicate which fields are actually

1860
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:31,099
present in the header so this example

1861
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:34,790
there's a payload length there's a next

1862
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:36,830
header standard ipv6 next header there's

1863
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:39,230
a hop limit and there's a truncated

1864
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:41,540
destination address truncated because it

1865
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:43,549
is under the domain prefix you don't

1866
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:48,200
need to include the domain prefix bits

1867
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:50,180
and there's no source address because

1868
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:56,870
well people know your source address

1869
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:59,690
anyway from your MAC address once once

1870
01:28:56,870 --> 01:29:01,280
you're in the nd cache your source

1871
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:06,950
addresses associated with your MAC

1872
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:09,469
address look it up backwards yeah of

1873
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:10,760
course you could you can't use this for

1874
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:17,720
the first packet because nobody knows

1875
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:20,690
who you are and and in in the draft

1876
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:24,880
you'll find that layout of those those

1877
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:28,669
bits and how they work for example the

1878
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:31,790
the version number bits it's in small

1879
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:34,220
print at the bottom if the version

1880
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:38,830
number bits say zero you're going to be

1881
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:41,030
carrying for 128 bit addresses in the

1882
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:43,460
destination but the source address is

1883
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:49,969
truncated to the domain specific length

1884
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:52,340
and so on and it turns out we even got

1885
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:53,690
some reserved values among among the

1886
01:29:52,340 --> 01:30:01,130
bits because there are quite a few of

1887
01:29:53,690 --> 01:30:02,929
them yes yes notify my notic we I'm

1888
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:06,080
working in LP one in compression

1889
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:08,990
mechanism but this call chic and chic is

1890
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,490
not in the same area because it's on LP

1891
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:13,219
one network so you have a star topology

1892
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:15,760
and we don't need address but these

1893
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:19,070
things looks to make the link between

1894
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,710
loop loop and networks and LP ones

1895
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:23,630
because if you look at what we have

1896
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:26,780
defined in cheek we we have a rule ID

1897
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:29,480
that defines the compressed format we

1898
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:31,790
are sending on the network and then we

1899
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,429
are able to compress hitter

1900
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:36,740
to suppress some of them or to reduce as

1901
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:38,690
a size with the mechanisms that are

1902
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:41,080
inside the shaker yeah I heard about

1903
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:45,169
shake about an hour ago

1904
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:47,480
and I haven't read it yet but you know

1905
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:50,000
obviously this is early stage work and

1906
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:57,950
if we can swap ideas and combine ideas

1907
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:59,720
that will be a good thing yeah yeah

1908
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:01,639
suresh krisshnan so no excuse for not

1909
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:05,780
knowing chick everybody had t-shirts for

1910
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:08,030
like the last few meetings no heidi hat

1911
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:09,380
i think like one issue i see right away

1912
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:11,120
with this header format is like the

1913
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:13,010
alignment like all the bit fields are

1914
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,660
like not aligned so like the payload

1915
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,310
lengths like the 16-bit field with no

1916
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:20,860
alignment same with the hop limit I

1917
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:23,990
think if you're putting in C's yeah yeah

1918
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:25,519
I agree they're not aligned but if you

1919
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:29,210
know this stuff is going to go into

1920
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:32,660
custom Asics and games different anyway

1921
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:34,180
right so if you're coding and see some

1922
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:41,930
of its a bit of a nuisance I agree

1923
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:47,930
that's not the whole universe there's

1924
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:50,210
not much more so okay this basically

1925
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:52,130
points out that the gateway between the

1926
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:57,260
domain and the rest of the world has to

1927
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:58,820
expand or contract addresses you know so

1928
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:01,370
if something arrives the short address

1929
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:03,250
it has to and has to go out he has to

1930
01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:06,830
expand it to the full length address and

1931
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:08,330
in the opposite direction coming in that

1932
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:10,550
with inside the domain you could

1933
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:13,400
communicate entirely using the shortened

1934
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:15,410
addresses and in some cases with no

1935
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,860
source address because that's implicit

1936
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,860
anyway

1937
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:33,270
yeah there is theoretically an option

1938
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:37,950
that you could even consortin the

1939
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:42,920
addresses of external modes by giving

1940
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:46,769
them a sort of proxy address internally

1941
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:50,370
so that's you know another name for

1942
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:52,080
doing that isn't that so obviously some

1943
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:56,010
of the traditional NAT problems that

1944
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:58,559
arise but but you you you're not obliged

1945
01:32:56,010 --> 01:33:01,620
necessarily to use hundred and trade 28

1946
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,540
bit addresses for outside nodes either

1947
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:09,240
I think that's all I want to say about

1948
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:13,190
that slide so that basically is all we

1949
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:18,660
wanted to say there is this idea we

1950
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:21,240
don't know who might want to work with

1951
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:23,340
us we might be told it's all rubbish

1952
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:27,660
Sheng is sitting at the back so he can

1953
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:29,040
add his comments if he likes Sheng why

1954
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:33,599
didn't you go to a microphone so you can

1955
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:36,780
help to answer the questions hello come

1956
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:41,450
home from Huawei one of the author of

1957
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:45,599
these graphs the main requirement from

1958
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:50,070
very simple scenarios like supermarket

1959
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:53,610
and and the point-wise are very simple

1960
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:55,320
and the resource limited so they will

1961
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:59,880
test the one to talk to

1962
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:05,429
talk with each other and only maybe only

1963
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:09,900
with crises source and destination so

1964
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:12,260
here to talk to will so the problem for

1965
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:16,860
how to address and the points and

1966
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:21,810
there's no other functions so a bv6 may

1967
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:26,360
be so heavy for this scenario and I also

1968
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:31,910
know there are many perfect compression

1969
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:36,330
approaches like a stick and six oppa but

1970
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:37,340
but which may need to compress compress

1971
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:40,940
and the

1972
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:43,130
comprise when when community when

1973
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:48,799
communicated with each other

1974
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:51,190
here we just wanted to mostly reuse at

1975
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:58,340
v6 Sikkema

1976
01:34:51,190 --> 01:35:00,049
to so common problems thank you yeah we

1977
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:02,840
perhaps need to say more about use cases

1978
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:06,740
in the in the draft actually passed

1979
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:09,050
consumer first thing yes yes I just sent

1980
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:11,980
you this email like I knew there is also

1981
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:16,400
eighty one thirty eight to look at

1982
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:19,759
eighty one thirty eight has pretty much

1983
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:21,920
the concepts that you elaborate in mind

1984
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,750
actually the problems that you're

1985
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,010
talking about this is the right place to

1986
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,210
talk about it first

1987
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,620
I mean this is the right group because

1988
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:29,810
that's kind of the prime of the nucleoid

1989
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:31,849
fall temperatures right so you're in the

1990
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:34,810
right place and obviously we did a lot

1991
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:37,670
and thought in many different directions

1992
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:39,110
now and when I just look at what you you

1993
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:41,930
proposed first there is this argument

1994
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:44,660
that compression is difficult well the

1995
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:47,000
six top and compression difficult is a

1996
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:48,320
hard world but I think saying that what

1997
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,910
you do is not a compression it's

1998
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,290
actually fallacy because you're doing

1999
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:53,690
pretty much the same thing as we are

2000
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:54,950
doing yeah right so saying I'm not doing

2001
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:56,419
compression you're doing compression so

2002
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:57,559
my stuff is good your stuff is not what

2003
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:00,140
you're doing same thing as we're doing

2004
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:03,200
now the other argument which is very

2005
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:05,060
interesting is can I process the packet

2006
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,800
in that format like a that rocket I

2007
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:10,700
wrote in that formatting can I receive

2008
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:12,680
the packet in that format and well it's

2009
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,510
true that's that's really important and

2010
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:16,820
if you look at it once create when you

2011
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:18,890
have time or in stats sake you realize

2012
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,750
that it's completely designed to be

2013
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:22,370
forward in the compressed format to be

2014
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:23,660
operated in the compressed format you

2015
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:26,780
never want to look at the original

2016
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:28,490
format but its equivalent and just like

2017
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:31,340
it is saying exactly I mean we shall so

2018
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:33,320
much the goals I mean they did we did

2019
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:34,880
not want to have to transmit address in

2020
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,130
the for want to transmit them in a

2021
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:39,920
compressed version now we did not want

2022
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:41,990
to enforce the same compression for all

2023
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,180
addresses in the domain like for now

2024
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:46,340
you're doing we can actually decide

2025
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:50,090
address poetry so much we compress it

2026
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:51,260
and we can actually place your source

2027
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:53,720
for today which is very

2028
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:55,550
in low power devices right sometimes you

2029
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,460
can't have state or out of our multiple

2030
01:36:55,550 --> 01:37:01,220
hops so we also thought about oh how can

2031
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:02,930
I write is this packet as you want to

2032
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,580
write it such a way that is very easy to

2033
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:05,720
afford

2034
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:07,250
and like you said the source is not

2035
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,650
important what's important like the

2036
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:11,360
destination but if you do so swatting is

2037
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:13,309
not just the first of destinations just

2038
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,530
all the other destinations and then you

2039
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:16,820
start singing a do I like the SWOT that

2040
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:19,219
they have to do between the rotting

2041
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:21,139
adder and the IPO now let's let's remove

2042
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,670
that anyway I don't care about keeping

2043
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:25,430
the old chain so why don't I put it in

2044
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:27,739
the beginning and cut stuff so realize

2045
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:29,780
that the kind of thing that started this

2046
01:37:27,739 --> 01:37:32,660
draft this is the kind of thinking we've

2047
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:34,280
had for like ten years and and we

2048
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:37,550
weren't very very fine that direction

2049
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:38,900
actually so so I really want to work

2050
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:40,460
with you on understanding you know is

2051
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,960
there a gap that we have not covered yet

2052
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,700
so far I've not seen that gap in your

2053
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,350
presentation I think we're covered

2054
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,540
already to do watch what you want to

2055
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:49,310
achieve in particular you don't have to

2056
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:51,500
expand anything you can work with the

2057
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:53,330
compressed formats she could understand

2058
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:58,130
the conference format whyever work with

2059
01:37:53,330 --> 01:38:01,550
the uncompressed format within the drain

2060
01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:03,500
yes I agree and that the border router

2061
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:05,780
yes you have to do the compression

2062
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,160
decompression and like I said I think

2063
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:09,380
it's a fallacy to Kali to that that

2064
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:11,210
patient layer you care I mean but it is

2065
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:12,860
but but it does compression the

2066
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:14,330
compression that's what it does you've

2067
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:15,820
shown me to format when it's smaller

2068
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:19,309
than the other I call that a compression

2069
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:21,290
right saying I avoid the process and now

2070
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:23,239
you can just say oh my compression is

2071
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:25,130
simpler than yours well we can discuss a

2072
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:27,019
beauty contest if you like and we can

2073
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:29,570
improve 6lowpan if you promise that we

2074
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:32,000
can do better but we are in the very

2075
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:33,679
same family we have very same goals and

2076
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,200
we've pretty much achieve what you claim

2077
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:38,390
you're after and for some things I think

2078
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:41,120
we did it better like like the size of

2079
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:43,940
the compress thing we can we are much

2080
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:45,410
more elastic now for other things maybe

2081
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:47,330
you have a better portion we can improve

2082
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:48,830
what with it but you're not starting

2083
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:55,510
from scratch we've had a lot of

2084
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:55,510
experience on that next

2085
01:38:56,709 --> 01:39:02,889
Carlos Gomez thank you for bringing this

2086
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:05,380
work and for the presentation as a

2087
01:39:02,889 --> 01:39:08,439
participant and I'm curious I don't know

2088
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:12,610
if maybe you have any sort of evaluation

2089
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:16,059
some kind of quantification of the

2090
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:18,268
effect of minimizing or avoiding the

2091
01:39:16,059 --> 01:39:20,349
compression because I understand that

2092
01:39:18,269 --> 01:39:23,320
avoiding the compression is one of the

2093
01:39:20,349 --> 01:39:25,209
main points in your proposal so I don't

2094
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:27,369
know if you have any sort of evolution

2095
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:32,860
the people degree answer that is

2096
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:37,869
standing behind you yeah actually the

2097
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:41,949
decision actually is a motivation we had

2098
01:39:37,869 --> 01:39:44,289
use what we saw in 6lowpan versus you

2099
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:47,949
know compression and decompression and

2100
01:39:44,289 --> 01:39:51,099
it has to do every hope when it goes to

2101
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:54,188
layers way without him but what we want

2102
01:39:51,099 --> 01:39:57,309
to is we had this address be able to

2103
01:39:54,189 --> 01:40:01,209
build up the routing table within the

2104
01:39:57,309 --> 01:40:04,449
domain without any camera temperature

2105
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:08,260
and decompressing so in that way

2106
01:40:04,449 --> 01:40:12,030
actually you know in ways in the domain

2107
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:16,719
there's only necessary address as

2108
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:25,780
limited as possible yes so that's for

2109
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:27,010
every note and for every package Pascal

2110
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:28,959
again that's an interesting discussion

2111
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:31,150
because I I like the behavior as you

2112
01:40:28,959 --> 01:40:35,170
described it right it's a behavior thing

2113
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:39,549
it's not a format thing and so right now

2114
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:41,380
it's in formats right I I claim that

2115
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:44,469
with the format's we having 6lowpan you

2116
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:46,510
can do exactly that you can be at the

2117
01:40:44,469 --> 01:40:47,949
writing table in such a way that if you

2118
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:49,300
know for instance that you're in a repo

2119
01:40:47,949 --> 01:40:50,438
to your deck just to give you an example

2120
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,070
because we built for that

2121
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:55,630
and and you know you know what's the the

2122
01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:58,869
size of the bits which always come and

2123
01:40:55,630 --> 01:41:00,969
then actually we have a context that we

2124
01:40:58,869 --> 01:41:03,159
distribute through our eyes that tells

2125
01:41:00,969 --> 01:41:04,959
us what this context is and we can

2126
01:41:03,159 --> 01:41:07,388
actually remove that from everything and

2127
01:41:04,959 --> 01:41:09,849
now and in all the packets you see only

2128
01:41:07,389 --> 01:41:10,360
the rest and now having a routing table

2129
01:41:09,849 --> 01:41:11,560
which

2130
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:13,059
sometimes I'll need at rest it's

2131
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:15,310
completely an implementation it's not

2132
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:16,869
visible from the outside so you can

2133
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,320
really build it we never said don't do

2134
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:19,210
that

2135
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:22,090
it's just copy to your back to to the

2136
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:23,650
outside we've processed the packet we

2137
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:26,260
can process the packet in a compressed

2138
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:28,059
format and we don't mostly relate for

2139
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:29,639
eight one three eight right we just snip

2140
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:32,199
the first of the destination addresses

2141
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:34,360
which is just like a rotten either just

2142
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:36,638
need the first and fold it's very simple

2143
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:38,199
and if your table watching table

2144
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:40,179
contains eight bytes power twice because

2145
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:42,879
you know the first date a command that's

2146
01:41:40,179 --> 01:41:44,560
that's fine it's your implementation so

2147
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,659
I can we do that already

2148
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,150
now we could describe you know that

2149
01:41:46,659 --> 01:41:56,559
operation inside the box the format's we

2150
01:41:49,150 --> 01:42:00,040
have already enabled ok Husker I could

2151
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:02,050
agree on you know what to claim the

2152
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:05,070
6lowpan actually could do that but

2153
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:09,040
actually that's a problem because the

2154
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:12,219
6lowpan actually described a framework

2155
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:16,900
could have many different subgroup of it

2156
01:42:12,219 --> 01:42:19,420
but to do that each of them the actor a

2157
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:23,110
basic slope a framework that become

2158
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:26,710
complicated so you can say what we're

2159
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:29,049
doing is a simplified brushing of you

2160
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:34,600
know 6lowpan that's fine I don't care

2161
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:37,630
what I care is you know those constraint

2162
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:44,820
note could do it in the simplest way and

2163
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:47,889
save the energy for them to be proven

2164
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:50,619
right I mean think for a second about

2165
01:42:47,889 --> 01:42:53,020
the dalvik work that we did that custom

2166
01:42:50,619 --> 01:42:56,170
did for fragments it was enabled by

2167
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:58,210
6lowpan but nobody wrote that you could

2168
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:00,010
have this behavior so those documents

2169
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:01,449
and fragmentation fragment forwarding

2170
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:06,190
and and they're weak draft where are

2171
01:43:01,449 --> 01:43:08,349
useful they will be proceeded but they

2172
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:10,419
did not need to change the format so

2173
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:12,909
what I'm saying is if you could have a

2174
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:15,159
simplest behavior or a subset of the

2175
01:43:12,909 --> 01:43:17,500
behavior by documenting that behavior

2176
01:43:15,159 --> 01:43:20,320
that's auto gon also providing new

2177
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:21,670
formats but I'm claiming so far I'm not

2178
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,829
saying that we have documented the

2179
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:25,689
behavior that you talked about and I did

2180
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:27,579
say it's not useful to document it I

2181
01:43:25,689 --> 01:43:29,079
said you don't necessarily want to

2182
01:43:27,579 --> 01:43:31,419
change the formats to get it because the

2183
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:33,039
format's we have allow it so far for

2184
01:43:31,419 --> 01:43:34,148
what I've seen right it may be in the

2185
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:36,039
details which show me that we miss

2186
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:39,699
something and then you can elaborate on

2187
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:41,320
the format's you have look at 81 38 as a

2188
01:43:39,699 --> 01:43:55,178
starting point about the format's we

2189
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:58,959
have yeah we will okay so we have a

2190
01:43:55,179 --> 01:44:05,289
start meeting Wednesday morning 8:30 in

2191
01:43:58,959 --> 01:44:06,969
not Radel which is somewhere close and

2192
01:44:05,289 --> 01:44:09,009
we're discussing another draft as well

2193
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:11,649
but if anybody has time at 8:30 on

2194
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:13,839
Wednesday morning please come along that

2195
01:44:11,649 --> 01:44:17,199
would be very helpful okay how would the

2196
01:44:13,839 --> 01:44:22,689
last comments here we want to argue

2197
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:26,678
which is vaster formatting here inside

2198
01:44:22,689 --> 01:44:30,669
we want to say the compression maybe

2199
01:44:26,679 --> 01:44:33,969
it's beautiful unanswered 84 and also

2200
01:44:30,669 --> 01:44:37,809
there for compression context is it very

2201
01:44:33,969 --> 01:44:42,010
important here we think if we can

2202
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:46,659
standardize context in the in the drafts

2203
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:49,169
and then on running on running

2204
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:55,598
environment we don't need that anymore

2205
01:44:49,169 --> 01:44:59,010
so we assume we can config lanes of the

2206
01:44:55,599 --> 01:45:03,280
road twice when deploy when deploy an

2207
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:05,889
employer devices okay

2208
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:08,228
can we request you to add a section in

2209
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:09,999
the draft to compare and contrast with

2210
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:17,229
the existing solutions and come back to

2211
01:45:09,999 --> 01:45:22,239
success yes for example if we if we want

2212
01:45:17,229 --> 01:45:26,339
to adopt a cheek schema to do the

2213
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:31,289
formatting and we we can standardize

2214
01:45:26,339 --> 01:45:32,499
which rules can be used for the

2215
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:35,849
symmetric

2216
01:45:32,499 --> 01:45:35,849
epi okay

2217
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:42,849
Pascal I think the line is cut off isn't

2218
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:44,110
it yeah or I just wanted to make like

2219
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:46,690
one point there I think that's

2220
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:48,549
absolutely important that like the the

2221
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:50,559
motivation for this is there I think

2222
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:52,600
Brian like touched on it a bit I think

2223
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,330
it's best certain down in the draft like

2224
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:56,710
why and I fully suppose that like you

2225
01:45:55,330 --> 01:45:59,140
know just writing down like why the

2226
01:45:56,710 --> 01:46:01,750
current mechanisms are not sufficient

2227
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:02,920
and also in addition to that I would

2228
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:05,170
like to see some of the requirements

2229
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:06,640
because like you mentioned about like

2230
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:08,110
you know what is needed and like what's

2231
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,910
the use cases I think Brian touched on

2232
01:46:08,110 --> 01:46:11,410
it too I think if it all goes in the

2233
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:12,760
traffic's really good because people can

2234
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:23,620
actually make their determination

2235
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:25,000
themselves johnny is up next he's

2236
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:29,140
presenting it

2237
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:35,380
he's a remote present so should he raise

2238
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:37,540
his hand to rejoin the Kim Chavez brats

2239
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:39,720
that would help us make you the

2240
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,720
presenter

2241
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,420
Jolley if you're in Miyako there is a

2242
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:38,660
button to enter the queue which sits in

2243
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:45,530
the left right okay well this is my

2244
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:48,250
first well let's see I don't exactly

2245
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:51,980
know how it all goes

2246
01:47:48,250 --> 01:48:02,780
do i do I do something to advance to the

2247
01:47:51,980 --> 01:48:08,059
next slide okay we'll go ahead so this

2248
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:10,580
is a deadline draft is about a new

2249
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:14,740
routing header pipe that carries

2250
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:17,420
information about to enable better

2251
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:20,150
delivery of packets that have the

2252
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:23,590
delivery constraint on delivery

2253
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:26,719
constraints so that means that the

2254
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:29,650
devices that received a packet with this

2255
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:32,930
header and make the right decision about

2256
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:37,009
scheduling their delivery to the next

2257
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:40,400
next top requirement and the assumption

2258
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:44,650
is that the network devices are time

2259
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:47,330
synchronized and there's a little bit of

2260
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:50,299
specification to don't how to handle

2261
01:48:47,330 --> 01:48:53,120
different time zones this this is

2262
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:55,520
basically the idea of the draft and it's

2263
01:48:53,120 --> 01:49:00,590
been pretty much the same for a lot of

2264
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:03,260
time makes Lyde please so this shows the

2265
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:05,510
history of the draft I guess I don't

2266
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:09,020
really I need to go through this too

2267
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:13,280
much this is we have another revision

2268
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:15,560
out recently and that's where the focus

2269
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:20,660
of this discussion this more

2270
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:22,250
we'll be Oh see yeah I don't think

2271
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:24,550
there's anything else that needs to be

2272
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:29,180
said about this slide next slide please

2273
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:32,300
the current status is that there's been

2274
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:39,010
quite many reviews and it's under isg

2275
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:42,770
evaluation and we had some discuss

2276
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:47,120
points particularly about how it is that

2277
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:50,240
of the new routing header could be

2278
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:53,840
abused by those wishing to take unfair

2279
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:56,900
advantage by claiming that their data

2280
01:49:53,840 --> 01:50:01,280
needs to be treated with a short

2281
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:04,129
delivery time and so there was some text

2282
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:07,480
added to the security associations who

2283
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:10,520
basically say yes this is a problem but

2284
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:13,490
if you have devices in your network that

2285
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:15,170
can make sense of unfair advantage then

2286
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:17,840
you probably have other problems as well

2287
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:21,560
and so the assumption is that the

2288
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:24,190
devices are deployed in a way that

2289
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:27,010
allows them to cooperate effectively

2290
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:34,030
next slide please

2291
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:37,850
yeah hi I'm Kelli and this is Sarah sure

2292
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:39,920
hey yeah yeah so one of the things I

2293
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:43,270
haven't seen as a response to Alice's

2294
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:45,650
discuss at all so I saw you responded to

2295
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:47,870
Roman and Magnus but I haven't seen a

2296
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:50,450
response at all so I was kind of like

2297
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:51,309
trying to match up to the responses but

2298
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:54,470
I didn't see any

2299
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:56,720
so my if you made changes like I think

2300
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:59,410
it'll be good like this put the changes

2301
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:05,380
into a response to her discuss and

2302
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:08,330
discussing in the is points and maybe

2303
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:11,210
I'll just go back and check I mean I'm

2304
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:12,950
quite sure that the the email went out

2305
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:15,410
whether or not it went out yeah

2306
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:17,480
specifically tagged as a response to

2307
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:19,730
this discuss from for instance those it

2308
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:26,440
says I don't know that so I'll check to

2309
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:28,120
be sure okay that's fine

2310
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:29,650
just let me know charlie that point me

2311
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,780
to it and then I'll take it from there

2312
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:33,870
right like so I think the I think the

2313
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:36,280
mail or sent like 15 of May or something

2314
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:38,830
Alyssa I think it's the day before the

2315
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:40,150
tele chat just go look it up and if you

2316
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:42,130
think it's a dress just like this one

2317
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:45,190
email or just send me a private knot and

2318
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:47,010
I'll make sure I follow up this week you

2319
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:53,530
bet

2320
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:56,800
okay and then Shelley's so as mentioned

2321
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:59,080
I there was a new newer material in the

2322
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:02,440
security consideration so about the

2323
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:05,320
expected deployment scenarios well

2324
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:08,830
actually don't that's that was a

2325
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:13,690
separate request who for us to describe

2326
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:16,870
how in our expectation the document

2327
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:19,620
would be implemented and deployed for

2328
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:24,580
what purposes so so there was some

2329
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:27,550
discussion about that and now with a lot

2330
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:29,889
of Corrections made it's amazing how

2331
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:34,989
many little places are to make mistakes

2332
01:52:29,889 --> 01:52:39,219
and also it it was a pretty good amount

2333
01:52:34,989 --> 01:52:43,259
of material added several paragraphs to

2334
01:52:39,219 --> 01:52:45,550
describe really how to go about using

2335
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:48,880
shorter time ranges so that you don't

2336
01:52:45,550 --> 01:52:51,280
always have to use the maximum number of

2337
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:54,760
bits to specify what the deadline time

2338
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:58,690
is or the origination time Delta and so

2339
01:52:54,760 --> 01:53:01,690
I think that hopefully this revision of

2340
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:04,809
the slides that has a page about that

2341
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:08,290
which I'll describe a little bit more

2342
01:53:04,810 --> 01:53:11,139
but several people notice that there was

2343
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:13,510
basically some arithmetic errors and all

2344
01:53:11,139 --> 01:53:19,030
those things were corrected and as well

2345
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:21,310
as for clarifications and and believe it

2346
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:23,290
or not there was one place where the

2347
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:25,840
order of the description of the fields

2348
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:28,170
didn't match the order of the fields as

2349
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:32,889
they were laid out in the routing header

2350
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:35,290
so so all those things were done and I

2351
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:38,380
think that we have responded to all the

2352
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:39,620
comments and discusses and suggestions

2353
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:47,690
for improvement

2354
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:50,090
on next slide please so so this

2355
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:53,570
basically is the same as it's been

2356
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:56,510
except for slight Corrections so for

2357
01:53:53,570 --> 01:54:03,380
example if you look under the deadline

2358
01:53:56,510 --> 01:54:05,660
time value the minimum amount of

2359
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:09,080
deadline time is shown you know the

2360
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:10,940
minimum can I say yo if you're going to

2361
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:14,720
send a packet you have a deadline time

2362
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:17,330
so the minimum DTL the deadline time

2363
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:26,630
length is zero which means that you can

2364
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:29,059
have a one hex digit and so that so that

2365
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:34,040
shows that the and then a maximum number

2366
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:36,290
then is 1650 so the deadline time cannot

2367
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:39,650
be specified in a small number of bits

2368
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:43,820
or I can use the whole 64 bits the

2369
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:45,889
origination time Delta is to be

2370
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:48,679
subtracted from the deadline time and

2371
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:50,330
that can be anywhere from zero to twenty

2372
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:53,540
eight bits because it's it's only a

2373
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:57,110
three bit field then you can only go up

2374
01:54:53,540 --> 01:55:02,890
to seven and seven times four bits is 28

2375
01:54:57,110 --> 01:55:02,889
bits next flag next slide please

2376
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:15,470
and the last line of this slideshow I

2377
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:23,390
don't hear talking about Daenerys okay

2378
01:55:15,470 --> 01:55:25,220
well let's say eventually you have just

2379
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:28,160
in case you copied it over from your

2380
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:30,890
draft well I didn't actually copy it and

2381
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:32,840
due to circumstances I didn't see these

2382
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:40,880
slides till today

2383
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:42,520
so let's see this was are you saying

2384
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:49,389
this was copied over from the previous

2385
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:51,820
presentation or I'm sorry

2386
01:55:49,389 --> 01:55:55,719
didn't quite get them but anyway there

2387
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:58,978
was one more slide in the corrected

2388
01:55:55,719 --> 01:56:02,979
presentation set that shows how

2389
01:55:58,979 --> 01:56:04,510
wraparound works and I guess I'm not

2390
01:56:02,979 --> 01:56:08,110
going to have a chance to present that

2391
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:11,320
at last slide here but if I can describe

2392
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:13,659
it verbally what it what the effect of

2393
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:16,808
it is is to if you look at your

2394
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:19,058
synchronized timeline as maybe you can

2395
01:56:16,809 --> 01:56:20,889
say it starts from 0 to and goes to

2396
01:56:19,059 --> 01:56:23,610
infinity or at least what the maximum

2397
01:56:20,889 --> 01:56:27,039
time is then if you want to have a

2398
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:31,719
shorter number of bids to represent the

2399
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:37,599
deadline time maybe your length of the

2400
01:56:31,719 --> 01:56:40,119
deadline time field is is one one extra

2401
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:43,389
so that would make two hex digits which

2402
01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:45,549
gives you from 0 to 256 and basically

2403
01:56:43,389 --> 01:56:51,929
what I tried to describe in the draft is

2404
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:56,679
how choosing a a time interval of length

2405
01:56:51,929 --> 01:57:01,209
256 effectively slices up your your

2406
01:56:56,679 --> 01:57:03,010
entire timeline up into 256 time unit

2407
01:57:01,209 --> 01:57:05,979
intervals and then there's some

2408
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:07,929
wraparound description from that so that

2409
01:57:05,979 --> 01:57:11,709
was intended to be a lot clearer than

2410
01:57:07,929 --> 01:57:15,579
the previous description in that section

2411
01:57:11,709 --> 01:57:19,239
and maybe this verbal account isn't very

2412
01:57:15,579 --> 01:57:23,228
clear but hopefully the new section will

2413
01:57:19,239 --> 01:57:26,009
be much clearer and I guess that's all I

2414
01:57:23,229 --> 01:57:26,010
have to present

2415
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:54,660
okay is there any comment from the

2416
01:57:36,450 --> 01:58:08,460
winning group you know I'm sad to say

2417
01:57:54,660 --> 01:58:10,710
that there's a lot of basically who said

2418
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,160
that yeah there were no questions in the

2419
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:14,670
room

2420
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:29,010
so the next step is the response to a

2421
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:40,800
lease on duty from there I promise to

2422
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:42,680
respond yes close the door perhaps it's

2423
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,900
better now physically we were saying

2424
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:56,940
that there were no Christians in the

2425
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:58,589
room and we expect I will verify and
