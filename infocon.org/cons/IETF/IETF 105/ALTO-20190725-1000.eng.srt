Jensen oh yeah we have a note taker

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,390
right so I think we're all good to go

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,930
just a reminder I think everybody in the

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,580
room knows this and this is an ITF this

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,430
is the ITF policy basically so

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,350
everything here is public domain and

30
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,910
there are certain IPR rules so please

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,869
take a look if you don't know about this

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:32,179
and but we just yeah we want to inform

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,800
you that these routes apply here and

34
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,140
there certain RFC's that state these

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,300
rules and so what is the status of our

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,310
working group and this slide is actually

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,869
not much different than from last time

38
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,200
we are focusing on finishing our

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,340
milestones and we chairs have been

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,040
sticking to that point for quite some

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,810
time now and again we have put up the

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,910
agenda today accordingly so we will have

43
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,100
all the working group items that address

44
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,130
milestones first and then in the end we

45
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,020
have two more presentations on you know

46
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,420
additional stuff that we can discuss how

47
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,720
to how to handle it but most of the

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,610
agenda is for the milestones and so in

49
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,429
in order to make progress Vijay and I

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,349
have agreed that we the remaining draft

51
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,870
after today's meeting we hope that we

52
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,390
can move some out of the working group

53
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,140
even today and but the remaining ones

54
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,970
and we

55
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,679
we'll split amongst ourselves and we

56
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,780
will individually paying the authors to

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,420
make progress by the November ITF so we

58
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,550
can really progress so we will do that

59
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,440
after this session and then basically

60
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,090
you will if you still have if you're an

61
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,459
author of a working group item that is

62
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,260
not done expect frequent mails from the

63
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,870
chairs hey what's the status hey what's

64
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,640
the status yeah yeah sure so I think we

65
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,860
have seven drafts that we are working on

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,380
out of those seven three should be going

67
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:51,560
out to iesg X tome cost calendar and

68
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,480
there is just s SSE so that leaves four

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,700
of them and Jana and I will take two

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,459
each and start hounding you guys to

71
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,899
finish it yes and another thing and it's

72
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,580
good that meals arriving because that's

73
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,930
something and we can also discuss with

74
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,430
her currently there is no meeting

75
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,739
planned for singer pool because Vijay

76
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,360
and I both cannot make it and what I

77
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,489
think we've discussed with me already is

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
that we can again do a virtual interim

79
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,480
but during this week we had and now that

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,280
we have another option came up if some

81
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,890
of you guys and we talked to Sabine

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,630
already and if somebody else wants to

83
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,160
temporarily chair the Working Group just

84
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,810
for the Singapore meeting because lots

85
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,340
of people who will be will be there and

86
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,989
that's something we can certainly

87
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,820
discuss we don't have to discuss it now

88
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,739
we can take it offline with Mary I don't

89
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,570
know how you feel about it it was just

90
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,739
you know both of us cannot be there but

91
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,780
if all the other folks are going to be

92
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,030
there maybe you know somebody can share

93
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,320
the working dress for the Singapore

94
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,769
meeting you have any opinions maybe I

95
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,570
said that's fine right we can do that

96
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:51,410
like to have you remotely participating

97
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:57,709
it is yes you guys yeah participate

98
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:59,989
remotely of course you know we will do

99
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,269
all the agenda collection and uploading

100
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,739
everything it's just for somebody to

101
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:08,420
physically be in the room and we don't

102
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,769
have to decide this today we can take

103
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,679
this offline on the mailing list and

104
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,970
just so you know it's basically both

105
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,620
those are the options so we definitely

106
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,079
got to have a meeting either a virtual

107
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,820
interim or a Singapore meeting where

108
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,070
somebody is chairing instead of us and

109
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:28,070
we will be logging in remotely and yeah

110
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,630
so the agenda M has been posted and as I

111
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,860
said the agenda is pretty

112
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,909
straightforward because we're going to

113
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,650
discuss the

114
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,770
my stones first and then we have the

115
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,960
last two presentations are on on my

116
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,460
stone stuff so we put that at the end

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,760
and I hope we will have time for that

118
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:48,469
and does anybody want to comment on the

119
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,480
agenda any anything no okay I think we

120
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,630
posted a long time ago I mean almost a

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,880
week or something so should be good and

122
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,719
yeah progress we had a meeting in Park

123
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,420
M where basically we made some progress

124
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,090
so just so you know the general status

125
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,750
we have I think seven working group

126
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,640
items like feature set and the first we

127
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,340
you see here on the sub bullets are

128
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,950
almost done so X term is already 9sg

129
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,409
processing they received some comments I

130
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,390
had a lunch with Sebastian last weekend

131
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,770
in Stuttgart and basically they address

132
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,409
these comments and just issued a new

133
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,870
version so now the the ball is in the is

134
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,490
G chord again so sometimes this happens

135
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,350
you kick it to the ist they have some

136
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,500
discusses and you know you need to

137
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,420
reiterate I don't know maybe if you had

138
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,060
the chance to I think we wanted to talk

139
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,100
with one of the IDS right yes sir one

140
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,720
discuss was already resolved in this

141
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,750
another discussed ways probably just

142
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,520
needs some button clicking again but I

143
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,140
also need to look at it so its menu and

144
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,430
me now actually okay yeah so well the

145
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,870
main point is is it's making progress

146
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,140
right so it's out of the working group

147
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,970
anyway and and on course calendar we

148
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,979
finished yet another second working

149
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,510
group last call and we have a

150
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,580
presentation from the sabine on the

151
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,680
remaining issues but i discussed with

152
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,479
her yesterday they're very few so we are

153
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,850
very hopeful that this is basically done

154
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,890
now i think there are just some typos

155
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,100
and small issues that Sabine's gonna fix

156
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,840
and then we can kick the new version out

157
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,600
of the working group so that's done and

158
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,400
actually I'm almost the same status as

159
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,200
the SSD drop Richard uploaded a new

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,669
version and we will know I have no

161
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,440
presentation on this today because

162
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,859
basically last time we already greet

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,710
it's pretty much done and so just for

164
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,270
from a process perspective once yeah as

165
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,310
soon as possible issue issue another

166
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,349
working class because Richard posted in

167
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,210
your version so people have two weeks to

168
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,950
comment on it but I don't expect

169
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,810
anything there and we certainly don't

170
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,460
need any reviewers for that second

171
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,550
working class

172
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,810
we've done all of that and so that means

173
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,699
for other working room items are

174
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,150
remaining and we have presentations on

175
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:57,190
each of these and the focus is basically

176
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,099
what's missing for working plus call and

177
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,210
I have just a short summary but this is

178
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,819
basically what has reset already

179
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,419
cross-domain is on rise G evaluation

180
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,720
cost calendar is pretty much done I just

181
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:13,180
said that MSS is the same we will not

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,250
have a presentation but basically it's

183
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,870
we're gonna have a second working class

184
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,460
call um CD on FCI

185
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,070
we had a meeting yesterday also with all

186
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,349
the authors and I personally think being

187
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,780
a co-author with my chair had off this

188
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:30,669
is very mature and if you look at it I

189
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,469
think it's already 40 pages lots of code

190
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:35,740
examples Jason exams it should be good

191
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,020
one thing that I think came up to my

192
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,449
mind yesterday is it went once we do a

193
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,520
working blast call on this document we

194
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,400
should also inform the CDN I working

195
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,289
group and because remember this was

196
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,179
kicked from the CDN working a co-working

197
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,820
CNI working group to our working group

198
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,590
in theory we are just doing the

199
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,960
transport protocol and the SI denies

200
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,580
semantics have not changed right so the

201
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,900
JSON objects specified we do

202
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,659
specifically discuss it with the

203
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,729
co-authors yesterday there is RFC 8 zero

204
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:05,949
zero eight which I'm a co-author and

205
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,599
that has been finished and that defines

206
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,039
the JSON format and we're not touching

207
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,800
that so we're just transporting that

208
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,909
format so in theory the CDN I working

209
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,740
group should have not have a problem

210
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:18,370
with it but just to be fair we're gonna

211
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,110
kick it inform them and and you know I'm

212
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,520
saying always saying in theory you never

213
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,229
know maybe they have some comments and

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,099
we need to address them we will have to

215
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:29,050
see and write and this is the remaining

216
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,000
documents we have performance metrics

217
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,709
where I am yeah we have to see today

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,049
doing Richards presentation how close it

219
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,119
is to working plus call and I talked to

220
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,338
you Richard yesterday unified properties

221
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,399
and path vector remember these go as a

222
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,169
bundle because their dependencies and I

223
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,640
think Pat vector is more mature than

224
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,819
unified properties but Richard will

225
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,709
present on that but let's see again our

226
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:55,390
question as chairs is how close to

227
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:57,459
working class call um yeah that so

228
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,170
that's that's our quick summary on on

229
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:05,229
the status are there any other

230
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:08,259
comments the other business okay if not

231
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:12,399
Vijay you want to show you a chi you're

232
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:15,910
the first speaker so please get yourself

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,589
situated on Medeco and for those of you

234
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:23,618
that came in late and having signed the

235
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:25,299
blue sheets please do so that's that I

236
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:32,859
think we can start with highs

237
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:38,169
presentation yes so that's the me Tyco

238
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:50,999
laptop over there I think the actors

239
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:50,999
started here say good

240
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,060
yes all I know is me deco is aware and

241
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:13,100
there's been an extension you should be

242
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:15,770
sure to request presentation okay hi if

243
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,760
you're listening can you maybe look on

244
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:25,760
your meet echo and requests permission

245
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,439
to start presentation yeah so that's

246
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:38,230
what I'm trying to find out where's it's

247
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:38,230
like oh no they're there

248
00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:27,579
Patman oh right no it's a Patrick

249
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:36,970
Turkish bath all right

250
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:40,870
chi can you start Lorenzo

251
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,579
can you coordinate to see if I can start

252
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,779
presenting otherwise we want to the next

253
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:58,089
one and come back to kinda end yes yeah

254
00:11:49,779 --> 00:12:01,920
just watching my okay Chi can you click

255
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:06,010
on the mic but yeah I think I'm like

256
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,390
that's good yeah okay so we don't see

257
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,420
you but we hear you I think that's good

258
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,370
enough yeah and so we can hear you and

259
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,349
just go ahead and say next slide and

260
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,149
then we will move to the next slide yeah

261
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,519
sure thanks

262
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,860
so good morning everyone today I'm going

263
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:29,290
to give some updates of the past factor

264
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:31,630
extension so next type is so this page

265
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,640
basically gives an overview of the

266
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:37,029
updates we have made in the last two

267
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:40,329
revisions basically since last Society

268
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:45,430
meeting we have pumped two versions so

269
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:49,149
in the 0-7 version we've found eyes the

270
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:52,449
specification and also made some changes

271
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:54,399
to the references regarding the

272
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:56,500
specifications we revert to the cost

273
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,740
type design back to the one we used in

274
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,319
0-5 and we add a new article billion

275
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,910
request field to negotiated properties

276
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:06,910
and we also have the new property to

277
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,750
support some use cases other than cocoa

278
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,350
scheduling

279
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,900
and in the latest revision we focus more

280
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:18,610
on the clarification of some concepts

281
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:24,069
and also ways more use cases so next

282
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,570
slide please so this page summarize the

283
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,690
changes we made to the crosstab design

284
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:33,130
so in 0-5 we'll use array as a cost mode

285
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:35,230
and any path as cost metric in 0-5 is

286
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:38,200
changed slightly different where path

287
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,850
vector used as the Coast mode and we

288
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,790
only include one property for the

289
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,980
cosmetic and since they're all seven we

290
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,380
change back to the one we use the zero

291
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,620
file basically this cost I better

292
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:54,400
conforms to the auto cost type design

293
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,230
principle where the mode represents the

294
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,290
interpretation of the value and the

295
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:08,620
metric means the semantics so next step

296
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:11,770
is we also clarify the property

297
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,589
negotiation process in the for the past

298
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,439
factor in 0-5 público is handled by the

299
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:20,850
unified property back extension

300
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:24,070
basically in individual curry and in 0-6

301
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:28,630
we have merged the two responses into a

302
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:30,670
single one so but we only left one

303
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,490
property to be curried and it is encoded

304
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,800
as a cosmetic and since there are seven

305
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,320
we have introduced the following

306
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,640
mechanisms first available properties

307
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,520
are lost in the IRD entry capability and

308
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,069
the client must submit selecting the

309
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,050
properties in the curry and basically

310
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,720
this process mimics the negotiation

311
00:14:50,050 --> 00:15:02,079
process of cost types so in the next

312
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:04,150
page we give an example of what the

313
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:09,070
changes look like so on the left hand

314
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:11,850
side in the article abilities we have a

315
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:16,060
new capability called any properties and

316
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:21,250
it is defined as an array of party names

317
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:24,729
for the any domain ending the and

318
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:30,670
right hand side we give we add a new

319
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:33,310
field to the filter that is submitted by

320
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,060
a client which is also named any

321
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,510
properties and it is an array of

322
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:47,979
selective properties by the clients

323
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:52,180
so let's page please we have also

324
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:57,250
introduced a new property should in the

325
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:00,930
row 7 basically it is it is called

326
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,860
persistent entity it is an array of any

327
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,010
identifiers that are persisting the

328
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,430
scope of an out of server so when it is

329
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,800
not present we it is truly as an empty

330
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,329
list so the motivation for this new

331
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,770
product is allows clients to call refer

332
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,860
the information related to energy is

333
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,020
discovered by pass factor and in enables

334
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:29,710
application such as in network cash

335
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:32,260
panning and it and in contrast any which

336
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:35,560
is dynamically generated and specific to

337
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,500
the correct procedure entities or can be

338
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,599
used to create related properties in

339
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,310
another unified problem map or some

340
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,460
other auto resources so in the next page

341
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,459
please

342
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,020
and in this page we give an example of

343
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:07,089
how the persistent entity works

344
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:10,150
first the the united energy must be

345
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:13,540
exported by another unit by problem map

346
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:16,510
for example we use the domain called

347
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:19,119
HTTP proxy here this process is not

348
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:23,290
formally registered but so we only use

349
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:27,939
it for this example and in the unified

350
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,129
property map we claim that this unifier

351
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,420
protein map can provide property is

352
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:38,610
called price for this HT proxy where the

353
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:45,490
price means for example dollars per

354
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:49,780
gigabyte stored on the proxy and then

355
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,140
this resource should be used by a path

356
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:58,110
vector resource to indicate that this

357
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:04,000
entity is exported from this from the

358
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:07,540
used from the property map in here in

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,600
the users communities and then in the

360
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:15,540
any properties the server came along

361
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,280
persistent entities as available

362
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,280
property so in the next page

363
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,779
so in the next page we give an example

364
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,960
of what the persistent intense returns

365
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:43,599
so it returns an entity identifier of

366
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:45,909
the HTTP proxy domain so here we

367
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,749
basically still using the IP address for

368
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:55,419
this entity identifier but it could be

369
00:18:49,749 --> 00:19:00,940
for example a domain name awesome or a

370
00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:04,779
host name so basically this is a new

371
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:07,590
newly introduced used property so in the

372
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,590
next page

373
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:32,479
go ahead guy in the next page sorry I

374
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:36,680
think the connection is temporarily lost

375
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,560
so so that if this page gives an

376
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:47,270
overview of the clarification text we

377
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:49,639
have made to the draft in the 0-7 we the

378
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,110
first range in the three sections you

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,450
should actually overview and motivation

380
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,979
basically is build around the

381
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,630
requirement of the pass vector design

382
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,460
and how the extension interesting

383
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,250
requirements and also the co flow use

384
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:05,980
case and the since the in the latest

385
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,330
revision we try to clarify the

386
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,760
importance of transportation in two

387
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:14,750
aspects so first it can be used to

388
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,640
support new usage scenarios and also it

389
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,620
provides fundamentally different

390
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,680
information between the correlation of

391
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,540
natural path and the base protocol

392
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,560
provides preferences of literal past

393
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,790
I think this better clarifies the

394
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,060
necessity of the pass vector extension

395
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,889
and in the overview section we give a

396
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:37,879
top-down exploration of the design space

397
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:41,930
and design TCM justifications so here

398
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,550
are three most critical issues for

399
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,580
example why do we encode the information

400
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,680
in a single message basically it is for

401
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,740
like server skillopedia or other

402
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,270
customers and we also give some other

403
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,270
details and also we

404
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:40,100
cai-you there I think we lost him

405
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:43,280
kai hmm mantra - Kai yeah so since the

406
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,639
SIA I mean he would he was mostly done

407
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm looking at Wawa

408
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,670
not mostly yeah he sounds like he can

409
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,889
hear us

410
00:21:51,670 --> 00:22:01,250
hello there is back right okay but kaya

411
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,870
I also would like to remind you to speed

412
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,300
up a little because we have a couple

413
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,520
more presentations today so maybe you

414
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,860
can go over the remaining slides a bit

415
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:16,220
quicker also yeah sure of course

416
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:21,020
five minutes okay so in the next page we

417
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:23,690
basically fix a issue which is in the

418
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:27,680
latest sec trapped it uses a different

419
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,300
mechanism as we we mentioned in the past

420
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,150
back to extension so basically we fix

421
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,370
the issue with a new concept called

422
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,170
power resource ID so this power source

423
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:39,370
on is also used in 0-7 version but not

424
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,050
defined

425
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:47,449
individually so basically we need some

426
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:51,350
clarification so in the next slide we we

427
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,450
we describe the two usages of the past

428
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,179
resource I power resource ID so it is

429
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,340
used in the pass filter with response to

430
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,010
indicate the resource redundancy and in

431
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,230
the sec update stream to the multiplex

432
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:07,129
updates for the two resources we turn by

433
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:09,710
the pass factor so in the next two

434
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,320
slides we basically give example of the

435
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:18,640
power resource ID so maybe we can just

436
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,639
skip the examples and

437
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,770
so that in the next time we basically

438
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:29,990
talk about the compatibility issue is

439
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:33,110
cost can endure in the there are several

440
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:36,740
version the integration with cost Canada

441
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,540
slept as discussion basically the

442
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,180
conclusion is in the you left as a

443
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,580
future requirement so in the latest

444
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:47,990
revision we looked back to a question

445
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,850
and and I think even with the current

446
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,650
design the cost Canada extension can be

447
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,840
used directing with the pass back to

448
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,870
extinction when it's one requirement

449
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,360
that the same if the same extra natural

450
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,129
element in different time intervals ways

451
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,169
different properties must be treated as

452
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:09,280
different areas and if if also

453
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,280
reinforces this requirement

454
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:34,889
okay looks like we lost you again

455
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:39,379
because we can't hear you Richard

456
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:44,639
if you are aware of this can you just

457
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:48,740
write okay we went to the conclusion

458
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:48,740
slide can you can you try one more time

459
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:55,649
well it doesn't seem to work but I mean

460
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,830
we can see the conclusions here and

461
00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:00,119
maybe that's a good time to open the

462
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,879
discussion or maybe ask the other

463
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:07,740
co-authors who are here so I see what I

464
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,259
read from this is this is you did a lot

465
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,970
of work and you move this forward and

466
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,419
you don't have any outstanding issues

467
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,330
anymore

468
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:17,879
correct Richard there are no any yeah

469
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,350
really and so do only one thing is

470
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:21,689
falling and I think it will only change

471
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,399
which is not make is for the final

472
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,409
version of SSC which should we just

473
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,539
upload a few days ago I'm willing to the

474
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,210
name from clan ID because stop stream ID

475
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:32,399
so it's an editorial thing that's yes

476
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,409
there is about nine content writing

477
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,820
that's only change okay but actually I

478
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,409
would say for that we don't even need a

479
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,029
new version we do that after the working

480
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,639
class caught right if there's just a

481
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,350
name change in SSC just as long as you

482
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:48,418
have it on your you don't forget about

483
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,769
it so the other question is we agreed

484
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,220
that we would move these two together

485
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:54,960
path vector and unified properties and

486
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,999
but Richard you're more the expert you

487
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,470
shall we go for a working class call on

488
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,629
this one and say it's done and then wait

489
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,419
for unified properties or shall we wait

490
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:05,340
I mean yeah I think we promise you to

491
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,049
wait until we see the unified property

492
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,629
and then we can make a decision to see -

493
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:11,129
we was homeless I mean you mean - during

494
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:13,049
today's session we cannot go into the -

495
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:16,498
okay let's postpone it for a couple of

496
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:19,499
minutes okay right so the only other

497
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:22,230
comment which I want to make is right

498
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:24,570
now I think I and I we had a quite a

499
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,669
long discussion I think like a two days

500
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,859
ago and because Ryan out of Cass factor

501
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:31,350
there's one use case about I think I

502
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:33,119
also talked to something as well and

503
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,020
because there's a one major yields kick

504
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,909
would you right already

505
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,520
instead of getting fully deployed by the

506
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,830
DoD by like for bear lodge I will see

507
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,170
our elk you see and there's some like

508
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,820
three years cases and time blog and

509
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,590
several ones and which potentially I

510
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,139
think he talked about integration with a

511
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,240
cost calendar that's probably related so

512
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,550
I don't recommend at all we make a

513
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,010
change this document really integrated

514
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,510
but I do recommend that the ulcers and

515
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,370
including hikes I mean out there and

516
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,290
also start being cost come to take a

517
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,639
look see if we would potentially we

518
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,170
might even like a low-hanging fruit just

519
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,820
email address very quickly I believe

520
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,530
they can be addressing the same thing I

521
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,210
agree with all that but maybe they can

522
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,860
also do that doing a working blast call

523
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,840
yes I believe so I'm just trying to

524
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,600
speed up the process not for every small

525
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,250
issue yeah so maybe when we start the

526
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,230
working group last call officially on

527
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,760
the list once we do that you can remind

528
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,590
the other cost calendar co-author

529
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,540
authors and stuff to check for these

530
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,370
kinds of things so just to make sure

531
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,040
because cost calendar has been through

532
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:31,050
the wgl see so there's no impact on cost

533
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,879
calendar itself corrected no supposedly

534
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,889
not and basically cost cannot be

535
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,540
stabilized at Hayes and the only use

536
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,559
case is I was a special tortured by a

537
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,450
couple essentially CERN and BOE

538
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,920
Department energy people see that you

539
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,630
check it see if it can be really use or

540
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,530
not okay sounds good

541
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:52,050
so then we come back to W DLC after

542
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,670
impact properties correct yeah we do

543
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,928
that discussion afterwards but it

544
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,530
generally to summarize also for the

545
00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:00,179
notes our understanding now is that all

546
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,309
design decisions and technical issues

547
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:06,000
have been resolved lots of work only

548
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:07,470
super minor editorial issues and some

549
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,059
clarifications with other draft or

550
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,830
authors that they can make them work in

551
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,200
class cause it's done from our

552
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,639
perspective but let's wait because it

553
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,220
depends on unified properties how we

554
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,850
move forward okay cool then Richard

555
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,850
Europe next

556
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:31,630
yeah and this I used I hope that it's a

557
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,820
real work so therefore I can really

558
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:39,040
speak and without being corrupted ok

559
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:42,040
it's performance magic finest light I

560
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:47,920
think upload a couple I upload couple

561
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,750
versions no way Richard your uploaded

562
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:54,250
versions on short notice before the

563
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:57,280
meeting and I think it happened I did

564
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:04,630
make it right you can see that is like a

565
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:08,200
final version from go down go down yeah

566
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,870
final final swipes yeah I give a title

567
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,880
change so if you keep the title the same

568
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,280
it'll just keep on upload you know makes

569
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,570
sense yeah so that's why I suggested

570
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,020
putting the version number in your

571
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:23,290
sights

572
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:25,120
yeah ok so let me get it started I'll

573
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,720
talk about auto performance and metrics

574
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,560
and it's version 7 and here is least of

575
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,820
our callers and we indeed actually have

576
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,490
quite some extensive extensive

577
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,439
discussions in the last couple of days

578
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,680
and I think even today we're gonna talk

579
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,380
to some experts from IPPF I believe

580
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,350
let's see let me talk about ok and here

581
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:51,310
is outline of changes we made in this

582
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:54,399
file in his most recent abortion oh ok

583
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,260
so and for today and mostly I'll talk

584
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,480
about out is we have made from zero six

585
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,160
two zero seven and I do want to talk

586
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,690
about one remaining issue I cannot

587
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,180
really remain issues means mainly a

588
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,530
single remaining issue which we want to

589
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,760
engage the homework you group we're four

590
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,889
can discuss hopefully we can make a

591
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,260
final decision I never talk about plan

592
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,170
for next at depends on a discussion on

593
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:20,890
the working group discussion item

594
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:24,280
okay should I come to oh okay you can

595
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:27,460
try really good I can and I like this

596
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,180
yeah that's sort like I cannot I don't

597
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,250
believe so

598
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:35,760
okay your bus so and here is the really

599
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,860
overview over the updates we have made

600
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:44,790
from watching six who version seven oh

601
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:47,280
it works now oh so basically and we have

602
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:50,040
made two types of changes and type

603
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,570
number one is we indeed make quite a lot

604
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,100
of structural changes not really content

605
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,290
because with your dad this is better at

606
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,820
the clarified idea and in particularly

607
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:59,760
for people who can really read I know

608
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,919
it's like be small and a media strategy

609
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,110
it's actually true from there and left

610
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,530
hand side is portion six right hand side

611
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:11,490
a section it's about seven let you

612
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:13,470
explosion so what we did was essentially

613
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,360
the operations the challenges and so on

614
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,830
we put our very beginning as up front

615
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,899
and beginning to talk about all the

616
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,370
change and so on and they could rely

617
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,360
less probably too much diversion and

618
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,770
follow reader

619
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,479
so therefore fourth annual worship we

620
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,150
move it into the new version in your

621
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,560
section called section four and we

622
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,020
rename the called Operation Torch

623
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:35,730
operational considerations surfer that's

624
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,740
one major change from here and to here

625
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,750
and the second immediate structural

626
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,310
change is we indeed make a lot of

627
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,900
structure changes on section two which

628
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,879
is essentially bulk apart main technical

629
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,560
part of these drafts and we're mostly

630
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,630
trying to define the performance metrics

631
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,510
and you know you know in a different

632
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,820
structure so which actually the main

633
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,770
focus of today's discussion of course we

634
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,750
also made a lot of small tax changes as

635
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,639
well and which I will not want to go to

636
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:03,360
the details ok hangar the next slide

637
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:07,620
please so here is let me talk about why

638
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,540
we make it a structure changes for from

639
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,729
watching from version six to version 7

640
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,560
and left hand side is the basic

641
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,570
structure for every performance metric

642
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,429
we define for each auto performance

643
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,399
metric assume you can see that with if I

644
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:23,300
metric name description and method of

645
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,350
measurement or calculation and units and

646
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,340
marianum points with potential

647
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,669
measurement

648
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,020
domains and timing and use and

649
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,630
applications so basically this I be

650
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,780
mostly it comes from template of the I

651
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,850
ppm and but on the other hand and if you

652
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,530
look at essentially based protocol of

653
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:44,040
auto which is RFC seventy to eighty five

654
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:45,930
and here is the cost metrics registry

655
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,690
part a section part of that based on

656
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,480
protocol and it says that if you define

657
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,179
and

658
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,679
this Auto cosmetic registry and you must

659
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:56,740
really provide the following information

660
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,690
number one was identifier and number two

661
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,220
and wasn't innocent man takes and you

662
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,960
can semantics really talk about

663
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,630
basically without being utilized and

664
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,309
document and lower value is better and

665
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,870
what's the measurement unit and so on

666
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:10,178
and then to talk about security

667
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:12,909
considerations let's be structure of

668
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:16,030
alcohol essential structure and here is

669
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,260
a structure of the I ppm and therefore

670
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,178
actual ulcers have quite a lot of

671
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,679
discussions even we decide that's

672
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:23,080
essential day they are really out who

673
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,610
performs matrix we promptly even totally

674
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,799
restructured really follow the also

675
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,949
seventy to eighty five structure so next

676
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,929
slides peace so this is essentially the

677
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,460
new structure of definition for you to

678
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,559
perform symmetric with you find it for

679
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,540
auto and from version six to version

680
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:39,820
seven here's version six just still show

681
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,320
here over there and here's a new one for

682
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,899
watch and said you can see that there

683
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,220
are several changes number one years and

684
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,710
follow all the one and we don't have

685
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,929
example like symmetric identifiers and

686
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,730
here we add a new a new section called a

687
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,200
metric identify essential to really to

688
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,870
be consistent because we really require

689
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,429
a identify and then what do we do is we

690
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,989
talk about in Tennessee men text so

691
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:01,570
therefore basically essentially mobile

692
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,010
the description and and unit of

693
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,720
representation and more including

694
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,610
Tennessee semantics because that turns

695
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,010
out to be really intensive antics and

696
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:11,230
then of course we move up the use and

697
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,940
applications and then what we did it was

698
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,129
we really move a lot essential other

699
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,230
logs and candido's into Central American

700
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:18,100
solutions we add all those divas over

701
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,659
there so a little bit of restructure

702
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,118
repealed and that's essentially the

703
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,399
combination over the past also structure

704
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,540
and verses a senior I ppm and we were

705
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,429
pretty happy about it but of course

706
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,550
we're more than happy it really take any

707
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,010
comment or suggestion on this part next

708
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,389
slide please

709
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,560
so basically here is letting you really

710
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,300
go over a little bit about the

711
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,609
performance metrics we finalized and we

712
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,320
define in this document and here you can

713
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,810
see that essentially can be grouped into

714
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,359
a circle one two three four and four

715
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,219
categories and category on is mostly

716
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,429
about the delays and one lady L a

717
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,239
round-trip delay and packet delay

718
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,470
variations sometime in the called the

719
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,879
cheater so therefore if you have feel

720
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,859
strongly that we could call the cheater

721
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,240
we recall the GTR is a moment and we'll

722
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:00,910
follow I ppm we call a buckle

723
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,680
deliberation and we have hub count and

724
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,089
you have packet loss and you

725
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,200
throughput the maximum user abandon

726
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,700
where's the rest of your banner is

727
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,359
essentially it can sail they essentially

728
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,740
classified into four types and here is

729
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,750
let me really clarify on the month we

730
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,430
really clarified it we talked about it's

731
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,750
kind of essential it delays it's a

732
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,569
single decent number conforming to

733
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,820
section 605 RFC seventy to eighty nine I

734
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:25,930
believe we were using seventy one fifty

735
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,730
nine and I believe now as 8250 no I has

736
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,609
to replace seventy-five 59 so therefore

737
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,260
we change continual version and we

738
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,980
probably we added a must be in

739
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:38,140
non-negative number and unit must be

740
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,670
millisecond for example and Hopkin is

741
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,580
easy in the way we indicate the number

742
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,290
must be integer and negative and packet

743
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,180
loss essentially its percentage and

744
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,550
rather represent and someone if you know

745
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,200
the one change is now we you to see the

746
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,820
person thing it must be integer we

747
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,350
remove it because essentially we look at

748
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,250
some examples we last no integers will

749
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,540
be not good enough

750
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,550
so therefore basically changing to be

751
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,140
must be non-negative is longer integral

752
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,110
over there half can of course you must

753
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,160
be integer and bandwidth again between

754
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,440
two 8259

755
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,379
and number must be non-negative and unit

756
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,900
is a megabits per second and i do want

757
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,340
to mention a couple issues and which i

758
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,910
think if a people want to comment and

759
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:18,070
will be more than welcome to to give a

760
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,560
comment for example one suggestion these

761
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,810
cars among all authors is we don't adopt

762
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:28,029
even truly and but suggested is for

763
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:30,160
example can we use a number so basically

764
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,600
for example if you go to a boy actuallyI

765
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,029
even surely there's a number two how to

766
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,580
cut an eight knot and number for example

767
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,530
and imagine for example be widest useful

768
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,870
for the use case is one way deal a

769
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,220
round-trip time and so on often time you

770
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,290
can see if you look disconnected what's

771
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,060
the delay it's a really giant number it

772
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,940
makes them a possible value or whatever

773
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,049
to truly whatever 100 power and so on or

774
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,170
maybe even toll it should really

775
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,450
infinity suppose it is it is hunt

776
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,800
disconnected so some also feel very

777
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,480
strongly that we should really say

778
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,740
essentially it's a member to be not a

779
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,350
number essentially called positive

780
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,479
infinity or some others no no no that's

781
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,279
too complex and as a lot of passing

782
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,560
complex and so on so called a kernel

783
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,840
version and and we did not really take

784
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,230
this a suggestion but if you feel

785
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,660
strongly about people from i ppm and if

786
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,039
you're strongly or whatever

787
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,379
and probably won't we won't hear your

788
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,180
opinion and second the second accurate

789
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,059
thing also debated quite a lot or

790
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,038
attributes castle our cursor is right

791
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,990
now essentially is we pick a fixed unit

792
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:30,000
for example here it will pick a

793
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,430
millisecond here we pick a megabits per

794
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,750
second they are they might be slightly

795
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,240
not a future-proof

796
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,349
for example eventually for example the

797
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,390
base van der will no longer be a

798
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:40,650
megabits per second and up for example

799
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,118
eventually it goes like every seems like

800
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,099
it beats per second even till the

801
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,589
numbers become always obvious very lot

802
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,230
for example I mean a more like 1000 so

803
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:50,940
the suggestion is why don't you focus on

804
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,289
for making like a megabits per second

805
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,819
and kilobits per second K bits per

806
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:55,559
second key VP per second and so on

807
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:58,740
eventually be computer for maybe you

808
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,780
easy to read and so on and latency also

809
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,359
become millisecond and second and so on

810
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,859
and the eventual decision is no let's

811
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,420
pick a single while and it's actually

812
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,950
always that single number and you need

813
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,049
to be defined by the protocol and I will

814
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,390
define a pilot by it by pile of little

815
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:14,849
payload itself so those are two

816
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,529
suggestions and we do not I take I think

817
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:19,099
there are minor but with you or more

818
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,900
than happy to take any working group

819
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:24,720
opinions should I wait here for comment

820
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,539
yeah no we can wait I mean I see also

821
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,578
Ellis in the room maybe here's some

822
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:33,000
comments he wants to make or other

823
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,740
people I just for my perspective is

824
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,869
cherries and we wanted to get

825
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,660
clarification from the experts in the

826
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:42,690
ITF that the metrics we are proposing

827
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,609
here are not controversial right yes and

828
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,069
we have maybe just to reiterate why they

829
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:50,549
could be controversial and Alto is not

830
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:52,288
supposed to be used on and you know on a

831
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:54,690
on your short interval but only

832
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:56,490
periodically so all the values you're

833
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,680
proposing here would be averages and

834
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,689
something alright so the semantics might

835
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,490
not be hundred percent clear and that's

836
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,490
why we want a clarification but if the

837
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:08,069
IDF experts agree that this is something

838
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,689
we can do and we are it makes sense I

839
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:11,788
mean surely these values are useful

840
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,000
right there are many use cases where you

841
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:16,799
could use these where you where will be

842
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,980
very beneficial to applications if they

843
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:21,720
could get these values via Alto I mean

844
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,029
from the top of my head I can imagine 20

845
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,270
use cases why would be useful yes so for

846
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:29,000
us it's more another process the

847
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,490
expertise issue or

848
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,410
I ATF general guideline issue okay yeah

849
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,700
okay great come right as a chair

850
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,700
speaking of the chair

851
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:45,830
hi I'm Mel Morton I'm not a chair for AI

852
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,598
ppm but I'm trying to catch up with this

853
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,190
quickly I got a junk mail this morning

854
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,990
yeah we didn't like that didn't manage

855
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,460
to show up at the right time great

856
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:54,589
alright let me first ask are these

857
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:59,060
active measurements and that they

858
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:01,070
generate synthetic traffic and they will

859
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,720
talk about that basically just a moment

860
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,000
a semantics would be define essentially

861
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,740
be defined conveyed by the because also

862
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,630
essentially can be classified customized

863
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,819
and essential I want go to go to that

864
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,890
part of details and pork shoulder and

865
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,930
the semantics could be essentially our

866
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,640
show the actual for example the average

867
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,470
number and could come from the arrival

868
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,330
results or could come for example packet

869
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,279
appear and to measure of examples report

870
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,810
and so on and it could come essentially

871
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,670
for exam some can marry measurements so

872
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:34,599
may not get me may be active or may be

873
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:39,260
passive okay so all the all the I ppm

874
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:43,640
metric references are strictly you know

875
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,500
according to RFC 77 99 they're active

876
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,970
methods of measurement yeah yeah and

877
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,520
because the metric definitions take

878
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:56,390
advantage of that we also call them

879
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,359
active metrics correct when you talk

880
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:03,700
about doing something else like passive

881
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:06,259
or the hybrid categories that we defined

882
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,720
you know that's that's going to be it's

883
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,270
going to be a little different for the

884
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,270
metric definitions then so there's you

885
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:16,400
know some forms of mismatch emerging in

886
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,310
the you know in going beyond the active

887
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,619
synthetic measurement traffic can you

888
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,730
hold out yeah I think for common I'll go

889
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:24,710
to that apart and if they say that

890
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,630
you'll see that for example if I mean

891
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,349
reactive very quickly it would be for

892
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,330
example right now

893
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,770
for example even in one project where

894
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,480
were deploying a system is right now for

895
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,759
example one trend is now you even given

896
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,349
it's not activity I don't if you called

897
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,060
active or passive for example right now

898
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:40,070
with a lot of Sdn for examples which is

899
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,420
nowadays is you can even do measurements

900
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,619
passively by monitor you know traffic is

901
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,829
you don't really inject because I'm a

902
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:48,599
probing also or a pure code not very

903
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:50,099
much to tell even like a right on your

904
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,630
capability is therefore I don't even

905
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,980
call active or passive basically we can

906
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,569
collect those numbers and try to reserve

907
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,950
for example I mean reportable for

908
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:59,880
example I think that's probably really

909
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:02,390
polar boundary a little bit well I think

910
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,190
we've got the full text on me described

911
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,740
seven twenty seventy seven ninety-nine

912
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,630
so I think that's what I'd suggest that

913
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,939
you take a look at that sherlyn that'll

914
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,990
help the absolute like determining the

915
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,010
applicability of the IP PM metrics that

916
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,709
we've written yes

917
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:21,390
now you yeah I'm gonna sure I ppm in a

918
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,760
slice and week I'm gonna discuss with

919
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,348
you guys and how we want to build on

920
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,380
here but we don't want what you'll say

921
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:31,250
but this moment and I think yeah okay so

922
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:35,640
you were saying the other thing I'm I'm

923
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:39,690
interested in is that I see you've got a

924
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,240
registry going here yes we do and we're

925
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,670
also about to finish up for registry

926
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,250
yeah yeah yeah the IP PME an issue or an

927
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:50,789
issue or educational content but also

928
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:53,190
the all the registry design and you know

929
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:55,680
this took way too long but that means

930
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,809
that it had lots and lots of input and

931
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,788
it supposedly covers both active and

932
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,549
passive measurements derived in

933
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:05,099
different parts of the IETF people are

934
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:07,319
already using it and I mean as we

935
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,759
approach the last call that was some of

936
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:12,359
the good surprises you know people are

937
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:14,009
out there basically using the registry

938
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:16,730
and had some feedback on that I'll show

939
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:18,690
you I'm not sure yours yeah so you're

940
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,569
imagine there's ways to put these things

941
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,980
together but you know obviously we're

942
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:27,900
going to go ahead with the registry that

943
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:30,029
we planned and and and it's it's got a

944
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:35,849
lots of detail in there on some active

945
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:37,349
massive networks definitely so sorry

946
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:41,460
Mary just for my understanding you can

947
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:44,160
you can go my understanding is that our

948
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,579
ultra performance metrics document will

949
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,799
refer to metrics you have been defining

950
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:52,380
so the semantics should be then Chris

951
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:54,089
who cleared this semantic I want to go

952
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,690
data part changes well I don't want to

953
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:59,490
show that also do

954
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:02,319
so one one wrinkle on that young is that

955
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:05,368
the IP performance metrics of

956
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:10,058
specifications deliberately left

957
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:12,670
parameters input factors available and

958
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:16,690
by changing those input factors you can

959
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:20,380
get very different measurements in the

960
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,849
end the purpose of the registry in our

961
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,880
mine the performance metrics registry

962
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,410
was to narrow those down a bit where we

963
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,329
could there are certain runtime

964
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,828
parameters that you shouldn't nail down

965
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:32,859
like the source address and destination

966
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:34,780
address obviously but the but others

967
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:37,930
check your path example periodical

968
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,819
publish all those those are the kinds of

969
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,368
things that you know in order to get

970
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:45,400
comparable results that's our goal we

971
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:47,859
nailed a lot of the flexibility of the

972
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,280
original IP PM metrics down so it really

973
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:53,440
sounds as though in some sense this

974
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,990
should be referring to metrics that go

975
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,559
into the registry as opposed to the

976
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:15,160
broad IP PM definitions if you want to

977
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:16,630
get comparable results for a long time

978
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,609
we were not sure how to move this ahead

979
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,770
so we thank you for being here not for

980
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:23,558
me this was very useful yes absolutely

981
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:28,079
right I'm gonna go that pop you won't

982
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,079
give a quick comment if I go that part

983
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,160
don't understand how this like finally

984
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,839
it would work because they young you

985
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,779
said this is really useful metrics but

986
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:39,670
those metrics are only useful if you

987
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,069
actually have data that is current right

988
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:45,069
like ideally you would need to know what

989
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:47,710
is my jitter right now right because

990
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:50,950
these values can change so what's the

991
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:53,140
what's the intend or the idea here about

992
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,240
like when you would actually measure

993
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,549
those data or like how static other data

994
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,240
how often is oh okay I think the short

995
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,349
answer is appalling

996
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,439
of course would you find a product short

997
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:04,390
also is the you can use kiss its people

998
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,520
initially Retriever for example from

999
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,170
custom app or any coupon car service and

1000
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,640
then subscribe for example using

1001
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,200
see sort of what can get pushed to

1002
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,879
whatever interval he really is subscribe

1003
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,290
to it for example it could be pushed I

1004
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,849
know how much we'll get a coach back

1005
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,859
from Ikea basically the potential it

1006
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:19,780
could be pushes by essentially like a

1007
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,160
SSC essentially probably can in some

1008
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,140
kind of real time of course we could

1009
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,390
really also for exactly the I believe a

1010
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,879
for example the I would I show you're

1011
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,500
like stop all Sprint and AT&T show their

1012
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,790
performance numbers typically Abbott

1013
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:36,280
every 15 minutes for example my

1014
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,690
throughput will very correct right for

1015
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,460
some for examples report available

1016
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:41,920
banner is probably called week on but a

1017
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,780
problem area latency promise I'm like a

1018
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,160
propagation delay problem object unless

1019
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,900
for example there's some kind of for

1020
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,279
example link failure and you do

1021
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:55,750
rerouting so what other case you

1022
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:56,920
probably pushed not like once we are not

1023
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,180
applying for that because I'm if you

1024
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,700
really do that it we cannot prevent it

1025
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:04,868
by the intention is much a longer time

1026
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:07,240
scale so I think actually all of these

1027
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:09,460
use all of these metrics are useful in

1028
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:13,540
such a timeframe like 50 minutes or more

1029
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,700
and and for and more important is that

1030
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,549
you actually make clear what you mean in

1031
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,439
the draft sure because I always

1032
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:21,460
automatic is you mean you do a fresh

1033
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,700
measurement and that's one of your

1034
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:27,099
report but that's not what you're doing

1035
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,779
so instead of maybe you should want even

1036
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:30,309
to rename some of the metrics because

1037
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:34,299
the names are used in this measurement

1038
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:36,280
world this way and and what you were add

1039
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:37,990
up in some cases you might actually get

1040
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,460
setec well yes right you measure your

1041
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,500
hop count once and then you know the

1042
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,510
topology and you will never ever we ever

1043
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,220
like this or somebody configures at once

1044
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:55,240
and it this there right yeah so hop

1045
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:57,549
count is not critical values like might

1046
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,899
change more dynamically if you ask for

1047
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:00,490
these various you just don't know what

1048
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,319
you have to expect and if you don't know

1049
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,779
what to expect if you don't know how

1050
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,400
people regenerated these values they are

1051
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,079
not useful at all because then you don't

1052
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,660
know how fresh the information is and

1053
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,339
what to do with it right and so about

1054
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,140
some of these metrics even so they would

1055
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:16,509
be super useful if you would have life

1056
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,859
information they might be completely not

1057
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,540
useful if you don't have the life

1058
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:20,950
information so it's actually little bit

1059
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,840
dangerous to put the minute

1060
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,310
but have we Oliver Mia we all agree we

1061
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:28,990
don't want we don't want Alto for

1062
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:31,750
license no so that's out of the question

1063
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,640
so the question is then are there value

1064
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,990
are their use cases where if it's not

1065
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,730
life information and you know how to

1066
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,430
person sure when this was measured if

1067
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:46,150
it's still useful for example your mom I

1068
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:48,370
think so I mean like what what you also

1069
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:51,070
could do is maybe I'm reduced to a

1070
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:53,170
minimum set right now and then you know

1071
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,700
and other metrics later on when you

1072
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,860
actually see there's a need for right

1073
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,830
sure sure yeah we do have several years

1074
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,940
cases and well yeah we can talk about

1075
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:05,380
that I want say which one do you mean

1076
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:07,360
what can we just I think this discussion

1077
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,580
has focused on the metrics maybe you go

1078
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,170
to the metrics like yeah so we can you

1079
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,150
just go I think I can I can tell where

1080
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,450
to stop so basically you can skip this

1081
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:18,100
part well actually yes

1082
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,919
so I could this is a really problem one

1083
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,560
important slide so basically is left

1084
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,570
hand side is the central metrics and we

1085
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,770
have defined and right hand side is a

1086
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,210
back pay pilot that's we did this

1087
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,920
caution issue which we really want

1088
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,600
discussed is the consistency and

1089
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,820
reusability and because basically what

1090
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,980
we want is reuse as much as possible and

1091
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,740
because in as much possible between auto

1092
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:42,930
and also a VPN and for people who don't

1093
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:46,180
know for example the FE p.m. and yet

1094
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:48,129
essentially is released of the kind of

1095
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,200
metrics you find about a ppm for example

1096
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:53,230
wrongful delay and you know I command

1097
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,509
interminable IP travel UDP for UDP using

1098
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,670
periodical traffic and here's a yellow

1099
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,650
exam pass save and you learned by PCP

1100
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:03,000
and so on so essentially all define

1101
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:06,370
being you know I ppm next sites please

1102
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,960
so basically what we want is this moment

1103
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,940
is when we need make a decision and it's

1104
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,530
really essentially

1105
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,030
final of your final wording and

1106
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,620
basically of water we understand a

1107
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:16,180
synergy discussion was always the call

1108
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,859
so I know we want really open discussion

1109
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,359
with I think Y is falling we've got the

1110
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,680
IP p.m. metrics and mostly alpha for

1111
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,390
infrastructure measurement man and

1112
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,830
management and take the underlying

1113
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:26,650
network technology be aware for example

1114
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:28,960
the PCP is UDP and just kind of central

1115
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,580
technology and so on an automatic is

1116
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,080
tended to be more apple application for

1117
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,339
example it should be really technology

1118
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,619
transparently you don't

1119
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:37,719
here's using IP if you MPLS and maybe

1120
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:39,960
using for example and okay essentially

1121
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:42,249
what about is user one somehow slightly

1122
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,819
technology mutual can alike at

1123
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:47,890
high-level abstractions can't go next so

1124
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:49,450
basically i for example some kind of

1125
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,999
like inspiration we talked about and

1126
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:54,460
sony is for example here is a data would

1127
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:55,988
be posted by sprint and they talk about

1128
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,809
all kind of Papa metrics for example

1129
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:01,269
talk about they are essential at the

1130
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:03,130
post of the average latency only on

1131
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:05,288
public website they would talk about for

1132
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,930
exam whatever they didn't say 35:56 mean

1133
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:09,579
the second units month and basically if

1134
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,618
you go from where to hear oftentimes to

1135
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:13,380
this very like a core screen and still

1136
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:16,329
very useful and they talk about was a

1137
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,930
typical loss rate and so on and next

1138
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:21,729
size please

1139
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:23,229
so yes because you kind of set this

1140
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:26,019
already you wants protocol independent

1141
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:27,549
but it can depend strongly what the

1142
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:29,008
results will be depending on what

1143
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:31,569
protocol used to measure languege

1144
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:33,249
actually which is a hold on one second

1145
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:34,538
I'll show you what a slightly also

1146
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:35,169
discussion will look like just just like

1147
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:38,920
a one minute

1148
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:43,180
oh okay oh please

1149
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,769
l Morton their IP performance metrics

1150
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:50,529
are aware that there's IP connectivity

1151
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:52,299
yes that's it okay yes so I kind of

1152
00:51:50,529 --> 00:51:54,039
disagree with your slides and the

1153
00:51:52,299 --> 00:51:56,079
categorization you're making this sure

1154
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,119
okay so basically you wanna say it's

1155
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,960
more generic I peel that's totally fine

1156
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:05,499
so basically here of course that's also

1157
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,029
spring resolved and you and all the

1158
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:08,379
people see what kind of SOA

1159
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:10,180
you can really figure out somehow if you

1160
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,890
want to pick up here pick a replicate

1161
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,169
and so on somehow you can use and so on

1162
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:16,299
next slide please so here is I'm just

1163
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,579
showing wrapped exam here is potential

1164
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:20,589
numbers posted by AT&T I believe and

1165
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:21,910
this is really from AT&T number you can

1166
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:23,828
see for example lately and say thirty

1167
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:27,009
point nine milliseconds and so on and

1168
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:28,059
here's for every peers and so on

1169
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,890
essential there are large school

1170
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:31,809
measurements and opposed by Union so so

1171
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:36,910
basically what do we one is this calico

1172
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:39,309
really hello hello if you really compare

1173
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:40,930
it really probably into for example for

1174
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:42,160
example Europe and versus for example

1175
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,259
North America and so on basically they

1176
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,618
can really rather stable and so on next

1177
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:46,150
slide please

1178
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,320
well those are used which we were trying

1179
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,120
to clarify

1180
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,530
so basically what we one is falling and

1181
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,850
I'll be very quickly and we can open the

1182
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,950
discussion so what do we want many

1183
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:57,310
levels

1184
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:59,439
one is we base ultimatrix directory and

1185
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:02,380
that's it which is you the user name use

1186
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,060
all the for example exactly same name is

1187
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,530
the one simply we serve as some kind

1188
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,740
like a transport would you like we did

1189
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:10,660
for CDI and there's some it's very

1190
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,430
another one is we don't we don't want to

1191
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:16,270
do it canceled abstraction and so on and

1192
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,950
for example based on it for example

1193
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:20,770
Raynald can i ppm depend on for example

1194
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:22,060
t UDP TCP and so on and if you will

1195
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,350
forward trend eventually now a meter

1196
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,480
training along networking to become

1197
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:27,339
application where for example basically

1198
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,410
prove or not you see for example a TCP

1199
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:30,790
UDP and probably become for example a

1200
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,379
central like an open floor was a match

1201
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,910
condition and for this match condition

1202
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,230
and isolation see you for that map

1203
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,940
condition that is the eventually becomes

1204
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,130
a lot more like generic like so and so

1205
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,710
on so for that says it's more applicable

1206
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:44,230
where for that case because it's an

1207
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:46,540
insane idea as much as possible

1208
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,950
I'm symmetric unit for example you've

1209
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,259
already here was different for example

1210
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:52,120
ok I remember it listens it using like a

1211
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,130
second our community second and so on or

1212
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:56,710
pramana we're happy to discuss about to

1213
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,270
be considering as much as possible

1214
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:03,520
next I think I'm almost done with this

1215
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:05,170
part so basic clay worth a next place so

1216
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,640
what do we want essentially moving

1217
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,950
forward is the following and one

1218
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,350
possibility if people really feel less

1219
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:13,839
ok and of course I think it would be we

1220
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:14,799
talked about it yes the discussion with

1221
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,060
the world of people as well like a

1222
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,080
foreign and so on is one way is we make

1223
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,180
applications depends on and basically

1224
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:24,430
for exam often time is for network you

1225
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,629
probably don't really care about TCP you

1226
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,069
you can often time you care about what

1227
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,810
kind of cream and you really get for

1228
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:30,490
example maybe really like the networking

1229
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,080
really doesn't get significant TCP UDP

1230
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:34,720
perform at me really gives you only on

1231
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,029
for example this is my gold customer

1232
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,379
this my super customer and so on so

1233
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,300
often time you were captive in

1234
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,070
Athens is different jitter and so on so

1235
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,810
what we probably little magic and your

1236
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,400
head of hospice oh your application one

1237
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:48,210
and what kind of category really have

1238
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:51,010
belong and cut you are and then

1239
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:53,020
essentially the high level performs

1240
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:55,500
whoever can be the pack and then piece

1241
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,090
ignition reflecting like the categories

1242
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,670
label the categories and depending on

1243
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,230
applicants

1244
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,299
propagation DNA's for example it doesn't

1245
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:05,040
depend on any applicator here oh oh

1246
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:07,799
maybe for example I think that's a one

1247
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,200
potential we move forward can they go to

1248
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:11,880
last leg I think we're right so

1249
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,799
basically I'm we're on discussed ways

1250
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,869
all these I ppm and make a final

1251
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:17,520
decision and essentially it would be

1252
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:19,140
what can a matter that we really export

1253
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,480
I think a mere suggestion we probably

1254
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,660
should pick a minimal set I know we all

1255
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,859
really need to finalize all the timing

1256
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:28,828
essentially finalized essentially the

1257
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:35,400
naming ideas of Auto matrix and then we

1258
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:37,650
want to really finish this thing okay so

1259
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,130
yeah more comments peace on the mic but

1260
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,230
as a chair I see some skepticism in the

1261
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,780
room and one suggestion that Millia made

1262
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:47,700
was focused on a minimal set of metrics

1263
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,980
to move this ahead and since we are

1264
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,990
lagging behind with our milestones that

1265
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,520
might be an option because the other

1266
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,078
option I see is having lengthy

1267
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,040
discussions that go on and on and on

1268
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,630
right right well we basically a one with

1269
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,849
Lenny just a final come with whatever

1270
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:04,589
that minimum subset is I'm not sure but

1271
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:06,359
right let me animus upset one thing is

1272
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:07,710
very simple is we use a very connect

1273
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:09,210
definition basically I think would be

1274
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,760
probably some kind of agreement between

1275
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:13,829
the auto server and other client so we

1276
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,270
use where connect latency and all stuff

1277
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,740
basically circular users will be

1278
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,660
essentially a very likely be authorized

1279
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,009
already for example syndicate sort of

1280
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,779
for information might be that's a really

1281
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,130
simple way we define connector one we

1282
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,170
don't really go down the rabbit hole of

1283
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,460
defining what's the right green for me

1284
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,049
to talk about matrix P eventual drain

1285
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,240
Alameda trend asymmetric GUI become

1286
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:32,280
essentially very flexible based on to

1287
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,470
match action for from open flow to p4

1288
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,329
becomes so fine green and eventually

1289
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:38,279
probably become less probably very

1290
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:40,650
difficult classical down we just define

1291
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,740
some very generic classes okay here's

1292
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:45,450
current best effort and here are the

1293
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:47,220
propagation latency and here essentially

1294
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,509
those kind of very simple things

1295
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,419
therefore we don't really go down it's

1296
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:52,650
kind of like a fine green application

1297
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,900
distinction I think that's probably

1298
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,400
easily out and Sue probably will be very

1299
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,839
very useful in terms of high-level thing

1300
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,690
and all that other thing is we probably

1301
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:02,940
can try to discuss a little bit which

1302
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,270
matrix we probably don't who is too

1303
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,440
dynamic

1304
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,609
to hard handle we could probably can

1305
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,369
just trim down little bit I think those

1306
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:11,119
that those are the two things I I can

1307
00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:11,119
try to offer

1308
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:19,140
yeah I've been trying to think a little

1309
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,420
bit more detail how that would actually

1310
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:24,029
work right like you said 50 minutes

1311
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,250
whatever that's the Rena value but like

1312
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:29,039
you know would it actually mean that I

1313
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:31,200
kind of sent measurement rubric every 15

1314
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,270
minutes to kind of basically every input

1315
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,770
like you know if requested I could send

1316
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,940
this to every endpoint on the internet

1317
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:38,970
right no you don't do if you don't do it

1318
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,740
right right say I have to maybe one

1319
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:43,410
reminder also for L important to know

1320
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:45,419
the goal of the alto protocol is to

1321
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,808
provide better than random pure

1322
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:50,309
selection that was or that was stress

1323
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:51,930
intentionally because we don't want to

1324
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:54,720
give precise information just better

1325
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:57,899
than random so just to keep in mind that

1326
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,578
this is what we are doing here so and we

1327
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,200
are not giving precise information that

1328
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:06,599
was never the call also of the original

1329
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:08,430
protocol it's better than random so it's

1330
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:15,180
Nouri comrade is it still random what

1331
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:18,029
you're saying you have a source where

1332
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,919
you can access some data and you don't

1333
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:23,099
have to do active measurements that's

1334
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,020
kind of useful but given like as I said

1335
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:27,210
given that the the one who consumes the

1336
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:29,099
data then never really knows how this

1337
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,690
data was generated it's less useful

1338
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:32,309
because sure if you don't really know

1339
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:34,140
what the data means it doesn't help you

1340
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:36,119
it could still be better than random

1341
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,379
yeah but then okay let me propose

1342
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:39,900
something I think it would probably more

1343
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,059
sense for example to just say this is

1344
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,160
probably a high or a low loss link right

1345
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:46,289
on this level rather than trying to give

1346
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,270
any kind of number sure for example

1347
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,890
right now the one matter what you don't

1348
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,720
like a cost like a rocking cost so paste

1349
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,890
you're saying somehow because we do

1350
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,299
actually introduce one thing called

1351
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:55,680
essentially it's numerical versus all

1352
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,788
the notes so you're seeing maybe wow it

1353
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,379
really is for example you're just a

1354
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:59,420
random rank basically cosmetic is

1355
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,500
essentially

1356
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,970
latency but somehow mostly focus on

1357
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,799
ordinal part which is like this is a

1358
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:06,959
higher latency lower latency and so on

1359
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,160
as discrete vice a little bit often time

1360
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,660
one way you want really reduce of

1361
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,890
damping you want to template that in

1362
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,690
process that you'd essentially do some

1363
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:14,879
kind of categorization essential to a

1364
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:22,680
different like a rounding levels that

1365
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:25,619
probably can also help l Morton here's a

1366
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,740
suggestion delay is more than two times

1367
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:31,210
the

1368
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:33,879
you know the airline City distance you

1369
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:35,200
know when you measure it and that's you

1370
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,180
know that's something that that users

1371
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,450
might want to know 2 times 3 times 5

1372
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,819
times something sure that's sure that's

1373
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:44,680
that's something that you know can be

1374
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:46,270
briefly assessed on the network and it's

1375
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,129
mostly about routing it's not about

1376
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:50,530
property and by the way is in the spirit

1377
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:52,270
of the original although idea and not

1378
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:54,160
give precise information but something

1379
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:55,840
that is useful for the application but

1380
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,629
still also doesn't disclose too much

1381
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,330
internals of the ISP right just the hour

1382
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:04,510
ok that's good that's good keep saying

1383
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:06,610
that you know and and the other thing is

1384
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:08,110
is to you don't need to go to the

1385
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:10,780
application layer to say things like

1386
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:12,460
this you know I saw you moving up the

1387
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:14,260
stack there for a moment don't bother

1388
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,790
just you know make some measurements and

1389
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,320
and do the best you can with it in broad

1390
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:19,990
categories I think that's the way to go

1391
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,060
yeah ok let's really here thank you I'm

1392
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,470
sorry I think we would like to wrap it

1393
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:28,270
up or would you want to have a comment

1394
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:31,209
or you yeah go ahead one of the very

1395
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:34,600
goals of Sabine here one of the very

1396
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:39,520
goals of outside decision-making which

1397
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:45,660
end point to select and so one option

1398
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:51,220
that was discussed is also instead of

1399
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:53,319
displaying very accurate measurements if

1400
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:58,080
if this is too complicated or not

1401
01:00:53,320 --> 01:01:02,470
available we can also advertise a score

1402
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:06,069
like between 1 and 20 if you want to

1403
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:07,390
compare yeah I think that was I don't

1404
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:09,960
know why I essentially give something a

1405
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:13,120
score you to normalize in some way and

1406
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,500
anyway I think we sum this up from a

1407
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,910
chair perspective this was a very good

1408
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,890
discussion I think it brought us forward

1409
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:20,920
but the process is pretty clear this one

1410
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:24,970
needs another round yes well this across

1411
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:27,070
let's that's we stopped at that Richard

1412
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:30,009
I think you you you and the co-authors

1413
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:32,440
need to yeah yes our mailing this

1414
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:33,730
discussion keep Mira and Ellen the loop

1415
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,910
that we can come to an agreement and

1416
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:40,239
then you need to try yeah reiterate as

1417
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:42,729
well sounds great right yeah

1418
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:45,609
yeah I think there is some discussion on

1419
01:01:42,729 --> 01:01:47,888
the list leader for this Sabine I think

1420
01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:51,249
you're up next but your time has been

1421
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:53,229
massively eaten into so my suggestion

1422
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:56,109
would be to don't worry about the

1423
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:58,989
changes between the drafts just focus on

1424
01:01:56,109 --> 01:02:02,639
you know if you think it's it's ready to

1425
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:04,899
send out the working group or not yes

1426
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,099
definitely I won't spend so much time

1427
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:09,969
about the tips

1428
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:11,829
they are pretty minor so well I've

1429
01:02:09,969 --> 01:02:15,249
focused actually on the first slide

1430
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:20,829
which is the status on the draft where

1431
01:02:15,249 --> 01:02:23,408
we stand so since last year so that was

1432
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:25,599
the first is G review which to discuss

1433
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:28,719
is the one was immediately solved it was

1434
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:31,389
about the IPR the other one who has some

1435
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:34,599
discuss about the design that was solved

1436
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:39,549
for the previous IETF so we can go to

1437
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:44,049
next slide so the current status is

1438
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:48,999
active so we discussed a couple of

1439
01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:51,849
things in Prague and so this is the

1440
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:55,509
timeline so that was the last working

1441
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:57,569
group last call that ended this last

1442
01:02:55,509 --> 01:03:00,489
Sunday so next slide

1443
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:03,069
so since Prague

1444
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:05,229
there has been an update that addresses

1445
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:09,849
Miria onions recommendation about

1446
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:12,729
clarifying the the the the issue about

1447
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:16,079
JSON encoding and that was also a review

1448
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:20,799
sent by VII so next slide please

1449
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:25,869
so regarding the encoding format the

1450
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:35,619
issue was that the base protocol refers

1451
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:41,559
to JSON an RFC 8259 that obsoletes sorry

1452
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:45,129
the alto calendar refers to an RFC about

1453
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:49,089
JSON format that obsoletes the one that

1454
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:54,130
was used by the auto based protocol so

1455
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:59,640
after discussion we did find that

1456
01:03:54,130 --> 01:04:06,190
there is no extension of Alto that

1457
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:10,210
really is tied to using utf-16 r32 for

1458
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:12,819
encoding so basically so this point is

1459
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:18,220
addressed in the new version in section

1460
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:20,999
7 as next slide so this in this section

1461
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:27,098
we explained that we now use the new

1462
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:30,629
JSON format encoding utf-8 because this

1463
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:33,910
allows into a better interoperation and

1464
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:37,769
so I modified the text there and I send

1465
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:40,839
email to Adam Roche to have his feedback

1466
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:44,288
so about the formulation so next slide

1467
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:49,779
please so then we had a review sent by

1468
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:53,859
Vijay so there was a thorough edit

1469
01:04:49,779 --> 01:04:56,950
session that was necessary especially to

1470
01:04:53,859 --> 01:05:00,538
clarify the text and short and long

1471
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:03,279
sentence and clarify some things and

1472
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:08,079
also a question about the content length

1473
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:13,829
field in HTTP examples so because in the

1474
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,829
draft there are elucidation such as like

1475
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:27,640
yes such as this one okay and it was not

1476
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:30,279
clear in the text whether the content

1477
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,890
length field was accounting for such

1478
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:35,979
elucidation there a next slide please

1479
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:39,900
so the answer is yes actually this file

1480
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:43,180
does account for the like real number of

1481
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:48,910
corresponding to these elucidation so it

1482
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:54,038
explains that it explains this there was

1483
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:58,299
also a rephrasing where to clarify some

1484
01:05:54,039 --> 01:06:02,219
text in a rule and which where I added a

1485
01:05:58,299 --> 01:06:06,130
must and so next slide please

1486
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:07,600
so there is a second working group last

1487
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:12,010
call as I say that just

1488
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:14,529
and eat so with the chairs comment

1489
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:18,460
saying that been indicated a couple of

1490
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:24,220
edge cases he put a discuss item that

1491
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:27,280
was solved in the version 10 and so and

1492
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:28,060
there was also that IPR issue that was

1493
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,480
solved

1494
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:34,470
so I also received some working group

1495
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:37,720
feedback on suggesting on spelling

1496
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:41,609
consistency so I tried to change I will

1497
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:45,580
try to chase them but well I think well

1498
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:50,590
my point of view the the the other draft

1499
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:52,960
is is ready so so from the working group

1500
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:55,270
point of view there was a couple of

1501
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,700
folks that reviewed at Cayenne Jensen I

1502
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:59,200
believe I'll go through one more review

1503
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,520
and then we push it out of the working

1504
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,470
group towards iesg

1505
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,060
and that should happen probably in the

1506
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:10,060
couple weeks or maybe the week following

1507
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:12,610
the end of the ITF okay it's done yeah

1508
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:14,770
so if anybody has anything post now or

1509
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:19,710
we will push it out for sure in the next

1510
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:19,710
two weeks all right thank you

1511
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:54,390
okay Jennsen unify properties unify

1512
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:54,690
property yes look at better okay thank

1513
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:58,879
you

1514
01:07:54,690 --> 01:08:03,650
syncope so antonsen I talk about the

1515
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:07,680
updater but you probably it's a major

1516
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:11,190
auto extensions and because because the

1517
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:15,419
current leader a path vector and I've

1518
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:17,429
seen some other document they become

1519
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,120
working group document at depend down

1520
01:08:17,429 --> 01:08:27,600
indeed and so that's that please think

1521
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:30,809
and in the last few miles actually we

1522
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,719
our cars and some other working members

1523
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:37,109
have a lot of discussion about how much

1524
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:39,750
better clarifies a in fact property tax

1525
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:42,989
so actually in this revision weight

1526
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:46,080
makes a major a piece of the talking

1527
01:08:42,988 --> 01:08:49,889
additions and better clarify the

1528
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:54,019
requirements and the concepts and the

1529
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:57,660
design scope but actually the

1530
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:03,299
specification is not too much modify we

1531
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:06,689
just make some slight modification yes

1532
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:09,778
so in this revision we clarifies a

1533
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:12,778
unified property extension actually for

1534
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:15,140
the client side the client has three

1535
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:18,270
major requirements the first white

1536
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:20,880
client may want to obtain the properties

1537
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:24,029
of the generic entity which is a missing

1538
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:29,190
part in the current auto framework for

1539
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:32,160
example there are some other generic

1540
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:35,189
entities like the not suggests an

1541
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:38,099
endpoint like the PID is a AIS and

1542
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:41,278
concrete and in the past factor we

1543
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,949
introduced a track metamer elements so

1544
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:48,770
object may have a properties a clan want

1545
01:09:43,948 --> 01:09:50,969
a curry and certain crime rates that

1546
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:52,949
encourage these properties of the

1547
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:53,880
entities we don't want to introduce any

1548
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:58,830
message

1549
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:02,460
redundancy and serve I'd say for some

1550
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:07,110
entity properties the server me to

1551
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,940
provide a full might and the clan can

1552
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:13,490
just get format so it's very

1553
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:15,719
straightforward solution in a very early

1554
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:17,790
remission of this document we already

1555
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,980
introduced it's just introduced a cat

1556
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:23,160
can more probably map service to solve

1557
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:26,700
this so you know last rise we will I

1558
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:31,920
will clarify so for the first

1559
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:35,730
requirement what we need to do for the

1560
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:38,100
tea time so actually for the first

1561
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:40,410
requirement the aloe plant should help

1562
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,050
to answer to the following questions

1563
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:47,130
first line is what entity is kind of

1564
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:49,080
auto plant Curie's and sacrifice for

1565
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:51,780
each entity what probably is called who

1566
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:55,010
can cure it so that's the two major

1567
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:58,410
common the questions for the clamps so

1568
01:10:55,010 --> 01:11:01,250
next rage yeah

1569
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:04,800
so first for the first time questions

1570
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:09,510
our basic idea is because in our

1571
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:12,090
previous document revision our designs

1572
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:15,630
it's really also server just announced a

1573
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:19,880
set of tabs and it's tab referred to the

1574
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:19,880
entities of the steam semantics and the

1575
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:28,290
specified ID format for example the ipv4

1576
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:32,310
types will means the entities it's an

1577
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:34,710
ipv4 address of Andy point and they have

1578
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:39,600
the identifier with the ipv4 address

1579
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:43,590
format and we consider an entity's value

1580
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,600
if it's identifier is valid so say each

1581
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:48,120
type will define a complete and did it

1582
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:54,060
side and which consider all the valid

1583
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:58,050
and it is for so by just a pile on Stern

1584
01:11:54,060 --> 01:12:00,900
type the auto client can know so it can

1585
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:03,810
Korean it is seen in the other entities

1586
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:06,978
in this complete on either side which we

1587
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:11,300
announced so but also next back page

1588
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:13,729
yeah but there's a issue that because

1589
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:16,959
not all the valley and it is a

1590
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:20,420
meaningful so what's the meaningful

1591
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:24,709
became an example so the PID defined by

1592
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:27,110
the auto femur a PID is only meaningful

1593
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:30,590
in your natural mind so that's a lot of

1594
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:33,679
widely the PID names but the other

1595
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:35,840
server only to find a properties for a

1596
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:40,760
subset of the this complete hiding

1597
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:45,499
inside so which is a associated to some

1598
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:47,360
metal knives so for a given when we

1599
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:51,099
observed that for a given entity type

1600
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:54,768
and how to information resource to only

1601
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:59,380
contains a subset of the complete entity

1602
01:12:54,769 --> 01:13:02,059
side so which we refer this subset as a

1603
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:05,869
resource page we can hit domain so that

1604
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:07,999
our solution change a to we allow the

1605
01:13:05,869 --> 01:13:12,518
server and also said how resource

1606
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:14,329
pacific any domain most by speak for the

1607
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:20,209
client okay really

1608
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:23,150
and it is so nice page so however the

1609
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:25,579
using the just using the entity ID we

1610
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:27,429
defined previously to identify these

1611
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:30,889
entities may be I'm wicked

1612
01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:33,170
so the because the clans our server need

1613
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:37,280
to distinguish which and digital main

1614
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:40,190
entity belongs to so for example we have

1615
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:43,249
to PIDs ones in the neural map and

1616
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:45,518
natural map to define two different

1617
01:13:43,249 --> 01:13:45,519
apparatus

1618
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:51,949
it means they may have the same

1619
01:13:48,349 --> 01:13:55,670
properties yes and the ass number but in

1620
01:13:51,949 --> 01:14:00,219
the different natural map actually they

1621
01:13:55,670 --> 01:14:05,199
has a different as number of errors so

1622
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:08,479
to teach distinguish them we use the

1623
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:10,759
undetermined names column the domain

1624
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:14,869
specific entity ID to identify each

1625
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:16,999
entities so here for example the the

1626
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:20,030
ended domain names can be the narrow map

1627
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:20,818
one dot PID they are there're Mutulu PID

1628
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:23,099
and the

1629
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:27,179
PID whines just a domain-specific and

1630
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:31,260
edid and we use the nano map one dot V

1631
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:32,309
addict on PID 1 but in Phi H the PID in

1632
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:37,919
the neural map one

1633
01:14:32,309 --> 01:14:39,119
so nest page so we revise the same

1634
01:14:37,919 --> 01:14:41,879
question this way we don't need to

1635
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:45,358
answer each entities what properties can

1636
01:14:41,879 --> 01:14:48,358
carry the other Clank and Kure so we

1637
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:52,169
just ask for each resource pacific and

1638
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:55,649
it domain so which properties the auto

1639
01:14:52,169 --> 01:14:57,719
climbs and curry so we have the basic

1640
01:14:55,649 --> 01:15:00,809
idea is the other services announced a

1641
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:05,789
set of resource pacific and determine to

1642
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:08,549
appropriate type makng so next page but

1643
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:13,858
however for the entity domain in the

1644
01:15:08,549 --> 01:15:16,079
resource passivity for the movie called

1645
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:21,030
the i've di see the mapping

1646
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:25,438
it's a protium probably type appeal may

1647
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:28,139
be ambiguities so we give an example the

1648
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:32,789
narrow man thought I'd refer to the PID

1649
01:15:28,139 --> 01:15:34,919
properties the PID the value of this PID

1650
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:36,688
properties may be defined by either the

1651
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:40,049
narrow my map 1 ow

1652
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:43,829
it just like this the current property

1653
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:48,419
map itself and we need to distinguish

1654
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:51,808
them so the u-p design formulated my

1655
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:54,629
thing as the I thought the I to the out

1656
01:15:51,809 --> 01:15:59,879
of POC here the arrow is elderly

1657
01:15:54,629 --> 01:16:01,469
the results are I all just these and so

1658
01:15:59,879 --> 01:16:02,309
the server can just announced a two

1659
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:07,739
different mappings

1660
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:15,059
to distinguish who provides the proper

1661
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:17,428
team riders but in the FC 70 to 85 the

1662
01:16:15,059 --> 01:16:19,979
other framer the other protocol today's

1663
01:16:17,429 --> 01:16:24,749
it's not a reversed word for the

1664
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:28,799
resurrect so we just use a delta p o2 to

1665
01:16:24,749 --> 01:16:29,608
written this top view some somewhere can

1666
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,439
remember

1667
01:16:29,609 --> 01:16:34,279
suppose maybe we can just use a few is

1668
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:34,279
that the

1669
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:40,469
that characters this just a minor

1670
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:45,449
improvement we can we can the example

1671
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:51,830
body if you we don't have a younger idea

1672
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:55,710
about it we can I don't know

1673
01:16:51,830 --> 01:17:02,309
we want to excite about later body oh we

1674
01:16:55,710 --> 01:17:07,500
can't just move for sure so generally

1675
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:09,420
the we make the design clarification

1676
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,420
guys each probably matched its provide a

1677
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:17,070
set of the IDI Tuesday out of Pio

1678
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:21,480
mappings and this mapping she should be

1679
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:24,590
announced in day probably marked and so

1680
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:27,599
hairless for cases for the mappings

1681
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:33,150
defined but we only considered so far

1682
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:35,760
only three mapping mode a meaningful so

1683
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:38,638
we called the export mode which means

1684
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:42,570
for example the natural map Bank and web

1685
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:46,500
app ipv4 entity to a PID properties and

1686
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:51,840
extend board a PID defined by a network

1687
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:55,260
map plan and they the present probably

1688
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:59,480
my resource extended allocation

1689
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:02,070
properties and this PID how the the

1690
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:06,989
property map just define new actually

1691
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:11,940
for Christ and Japan you probably like

1692
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:14,669
the s number on this IP address' so

1693
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:21,900
that's a scope of our design so nice

1694
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:24,270
page based on this but not arbitrary are

1695
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:28,019
I taught the I to out of here mappings

1696
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:31,260
are meaningful so we need to currently

1697
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:33,449
they announce the mappings should be

1698
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:36,750
meaningful so what

1699
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:38,879
me up the so we give some example

1700
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:41,820
meaningful means the TI must be a

1701
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,370
spotted by a resource RI so here's the

1702
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,710
path example so which means they never

1703
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:50,400
my window is not meaningful because they

1704
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:53,370
the clad to know what's and defined by

1705
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:59,670
the narrower map and in the export

1706
01:18:53,370 --> 01:19:02,849
working mode they di to peel my team

1707
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:06,420
must be supported by a resource out so

1708
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:09,120
we have another bad example it's a the

1709
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:11,190
network map went out ipv4 to the narrow

1710
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:14,820
method yes and it's not meaningful

1711
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:19,080
because they try to know what's a s and

1712
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:27,239
defined by a narrower my plan for and

1713
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:31,320
appropriate for the ipv4 so to if the

1714
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:33,389
meaningful announcement mappings the way

1715
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:37,559
which is introduced some additional ad

1716
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:38,160
and a registries in this new document

1717
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,770
revisions

1718
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:44,849
so for each auto information resource

1719
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:50,160
type the air which is adding indicated

1720
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:51,840
by the imager type with the fan resource

1721
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,449
page we can determine as poverty tree

1722
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,750
and the entity property mapping as for

1723
01:19:54,449 --> 01:20:00,480
registry so that's page will join

1724
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:04,679
example we use a narrower map and in

1725
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:10,019
example so for a network map resource so

1726
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:14,699
I can spell the ipv4 ipv6 our PID hit

1727
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:17,340
domain types and it covers the IP refer

1728
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:19,259
to a PID properties all the ipv6 to a

1729
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:22,890
PID properties so that's the initial

1730
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:25,350
registry and maybe so other in the

1731
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:31,830
future we have them extension we kind

1732
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:34,920
industry to twist so my speed so our per

1733
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:39,809
code so if you update the IRD

1734
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:44,340
from the previous dynasty a set of a

1735
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:47,010
cross product of the set up and hit

1736
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:51,000
domains and the set up probably

1737
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:55,699
who sat on mapping passing a smoke

1738
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,699
mincing and so next pitch

1739
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,650
suppose the risk request we pass a

1740
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:08,670
schema we don't have anything but we

1741
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:11,308
clarify the so the client only just a

1742
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:13,170
still request the cross-product of the

1743
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:17,269
entities a set of entity and the

1744
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:20,989
properties but the server where we know

1745
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:29,159
the mapping which is not enough in the

1746
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:31,879
air D so next page well so for the

1747
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:34,469
second requirement is more likely

1748
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,119
improvement for the current design

1749
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:40,230
because the current exam may introduce

1750
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:42,839
some redundancy we identify two kissably

1751
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:44,909
redundancies wise they request and it is

1752
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:47,489
may be redundant i'm the return entities

1753
01:21:44,909 --> 01:21:51,829
may be redundant and the next page will

1754
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:56,610
shew example so for the first case

1755
01:21:51,829 --> 01:22:00,960
because the appart property map may

1756
01:21:56,610 --> 01:22:04,949
announce a natural my IP refer to the

1757
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:09,179
hpid and may also announce another

1758
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:14,369
natural map to deliver d but if a client

1759
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:17,909
able to curate the IP address for both

1760
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:20,820
days PID properties defined by the two

1761
01:22:17,909 --> 01:22:23,848
different network map in the current

1762
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:28,230
exam it had two Curie to innovative

1763
01:22:23,849 --> 01:22:32,460
entity identifiers so it's redundant so

1764
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:37,888
we introduced a next page we introduced

1765
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:42,809
the improvement solution it's a we allow

1766
01:22:37,889 --> 01:22:47,989
the problem map just use a the nth item

1767
01:22:42,809 --> 01:22:52,380
domain type map to a set of the

1768
01:22:47,989 --> 01:22:53,070
properties which present the equivalent

1769
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,360
entity

1770
01:22:53,070 --> 01:23:00,960
problem mappings to Bob Patrick land can

1771
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:04,330
just curious single

1772
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:08,110
entity identifier took at post two

1773
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:13,450
different properties depend by the

1774
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:18,040
different mappings yeah next page we see

1775
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:22,030
Harry's example if we if the we use such

1776
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:31,269
a design we can revise the arity to mal

1777
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:34,750
compact representation and nest page to

1778
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:38,470
pull the second issue actually very

1779
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:42,040
early we we can already identify its for

1780
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:47,140
some type of entities for example the

1781
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:52,330
ipv4 entities actually maybe I owe their

1782
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:55,780
IP v4 addresses in same say IDR may have

1783
01:23:52,330 --> 01:24:01,090
the same property values such as a as

1784
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:03,910
members but to obtain the s number for

1785
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:06,130
all of this happy for entities the

1786
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:09,970
current land the the client have to

1787
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:16,680
enumerate all the individual IP

1788
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:19,480
addresses in this CIDR so next page the

1789
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:22,780
unified properties introduced a

1790
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:27,580
hierarchy and inheritance approach which

1791
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:30,309
means which means they we we can't

1792
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:33,340
define an entity block representation

1793
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:35,440
for some types of entities for some of

1794
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:39,280
the CIDR can be a until about her

1795
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:41,889
potential for the ipv4 addresses and the

1796
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:46,110
yoga can define a property inheritance

1797
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:46,110
rules on Z and hit block fermentation

1798
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:53,400
okay yes I think that's a last

1799
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:57,309
standpoint yeah and the next page

1800
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:59,230
yeah but in this revision with make some

1801
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:05,590
clarification that the property

1802
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:09,009
inheritance must not be angry so mixer

1803
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:11,470
make some important like the forgiving

1804
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:14,050
entity types if it's sensitive loving

1805
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:16,719
definition it Japan you're very much

1806
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:20,380
be hierarchical and in other words it

1807
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:25,469
cannot be partial intersected so we came

1808
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:25,469
up an example like so if we define the

1809
01:25:26,099 --> 01:25:31,449
ee1

1810
01:25:27,309 --> 01:25:33,460
didn't block even I'd say 192 dot start

1811
01:25:31,449 --> 01:25:36,428
out start and one another entity block I

1812
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:38,880
say when any two thousand years of

1813
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:44,710
Stardust are so they have the different

1814
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:48,929
Essen properties so the class cannot

1815
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:53,159
know what I asked and published for the

1816
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:55,900
IP address in there intercepting set so

1817
01:25:53,159 --> 01:26:00,098
the little introduce some application

1818
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:04,079
and the property curtains rule you

1819
01:26:00,099 --> 01:26:08,889
should avoid this ambiguity so so next

1820
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:14,949
page we make some concluding fold our

1821
01:26:08,889 --> 01:26:20,010
current document revision and the hope

1822
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:25,989
is a clear to better clarify our current

1823
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:28,329
GOP design and if it can nitrate if I

1824
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:33,489
can move this document to they work on

1825
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:35,230
black car after they missing so how many

1826
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:37,678
people have read version eight of the

1827
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:37,678
document

1828
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:52,239
alright so I think given that the

1829
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:55,599
authors feel that this work is ready for

1830
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:56,530
working group last call I think just to

1831
01:26:55,599 --> 01:27:00,099
be conservative

1832
01:26:56,530 --> 01:27:03,909
it'll be nice if at least a couple of

1833
01:27:00,099 --> 01:27:07,059
people can first read version eight post

1834
01:27:03,909 --> 01:27:08,799
their comments and then we would like to

1835
01:27:07,059 --> 01:27:10,360
go for a working group last call now it

1836
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:16,650
could be that if the comments are deep

1837
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:19,150
enough and you know reasonable enough

1838
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:21,730
they could serve as a working group last

1839
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:23,530
call but at least the chairs field right

1840
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:24,669
now to try to take a home for working

1841
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:27,579
group class called seems a little

1842
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:34,949
premature since nobody has read it

1843
01:27:27,579 --> 01:27:34,949
so can can somebody volunteer to read it

1844
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:44,860
we can start picking victims awesome

1845
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:51,969
yeah sure thank you we have thank you to

1846
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:58,389
volunteers thank you both Mike and say

1847
01:27:51,969 --> 01:28:02,730
yeah yeah there's good trade-off on

1848
01:27:58,389 --> 01:28:02,730
telefónica thank you thank you thank you

1849
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:08,199
Barney Bowden from Sprint

1850
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:09,909
okay thank you excellent that would be

1851
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:14,769
very very good and then we can move

1852
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:17,710
ahead depending on the comments yeah but

1853
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:20,679
still I think from a chair perspective

1854
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:22,150
this is then ready for being send out we

1855
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:24,429
just want to make sure that you know we

1856
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:26,009
get a review done but you basically

1857
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:28,050
resolved all the technical issues

1858
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:30,579
correct yeah correct

1859
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:32,260
so but that brings that back up the

1860
01:28:30,579 --> 01:28:34,000
question do we want to do a working

1861
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:35,590
class call for path vector because all

1862
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,360
the dependencies have been resolved or

1863
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:39,880
do we want to well we should then wait

1864
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,920
on the comments I guess because they

1865
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,409
have a high dependency yeah so yeah so

1866
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,420
yeah basically I think the ACA's

1867
01:28:44,409 --> 01:28:50,679
feedback I should be slowly and it would

1868
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:52,480
be right so I think problem right thing

1869
01:28:50,679 --> 01:28:54,790
to do is we don't help you of your

1870
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,888
comfortable bit about unified properties

1871
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:58,929
because past record does indeed write

1872
01:28:56,889 --> 01:29:00,969
you more kit so therefore you should

1873
01:28:58,929 --> 01:29:03,449
just somehow get four dollars yes I

1874
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:06,610
agree

1875
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:09,369
Jiang says that I will read the draft in

1876
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:11,170
post comments as well great agree good

1877
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:16,598
thank you for all of those that were on

1878
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:19,809
here then so next one I see sitting I

1879
01:29:16,599 --> 01:29:21,699
yeah it's a bit quick and because we've

1880
01:29:19,809 --> 01:29:27,790
seen is almost ready

1881
01:29:21,699 --> 01:29:30,489
and just from next page so in the latest

1882
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:35,349
revision for the CDI apps a document may

1883
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:38,049
be the major change is about the edges

1884
01:29:35,349 --> 01:29:40,440
and some minor improvements the change

1885
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:44,600
the naming and the

1886
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:48,299
in front of wordings and updates and

1887
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:52,530
examples and education to matching the

1888
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:56,700
latest GOP document and the SSE document

1889
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:59,519
also and make some clarification on the

1890
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:05,250
vertical arrow handling and revise a

1891
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:11,160
example so next page is quickly go over

1892
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:15,990
the repeated if you remember they post

1893
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:18,840
too many issues for the last in the last

1894
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:19,410
night a meeting at for the absolute

1895
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,230
document

1896
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:26,510
it's very issue is servicing the city

1897
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:30,209
IFC is not okay whether stuff format and

1898
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:33,750
the clear alistair format because in the

1899
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:37,100
auto protocols a map service looks like

1900
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:40,020
they were from Stouffer might like the

1901
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:43,310
network map service and cost map service

1902
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:46,470
but the city i FCI

1903
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:51,000
object defined by the FCS on a under its

1904
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:54,090
own seats it's not a cursed or so but we

1905
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,240
still keep the message steamer with not

1906
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:59,880
change the protocol specification but we

1907
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:02,400
renamed the city FC i'm a service to the

1908
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:05,040
justice city FC a service in the latest

1909
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:12,320
document and for the second issue it's

1910
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:15,570
that we want to allow the curie by the

1911
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:18,990
not not not only by the footprint on all

1912
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:21,059
the only possibilities it can purify

1913
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:24,240
join the footprint and capillaries but

1914
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:29,280
in the working to have any strong

1915
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:32,510
pinning to allow this use case so kindly

1916
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:35,670
readjust to now address it and if appeal

1917
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:37,860
happens companies they can propose

1918
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:42,900
another extension is minister necessary

1919
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:47,370
so in the next page we did such

1920
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:50,969
renaming and in the cover they all the

1921
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:54,210
the whole document and renamed such my

1922
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:54,680
service to the adjuster called a service

1923
01:31:54,210 --> 01:32:00,000
yeah

1924
01:31:54,680 --> 01:32:03,420
in the most immediate haven't a data

1925
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:07,440
format so next page it's also written

1926
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:10,680
renamed the new footprint type from the

1927
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:12,629
auto natural map to the auto PID because

1928
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:16,320
it's more convincing

1929
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:17,660
it means the foot footprint Weiler in

1930
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,750
such a type

1931
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:32,430
it's a PID defined by another Auto never

1932
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:35,480
map and nest page it's because we the

1933
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:40,170
City FC I also use it probably mark to

1934
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:45,530
better provide the a client can cure

1935
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:50,700
curative care police by the footprint so

1936
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:54,500
we just update the example to use the

1937
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:58,280
latest to tablet map from the I

1938
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:02,040
mentioned is from the course product

1939
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:08,280
purplish to the Isetta mapping yeah so

1940
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:12,960
next page is the update example a bit in

1941
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:21,570
the request and the response so next

1942
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:23,580
page at issues a example the relating

1943
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:26,250
example how to use the increment updates

1944
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:29,370
the assessee document to to ingram abbot

1945
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:32,160
the city I've see a resource but we know

1946
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:35,730
notice at the kissing Matt merge patch

1947
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:39,450
will always includes a whole city app CI

1948
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:42,599
resource so we made some correction that

1949
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:52,080
it's not commonly to use it is

1950
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:54,800
multi-strategy GFCI so next page it we

1951
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:58,440
also made some clarification on the

1952
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:03,150
request process and the error handling

1953
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:06,750
part so because based on the protocol

1954
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:08,070
arrows defending in the section fat16

1955
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:10,950
baby

1956
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:14,599
the undefined capita type and weathers

1957
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:17,400
is invalid in the erequest and if the

1958
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:21,600
plans since at acrylic server will

1959
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:27,150
master returner and invalid felt whether

1960
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:29,010
arrow so for the we mentioned only for

1961
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:31,170
the valley today accomplished if this

1962
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:35,670
server does not define any footprint

1963
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:41,640
white the server test images from the

1964
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:47,270
response and nest page its way

1965
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:50,580
introduced open discussion that shall we

1966
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:54,600
allow the city after a service announced

1967
01:34:50,580 --> 01:35:00,269
a spotty see di capelli types and values

1968
01:34:54,600 --> 01:35:04,410
in its IRT because in the app see is on

1969
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:08,040
six and I thought eight in the in issue

1970
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:11,040
with I own a registry so native NJ a

1971
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:19,590
given example the only defend the HTTP

1972
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:25,230
1.1 atps 1.1 as the spotted providers

1973
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:29,070
that may be a new prototype like the ATP

1974
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:32,129
to may be really stirred but the point

1975
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:36,360
is old Auto server may not be advocate

1976
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:41,000
to slowly so which means for this auto

1977
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:41,000
server it will consider this wider it's

1978
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:50,610
invalid because it's not registered into

1979
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:53,190
the energy stream and in its

1980
01:35:50,610 --> 01:35:56,339
implementation consider its invalid but

1981
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:58,739
for the new Auto clan if you consider

1982
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:03,690
it's valid whether it just may be the

1983
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:07,589
auto server doesn't define the footprint

1984
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:11,580
for this value so it was surprised why

1985
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:15,480
the server will return the invalid field

1986
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:17,940
wider error to this plan so if you if we

1987
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:20,849
announce the spotted cavity type and the

1988
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:21,860
wailers the we can prevent a grant from

1989
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:25,190
sending such

1990
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:31,450
wasted requests so it may be just a

1991
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:31,450
increment it may not be very necessary

1992
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:47,090
the LAN but we want to introduce a tit

1993
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:49,760
of discretion play and so basing the

1994
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:50,150
class are also think it's this document

1995
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:56,420
already

1996
01:36:50,150 --> 01:37:00,080
so almost down so now we can go to the

1997
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:02,420
working Glasgow after the meeting yes so

1998
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:05,360
and I'm a co-author of this and I

1999
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:08,300
totally agree so we we as authors think

2000
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:10,969
this document is very ready and as chair

2001
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:13,190
now changing my head and what we

2002
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:15,680
discussed yesterday also in with the

2003
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:17,269
authors but also previously today's we

2004
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,040
want to involve author the CD and I

2005
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:20,740
working group to have a final look again

2006
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,970
theoretical they should theoretically

2007
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:24,679
there should be no issue because we're

2008
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,780
not changing the semantics of the CD and

2009
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,940
I Jason format we're just transporting

2010
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:31,700
it you know just to be fair you have

2011
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:33,259
them look so what I'm thinking currently

2012
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:35,120
right now as I will send an email to

2013
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:36,710
this CD and I work in group and tell

2014
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,170
them guys we are shortly issuing a

2015
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:40,520
working class call and give them a heads

2016
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:42,590
up so they have more than two weeks

2017
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,970
right and it might seem a little unfair

2018
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:45,740
free issue working class call right now

2019
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:48,500
and just give them two weeks so maybe

2020
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:49,730
I'll send them an email guys that we are

2021
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,140
finishing this piece I have a local

2022
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,870
working group last call is coming soon

2023
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,520
will inform you to and maybe also one of

2024
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:57,980
them can be reviewed during the working

2025
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,690
class call so my guess is we do issue

2026
01:37:57,980 --> 01:38:02,120
the working class called in two weeks or

2027
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:03,530
something and I tell the city and I give

2028
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,849
this either networking the heads up and

2029
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:06,349
then we have another two weeks for the

2030
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:09,860
working class calls so they have a month

2031
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:11,870
to to look at it and then we ask one of

2032
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:15,230
them to one of their participants review

2033
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:17,780
it and one of our group and that's my

2034
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:19,940
plan yeah the question is Jensen but we

2035
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:22,670
can take this offline if if we issue a

2036
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:25,639
new version in the meantime because the

2037
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:28,130
the last issue you had there at the IR T

2038
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:30,470
changes yeah yeah all right we can we

2039
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:33,980
can issue a small update in between but

2040
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:35,870
I don't feel strongly about that yeah I

2041
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:38,059
think I'll leave it to you guys too

2042
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:41,000
version or update or not that change is

2043
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:42,650
fairly small but again as we look for

2044
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,980
working group here working group last

2045
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:48,830
call here and coordinate with CDN I

2046
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:51,049
please you know need participation from

2047
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:53,480
the working group list members to also

2048
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:55,340
review this assuming we get one from CDN

2049
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:57,379
I we would just need at least one person

2050
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:01,700
from auto working group to take a look

2051
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:08,420
at it from W GLC perspective so for the

2052
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:10,460
notes we're going to give two weeks for

2053
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:12,380
the draft to percolate here will

2054
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:13,730
immediately inform city and I that we

2055
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,480
are going to have a working group pass

2056
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:16,849
call in two weeks

2057
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:19,790
and then we have two weeks for somebody

2058
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:22,940
to review it internally in auto and then

2059
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:23,210
we issue a working group last call all

2060
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:27,589
right

2061
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:31,220
any feedback on this in that case Danny

2062
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:37,580
you're next and if you can get us a

2063
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:39,530
couple minutes that'll be good I think

2064
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:41,600
we're doing great in time we still have

2065
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:43,160
about 20 minutes so maybe Danny you have

2066
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,450
ten minutes and then we have another ten

2067
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,620
minutes for the general discussion I

2068
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:49,010
think you're doing great yeah you will

2069
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:50,660
keep a couple of his lights maybe by the

2070
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:52,280
way for those of you who've missed it I

2071
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:56,090
forgot to mention this actually we had a

2072
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:58,190
paper on the a nrw workshop and many of

2073
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:59,750
the co-authors are here and this is very

2074
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:02,150
related to Dennis presentation right now

2075
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:03,440
and I think it's a good success also for

2076
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:05,089
our working group that we had a pepper

2077
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:07,879
there and you know show that the

2078
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:09,950
community our work so congratulations to

2079
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:12,740
the authors which I should have said

2080
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:15,349
actually this is doing work with people

2081
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:25,280
at Yale University spring Erickson

2082
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:37,520
telefónica no cam okay I will skip a

2083
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:41,559
couple of yes okay next please keep maps

2084
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,560
X next

2085
01:40:43,369 --> 01:40:49,790
here here we have a high-level overview

2086
01:40:46,369 --> 01:40:52,790
about the key alto mechanisms and

2087
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:55,550
constructions in particular Alto

2088
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:57,530
provides different mechanisms such as

2089
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:59,719
information resource directory to

2090
01:40:57,530 --> 01:41:02,869
provide a list of available information

2091
01:40:59,719 --> 01:41:05,889
resources and to provide an infant

2092
01:41:02,869 --> 01:41:08,269
consistency in order to allowed we

2093
01:41:05,889 --> 01:41:10,400
specified the a dependency between

2094
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:14,270
differing information resources and

2095
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:16,369
information at a model to to controller

2096
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:20,330
to a string control push an incremental

2097
01:41:16,369 --> 01:41:23,509
update of the information resources Alto

2098
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:26,179
also introduces a set of instruction

2099
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:27,860
modules such as the network map or Kozma

2100
01:41:26,179 --> 01:41:30,530
to to provide a network location

2101
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:32,440
grouping occurs between then the patch

2102
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:35,509
vector instruction to provide a more

2103
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:38,030
detailed routing information and using a

2104
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:40,400
step net or elements and the fruit broke

2105
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:42,320
the capability map such as the unified

2106
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:47,598
property maps or the fruit peelings

2107
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:50,769
capabilities X please basically we have

2108
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:52,969
the overview about the all alto

2109
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:56,179
documents in the nest column including

2110
01:41:52,969 --> 01:41:58,040
some potential topics and the discussion

2111
01:41:56,179 --> 01:42:01,060
to be addressed such as extension from

2112
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:05,540
your detectors attention for in settings

2113
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:08,090
on alto survey in order to try to to

2114
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:14,080
summarize the coding and implementation

2115
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:18,590
in real use case scenarios etc next next

2116
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:20,540
so basically currently many multi-domain

2117
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:22,460
use cases are emerging with the

2118
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:25,519
development of new technologies such as

2119
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:27,619
as the egg and a free if IG example of

2120
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,960
such use cases including the multi

2121
01:42:27,619 --> 01:42:32,330

few alternative meeting difference draft

2125
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,589
were submitting summarizing the the

2126
01:42:40,429 --> 01:42:45,110
experience of developing multi domain

2127
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:50,900
application using alt of Hira we have an

2128
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:55,040
incomplete list of the X please so here

2129
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:56,820
basically we have a couple of example of

2130
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,700
premier scientific

2131
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:02,040
experiments the Hadron Collider and

2132
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:03,929
Square Kilometre Array such experiment

2133
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,910
pushed scientific discovery boundaries

2134
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:08,300
and rely on workflows that coordinate

2135
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:10,610
geographically distributed resources

2136
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:16,140
next please

2137
01:43:10,610 --> 01:43:19,740
and here we have the moving of the data

2138
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:22,980
from the LHC tier 1 tier 0 to t 102

2139
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:24,929
basically this same network like weight

2140
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:27,750
multiplied demands we get the ordinary

2141
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:30,060
resources to run multiple different

2142
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:33,240
applications or jobs of the key

2143
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:35,310
requirement in this type of distributed

2144
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:37,260
with workflow is the ability to straight

2145
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:39,780
multiply resources across multiple

2146
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:42,930
domains for heterogeneous applications X

2147
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:44,429
please here we have the multi

2148
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:45,840
dimensional function chaining where

2149
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:49,230
basically young and doing network

2150
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,820

a specific order a network operator has

2153
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,589
stepped over in the to the customer the

2154
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,660
possibility of configuring network

2155
01:43:58,590 --> 01:44:03,030
service was a specific requirements his

01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:05,340
term of resources or performance such

2157
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:09,840
resources are expected to be available

2158
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:13,430
across a different domain with different

2159
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:18,030
technologies or administrations X please

2160
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:20,790
he connects he will have another

2161
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:22,920
potential potential use case that to

2162
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:25,710
expand define great net capability of

FDM from into the main set up to to

2164
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:30,480
multi domain setting to provide flexible

2165
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:31,889
inter domain routing a traditional

2166
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,440
internal matter and the protocols are

2167
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:37,380
limited at because they provide single

2168
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:40,080
parroting and limiting the decline spot

2169
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:42,600
choices so flexible multi domain routing

2170
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:45,540
allows to user to specify ratting action

2171
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:47,730
at the provided level with more flexible

2172
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:51,600
matching conditions and more choices on

2173
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:53,639
roads and not only currently use at

2174
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:59,390

antiquorum next please next to to solve

2197
01:45:56,900 --> 01:46:06,530
the the the multi domain or to solve the

2198
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:08,810
or we use the multi domain extraction to

2199
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:10,969
solve the application layer optimization

2200
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:14,090
across multiple networks typically

2201
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:17,570
previous case examples can be modeling

2202
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:21,590
as an optimization problem F where were

2203
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:25,370
where F is an optimization function with

2204
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:27,440
to tie off parameters X representing the

2205
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:30,220
network parameters and Y representing

2206
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:32,870
the application parameters the

2207
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:36,590
optimization function is also next

2208
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:39,110
please is is also composed is subject to

2209
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:41,840
to a two type of constraint the

2210
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:43,690
constraint related to the natural

2211
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:47,990
resources and construed to the

2212
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:49,580
application resources the lack of full

2213
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:51,559
knowledge make or control over the

2214
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:54,080
underlying network it can limit the

2215
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:57,170
potential values of of X for example a

2216
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:58,490
delay bandwidth packet loss etc next

2217
01:46:57,170 --> 01:47:01,150
please

2218
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:04,460
using the multi domain adore abstraction

2219
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:06,530
is a method to provide such cost in

2220
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:07,460
order to solve this this optimization

2221
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:11,780
problem

2222
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:13,110
next please and what is the divisive

2223
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:16,199
formulation basically applique

2224
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:18,719
into that we denied we're asking for to

2225
01:47:16,199 --> 01:47:22,049
carry traffic us for a set of flows

2226
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:24,449
sample he will have to two flows a F 1

2227
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:27,929
and F 2 on each flow will travel

2228
01:47:24,449 --> 01:47:30,480
different networks each flow cutters had

2229
01:47:27,929 --> 01:47:33,360
a set of network properties at delay

2230
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:37,138
available bandwidth etc hanging a multi

2231
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:38,909
domain settings a another property may

2232
01:47:37,139 --> 01:47:41,760
involve nether property of multiple

2233
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:44,099
component networks for example the delay

2234
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:46,190
should be the zoom of the delay on each

2235
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:50,340
network that the flow will will travel

2236
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:51,750
next please so the basic idea have to

2237
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,940
provide the ability to discover

2238
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:56,670
aggregated expose information of

2239
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:59,250
multiple networks to provide a single

2240
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:01,440
consistent built on network view and

2241
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:03,389
represent this information using a

2242
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,290
generic compact mathematical programming

2243
01:48:03,389 --> 01:48:08,369
constraints

2244
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:10,469
next please just to give an analyst at

2245
01:48:08,369 --> 01:48:13,290
the example here we have a single

2246
01:48:10,469 --> 01:48:15,929
neighbor where where a user want to

2247
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:17,850
reserve two circuits from search squad

2248
01:48:15,929 --> 01:48:20,550
to his nation one confluence from source

2249
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:23,790
to destination to Bob Sieck we share

2250
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:25,500
common links your link 3 and Link 4 a so

2251
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:27,980
that is not possible to reserve a

2252
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:31,170
hundred gigabit for both circuits

2253
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:33,030
next case so using the mathematical

2254
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:35,219
programming constraint week we can

2255
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:36,570
generate linear inequalities to provide

2256
01:48:35,219 --> 01:48:38,699
a comparator presentation of the

2257
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:39,360
available bundle of flows through a

2258
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:43,080
network

2259
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:46,559
example a x1 and x2 represent the

2260
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,730
available bandwidth for for flow 1 flow

2261
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,730
2 respectively

2262
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:54,429
next please this restaurant

2263
01:48:52,730 --> 01:48:56,690
represent the resource availability

2264
01:48:54,430 --> 01:49:00,610
radio of the neighbor for providing

2265
01:48:56,690 --> 01:49:03,259
resource to a set of flow as such some a

2266
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:06,679
linear linear inequalities can be

2267
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:10,100
redundant takes place using the

2268
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:12,470
redundant inequalities egg can be

2269
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:14,900
removed using a polynomial time optimal

2270
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:17,480
algorithm next please

2271
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:19,820
so let's take the previous example from

2272
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:22,639
a single network to multiple network

2273
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:24,500
here we have a user that went to reserve

2274
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,170
to three circuits from source to

2275
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:29,990
destination one two and three each

2276
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:32,150
network will will using the mathematical

2277
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:33,679
Brahman constraint which each member

2278
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:36,110
neighbor will disturb the bandwidth

2279
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,310
sharing for its circuit into a set of

2280
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:42,799
linear inequalities

2281
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:44,690
next please although each domain being

2282
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,490
already conducted on the redundant

2283
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:49,610
systemization there can be across the my

2284
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:54,170
redundancy for example the flow to and

2285
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:56,089
flow three in a member tangled and but

2286
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:57,890
never drink and eliminate the flow

2287
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:59,710
through and flow three member and I work

2288
01:49:57,890 --> 01:50:01,910
to next please

2289
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:05,030
using the multi demand I don't and

2290
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:10,309
Septimus a show we can remove this this

2291
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:12,860
London and next place just to tourists

2292
01:50:10,310 --> 01:50:15,650
reverse view basically the key main idea

2293
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:17,839
to aggregate the extraction in multiple

2294
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:21,530
net or into a unified single single

2295
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:25,810
ambient WA representation and next

2296
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:28,250
please just just to quickly summarize a

2297
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:30,890
multi-play import a multinomial ocation

2298
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:33,800
can benefit from alto however new this

2299
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:36,650
attic warming also merge and different

2300
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:38,450
graph graph have been proposed it to

2301
01:50:36,650 --> 01:50:41,690
address some of the design requirements

2302
01:50:38,450 --> 01:50:43,370
as net test it is to make a systematic

2303
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:47,599
investigation of the deployment conserve

2304
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:49,120
of alto economic incentive fifth ability

2305

scalability privacy security

2306
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:54,740
consideration and to make a systematic

2307
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:58,370
design of the attention to address the

2308
01:50:54,740 --> 01:51:02,240
reset requirements that's it as just to

2309
01:50:58,370 --> 01:51:05,769
mention that we have regular wear

2310
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:09,860
quickly meetings every Wednesday night

2311
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:25,040
30 us ester time for feel free to join

2312
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:27,049
us that's it thank you I know you have a

2313
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:28,580
draft associated with this and for a

2314
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:30,530
long time obviously we are not going to

2315
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:33,170
adopt any new drafts in the working

2316
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:34,700
group but considering that this is

2317
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:36,290
something of interest both to the

2318
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:38,420
research community and perhaps the

2319
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:40,220
operator community one thing we might

2320
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:44,690
want to think about is moving the draft

2321
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:46,580
head as a independent ad sponsored but

2322
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:48,500
we can talk about that later

2323
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:51,470
clearly you put some work in the draft

2324
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:53,840
so I think you know we can we can move

2325
01:51:51,470 --> 01:52:00,500
it ahead if you guys are interested ok

2326
01:51:53,840 --> 01:52:03,620
thank you alright right yeah you are

2327
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:07,400
Jenna I didn't discussion on topics

2328
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:13,670
beyond the working group Richard you

2329
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:15,170
want to say something or others no no we

2330
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:16,280
have the time you have some time so we

2331
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:20,600
have five more minutes if you wanna

2332
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:22,880
video talk about some ongoing things

2333
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:31,900
which were working on and the issues

2334
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:31,900
which want to address yeah you do I do

2335
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:40,910
so clearly this is just mostly trying to

2336
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:44,240
really define a little bit the issues or

2337
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:46,250
items which we might want work and of

2338
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:48,559
course there are beyond account working

2339
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,180
group deliverables so therefore they are

2340
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,760
not really in the Charter and so on and

2341
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:55,100
it's a result of a lot of discussions

2342
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:57,440
yeah a lot of discussion with a lot of

2343
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:59,450
people and I think that if you the

2344
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,860
wonderful job to show people about it's

2345
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:02,840
like a regular meetings we have every

2346
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:04,610
Wednesday so so other people are more

2347
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,840
welcome to drawing all these discussions

2348
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:07,700
and I think that they're wonderful

2349
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,790
wonderful these couches so next is

2350
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:13,670
please so basically at really high level

2351
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:15,320
and this is an beyond or current working

2352
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:16,550
group items I said we're trying to

2353
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:19,099
address two issues

2354
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:20,930
and one yes Network information

2355
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:22,310
abstraction for applications basically

2356
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,540
what kind of content so basically we're

2357
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:26,240
really talk about abstraction so

2358
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:29,170
therefore what kind of abstractions and

2359
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:31,820
the content we should really come up and

2360
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:33,470
the second one of course is we have all

2361
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:35,269
the content and how to really carry

2362
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:37,340
those content from the network to the

2363
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:39,380
users and that's essentially information

2364
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:40,580
retrieval or transport and that's

2365
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:42,410
essential the protocol path so therefore

2366
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:44,960
essentially we're focusing on these two

2367
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:46,880
aspects and about work it will be in the

2368
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,850
context of application or aware

2369
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:52,160
networking next slide please

2370
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:53,210
and I probably can skip this one I think

2371
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,610
most people are already familiar with

2372
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:57,800
essentially let's Auto Protocol and as

2373
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:59,089
the transport layer thing and just pull

2374
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:00,440
the slides over there for people to take

2375
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:01,970
a look we have all kind of things I

2376
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:03,320
think Daniel also had this like a very

2377
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:05,650
nice picture showing a central of the

2378
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:09,290
bigger pictures next slide please

2379
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:12,080
and here is a set of abstractions which

2380
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:15,019
we the auto working group so far has

2381
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:16,400
defined already so basically what kind

2382
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,900
of abstraction Yury one abstract you

2383
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:21,200
don't want to go to like details for

2384
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:23,660
example like a tunnels and all like a

2385
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:25,480
very very fancy like forwarding tables

2386
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:28,010
and so on so here is a list of

2387
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:31,339
abstraction basic you have nodes and you

2388
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:33,320
have a pass you have Co flows and so on

2389
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:36,020
so those are most basic abstractions

2390
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:38,320
which we have introduced in working out

2391
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:41,150
a working group next slide please

2392
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:42,799
so this one probably slightly easier to

2393
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:44,059
visualize about working abstractions

2394
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,460
which are the auto working group has

2395
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:48,080
introduced and you have boundary of nose

2396
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:51,050
and the taste and I think that's the

2397
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:52,820
general concept and the and the entities

2398
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:54,170
would essentially you can read a great

2399
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:57,019
office entities to define something

2400
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:58,610
called networking map and of course then

2401
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:00,410
you have like either for example from

2402
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:03,259
the entities or from aggregate of

2403
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:05,150
entities you can define in component car

2404
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:07,010
services essentially the link property

2405
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:09,019
and of course you can also get all the

2406
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:10,490
properties on demand of course you can

2407
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:12,290
also have Co flow which means you really

2408
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:13,670
worry about set of Transportation's and

2409
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:15,290
really go together and that's

2410
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:16,820
essentially called pass vector and you

2411
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:19,210
really have abstraction called call flow

2412
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:21,740
next slide please

2413
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:23,360
so I think we can skip this one those

2414
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:27,230
are all the current working document and

2415
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:29,240
so on and we can skip this one okay so

2416
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:30,500
now I do want to talk about a few

2417
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,210
ongoing efforts

2418
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:35,990
which potential it can be interesting

2419
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:39,140
and follow group so one of course the

2420
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:40,550
item is the alpha deployment so the

2421
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:42,800
basically setting is very simple is

2422
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:44,720
focus for example this is one example of

2423
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,700
deployment I think Daniel already also

2424
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:48,650
mentioned is a wonderful is for example

2425
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:50,780
focus is collaborative at the Shubert

2426
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:52,429
hit execute data sciences and for

2427
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:55,639
example one driving project is the

2428
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:57,530
project called sense is team phone and

2429
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:59,420
in network the sciences at access skill

2430
01:55:57,530 --> 01:56:01,190
and basically application already

2431
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:04,100
planning to be supported I think then

2432
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:06,169
mission I would see here is essential

2433
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:07,760
black hole astronomy and they really

2434
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:11,570
Clark you terminal data doing all these

2435
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:13,010
like analytics and one meaning work I

2436
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:14,990
think for example using this current

2437
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:16,790
group is to solve the issue is a car

2438
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:18,679
service is reporting for exam time block

2439
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:20,720
maximum bandwidth by name is sliding

2440
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:22,580
window I'm time banning its production

2441
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:24,290
zone basically is and those are

2442
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:25,910
wonderful wonderful test cases to see if

2443
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:27,740
Auto can really support also use cases

2444
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:29,750
are not so I think those are really will

2445
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:30,800
be should be one more type of which I

2446
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:32,750
think working groups are really looking

2447
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,490
to a lot of features can we support

2448
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:36,560
these kind of things there already a lot

2449
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:38,990
about patient and for this earlier part

2450
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,460
but we need you message if we can reduce

2451
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:44,840
all these like a true use cases on that

2452
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:47,570
next ice piece so the second one I think

2453
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:48,890
the items and beyond the current deliver

2454
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:51,019
both would be the following item

2455
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:53,450
essentially focusing on the protocol on

2456
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:56,030
the transport layer and those essential

2457
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:57,380
on top all the green buttons essentially

2458
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:59,450
they define the current transport

2459
01:56:57,380 --> 01:57:01,370
mechanisms for example we have

2460
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:03,260
information resource directory where

2461
01:57:01,370 --> 01:57:06,620
information resources and immediate

2462
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:08,540
hives and consistency and have grammar

2463
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:10,519
we have all this stuff and I'm fortunate

2464
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:12,440
victory and so on so if you look at

2465
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:14,900
looking back and you ask yourself what

2466
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:16,519
can the transport entities might be

2467
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:17,000
missing you can identify a little bit

2468
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,860
for example

2469
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,420
IRD with context information I think

2470
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:22,040
that's one issue which something has a

2471
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:24,320
tremendous increase and which I think be

2472
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:25,970
very useful and in current for example

2473
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:27,139
currently we have single media type

2474
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:28,880
essentially with the about one media

2475
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:31,430
type for one and more and more for all

2476
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,170
these consensus consistency requirements

2477
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:34,730
or we premiere war about multi-part

2478
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:36,560
information resources I think that's

2479
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:38,750
another item would be interesting and

2480
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,620
right now we're focusing on single or

2481
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:41,000
JSON grammar

2482
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:42,800
maybe we should really look at for

2483
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,120
example like using Llamados as a tuner

2484
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:45,620
for example grammars and so

2485
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:48,410
how much we should go down with it and

2486
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:50,630
iconic transport layers use SSDI which

2487
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:52,550
is useful which turns a very simple very

2488
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:55,550
easy to use and so on but Ryan for

2489
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:57,110
example there be a new more flexible and

2490
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:59,150
more potential more efficient the

2491
01:57:57,110 --> 01:58:00,650
transport protocol HTTP 2 and those

2492
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:02,240
external potential can also change our

2493
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:07,670
transport layer protocol they are

2494
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:09,559
potential items next slide please so

2495
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:10,940
here will be talk about essential all

2496
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:12,620
the new abstractions which will be

2497
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:14,000
potential should overcome I think on

2498
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:15,650
life and say we talk about all kind of

2499
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,510
abstraction we'd already mentioned

2500
01:58:15,650 --> 01:58:19,790
briefly but there are a lot of like

2501
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:22,190
anything domains and beyond ipv4 ipv6

2502
01:58:19,790 --> 01:58:23,390
for example like a cellular and so on

2503
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:25,639
all the domains which we have not

2504
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:27,920
defined and we probably define in some

2505
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:29,660
way and then we should have probably

2506
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,670
more generic unified you know the code

2507
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:33,080
flows multicast multipaths we're not

2508
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:34,640
really dealing with some huge systemic

2509
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:36,920
over yeah so I think those I central

2510
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:39,290
abstraction we proudly introduce and we

2511
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:41,150
have XD IMAP we probably for the go to

2512
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:42,590
the generic network capabilities or for

2513
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:44,019
all the network functions and so on I

2514
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:46,100
think it become very useful and

2515
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:48,440
currently we only have very simple

2516
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:49,670
filtering capabilities and one thing we

2517
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:50,839
really have a lot of interest which

2518
01:58:49,670 --> 01:58:52,970
problem it can be very useful like

2519
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:54,320
networks sacral language I think that's

2520
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:56,510
a really beyond anything which I know

2521
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:59,330
and IETF will potential it can be very

2522
01:58:56,510 --> 01:59:01,010
useful and of course also like Canada

2523
01:58:59,330 --> 01:59:04,730
concept and so I think no very useful

2524
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:06,110
please so of course last one which I

2525
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:08,059
want to mention about protector items

2526
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:10,040
which people are working on and really

2527
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:12,260
what I should mention is it's a back in

2528
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:13,850
and realize realization for exam even

2529
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:15,110
today a lot of discussion about what can

2530
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:16,670
imagine meant and so how do we do

2531
01:59:15,110 --> 01:59:18,049
measurements for example there are a lot

2532
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:21,170
of cushioning already on for example by

2533
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:24,020
Lao and also tactful you very credit

2534
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:26,330
triggered measurements and collect all

2535
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:27,980
the data start and collect madam smartly

2536
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:30,410
I have formalized protocols and real

2537
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:32,509
accurate meaning accuracy and freshness

2538
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:33,530
and so on I use proxies and so in

2539
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:36,170
central there are a lot of these

2540
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:38,960
conditions and really back in his work

2541
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:40,910
which can be very useful for the success

2542
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:43,310
of this particle okay

2543
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:47,510
and I believe that's all I want to say I

2544
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:49,700
think I probably finished Brent right on

2545
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:52,100
time yeah perfect

2546
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:55,309
ok I think this is very interesting

2547
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:56,570
thoughts on what happens next - all - I

2548
01:59:55,310 --> 01:59:57,199
mean for those of you that have been

2549
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:59,509
with us

2550
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:01,339
the inception you know the first idea

2551
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:05,539
for Alto was to just get a course

2552
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:07,579
network information to applications when

2553
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:10,280
we reach our turd although we moved from

2554
02:00:07,579 --> 02:00:12,380
you know a single computer view to what

2555
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:14,150
used to call it Richard my network view

2556
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:17,119
or yeah might have could be of yes right

2557
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:19,489
to path vector and and and other things

2558
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:21,139
so the next iteration of fall tour once

2559
02:00:19,489 --> 02:00:23,690
you finish all of the documents that

2560
02:00:21,139 --> 02:00:27,699
yeah right now some of us were thinking

2561
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:31,518
might very well be operations you know

2562
02:00:27,699 --> 02:00:34,369
focus on Alto but they're also ops

2563
02:00:31,519 --> 02:00:35,989
well coops yeah okay so but that all

2564
02:00:34,369 --> 02:00:37,610
depends on the energy of the working

2565
02:00:35,989 --> 02:00:39,440
group and once we are done with our

2566
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:43,449
deliverables that's something that we

2567
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:46,098
can talk about at that particular idea

2568
02:00:43,449 --> 02:00:47,539
wonderful right because what what you

2569
02:00:46,099 --> 02:00:50,059
described in the last night is pretty

2570
02:00:47,539 --> 02:00:51,829
much in line of that with that like how

2571
02:00:50,059 --> 02:00:54,199
the operation of this right exactly

2572
02:00:51,829 --> 02:00:55,909
provisioning interface was intentionally

2573
02:00:54,199 --> 02:00:58,549
out of the Charter for now but you know

2574
02:00:55,909 --> 02:01:01,179
in an ultra operational setting that's

2575
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:05,300
or Alto offset certainly something

2576
02:01:01,179 --> 02:01:07,400
correct yes so if there's no other

2577
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:09,019
comments then thanks for being here and

2578
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:13,848
we will figure out what to do in

2579
02:01:09,019 --> 02:01:14,630
Singapore so thank you folks and have a

2580
02:01:13,849 --> 02:01:27,670
nice day

2581
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:30,670
thank you thanks so yeah thank you

2582
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:30,670
everybody
