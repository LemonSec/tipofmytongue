we've got some hackathon updates and

25
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:16,579

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,158

27
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:21,470
tomorrow afternoon if you're looking for

28
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,610
a good time there's the applications you

29
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,479

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,939
right after lunch though

32
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,950

33
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,809
imagine it's a week good so lots of good

34
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,469
discussion in there so just giving you a

35
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,840
heads up on that there's a draft in the

36
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:46,070
interior that came to our attention on

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,829
provisioning domains and the terminology

38
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,770
is a little different you know everybody

39
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,908
uses overloads the word domain a lot but

40
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,130
it's in this working group last call and

41
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:01,700
it's about doing stuff with multiple

42
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,350
interfaces and it's it's definitely

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,700
there is some relevance there and it's

44
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,890
sort of like that stuff to resolve a

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,440
problem worried this this stuff has to

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,270
sort of keep track of what domain is

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,579
doing what what interface is doing what

48
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,860
basically so this seems to be big in the

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,150
mobile world and also b6 with mobile

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,800
stuff going on so

51
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,100
of course this happened today the RTF

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,490
workshop but tomorrow afternoon during

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,720
the open meeting they'll be there a good

54
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,850
discussion under storing the role of

55
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,150
registrar's in Jena SEC deployment and

56
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,239
so that was a hot talk so guys should

57
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,540
pay attention to that moving on to the

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,670
documents updates so we've got the

59
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,760
algorithm update since last meeting and

60
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:50,660
the capture formats been in it's been in

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,820
all 48 for like a year now it's slowly

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,680
making its way so they've gotten all the

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,930
references sorted out and I think they

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,780
finally you and Sarah finally sort of

65
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:04,040
nailed everything down so but it's been

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,270
a long run for them though so we have

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,650
three things and we're actually a couple

68
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,750
things more than three things in working

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,420
book last call the no response draft

70
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,950
which had a lot of discussion for a

71
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,440
while and it's kind of gone silent but

72
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,940
with all the flag day conversations you

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,210
know since everybody's getting on Flag

74
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,740
Day now I feel that it's time to sort of

75
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,280
put this to working group last call so

76
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,170
folks send comments a list approve a

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,050
publication don't approve it you have

78
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,070
comments I think they've done a great

79
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,500
job of cleaning it up

80
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,109
Mark's been patient with me so I

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,370
appreciate that

82
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,870
so please we'd like to hear some stuff

83
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,220
about that even if you want to get up

84
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,140
into my clan and just yell about it I

85
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,690
think it's you know this is the time

86
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,829
28:45 biz finally we finally got this

87
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,780
they're working for glass call I think

88
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,440
this started in Prague two summers ago

89
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,870
and it's it's it's done the right

90
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,000
updates it fixed it takes a problem so

91
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,780
again that one's ready to you know

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,120
please send some comments about that

93
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:09,320
serves Dale it's working for Glasgow

94
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,490
until tomorrow till the 23rd so we've

95
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,829
definitely hear about that and there's

96
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,810
one more yes extended error this is

97
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,609
partially my fault I need to wrangle the

98
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,530
author's a little more on that there are

99
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,988
some comments we need to get sort of

100
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,400
fixed up and then there is a discussion

101
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,890
about the IANA registry he's not really

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,890
documented in the current draft and it

103
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,020
probably needs to be less looking sort

104
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,270
of confused

105
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:40,430
and so that sort of came up but up

106
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:42,740
please correct me yeah so Warren and I

107
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,470
actually met a month ago or so and

108
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,720
worked through the our code missing

109
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,250
number of bits issue got it all done and

110
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,360
then an hour before the deadline of

111
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,639
course I finally got around to

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,919
submitting it without checking say some

113
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
of the other points in the document that

114
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,770
listed the wrong number of bits and

115
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,409
things like that so I apologize for that

116
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,599
that's my fault there is an I in a

117
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,039
registry section always okay

118
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,830
yeah yeah there has been for a long time

119
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,210
and using current boilerplate text if I

120
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,159
recall too but I need to go back and

121
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,289
double-check that it matches I'm pretty

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,940
sure it does and I believe mr. Eastlake

123
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,360
had some comments that we're still

124
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,250
sitting out there in my inbox a brief

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,800
reminder mention your name of the mic

126
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,949
yeah I started group I'm resolved in

127
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,630
West Hart occur from is I yes there are

128
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,460
other outstanding comments we wanted to

129
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,690
hit the are code one because that seemed

130
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,729
like the biggest and I wanted especially

131
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,580
the implementers that have started

132
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:36,590
tinkering with it

133
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,930
go look we did change the packet format

134
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,549
so unfortunately it had he done so go

135
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,770
look at that but the other comments are

136
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,060
more minor inner disk texture okay so I

137
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,080
will try and get that out in a couple of

138
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,030
weeks cool thank you so and that's sort

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,880
of our mediator angle you authored about

140
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,400
that so you'll see here from you soon

141
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,409
yeah with respect to the Ayana registry

142
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,789
specifically I think it was me that

143
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:03,949
flagged that and I think there was some

144
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,360
question one of the things I was hoping

145
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,479
people will pay attention to when we're

146
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,159
revealing this document is whether the

147
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,780
extension mechanism proposed and the

148
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:16,580
policy on the IANA registry is is

149
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,750
optimizing the usefulness of the the

150
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,889
document and the mechanism and the

151
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,570
reason I'm looking back is because this

152
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:27,500
this fancy monitor here is not working

153
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,539
so I have no idea why a couple things in

154
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,490
call for adoption yeah Dena server

155
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,800
cookies actually we believe that has

156
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,099
wrapped up and should be adopted and

157
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,250
then the yang model that's in going

158
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,060
through some interesting discussions and

159
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,510
kind of understand where things are

160
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,660
going on that so those are

161
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,010
wrap up here pretty soon and then we

162
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,410
have some updates on some current stuff

163
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,659
so sumon sent us this about the multi

164
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,130
provider D in a sec they've made some

165
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,040
changes to it they've added some

166
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,469
sections and actually looks like they've

167
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,820
cleaned up some stuff you know they and

168
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,230
from looking at the updates and looking

169
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,580
at and talking it does seem like it's

170
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,950
getting close to working group last call

171
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,080
we'd like some folks to review it but

172
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,099
it's getting a lot more discussion

173
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,039
especially among the vendors and stuff

174
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,360
about how to do in a sec across multiple

175
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:19,540
riders so I appreciate that

176
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,700
so I'll TLD so one of the authors came

177
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,860
to us and said hey we think this is

178
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,130
still useful we want to know if the

179
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,800
working group wants to work on this we

180
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,000
have you know we if we you know we're

181
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,080
not you know we felt that we're not sure

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,180
if the working group actually has the

183
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,340
energy to sort of discuss namespaces is

184
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,990
that that sort of turns and do not

185
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,369
really dns but more architecture kind of

186
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,170
discussions so you know if we feel that

187
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,730
we get a lot of feedback like oh yes we

188
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,400
want to discuss this and kind of beat

189
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,910
this down to some more our suggestion we

190
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,080
thought about this and we feel this will

191
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,150
be a great document to sent through the

192
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,010
internet area and send it through the

193
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,599
general area and have the ATS basically

194
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,430
Shepherd it because it's a standard

195
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,590
track it discusses you know Caesar

196
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,070
application or Internet I said I've seen

197
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,390
an application they said internet but

198
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,849
have it through the general area and

199
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,469
have it discussed that way and then you

200
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,780
can still get the standards track which

201
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,470
we feel which is what the AI is G is

202
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,280
basically trying to get us to do anyway

203
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,020
then I'll still get the proposed

204
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,500
standard that's better than doing ad

205
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:27,070
sponsored for example so now I haven't

206
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:31,330
told the entities this but you know it's

207
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:35,010
like surprise but because I do think if

208
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,510
you think about sort of TLD space it's

209
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,630
it's more I think it's more in that area

210
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,169
so then it is you know sort of in the

211
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,000
it's sort of an ops area sort of thing

212
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,260
it you know we can have a former ad

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,630
stand up to the mic and tell us you know

214
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:54,730
I'm sure there's one back there sort of

215
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:55,939
hiding in the corner though this one oh

216
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,280
great yes

217
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:03,260
moving vlb to historic this is fantastic

218
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,610
so oh sorry mr. Sullivan hi my name is

219
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,140
Andrew Sullivan and I work for the

220
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,630
internet society but I don't speak for

221
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,939
them right now on the previous item if

222
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,800
this working group can't come to

223
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,600
agreement that this is a good idea or a

224
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,449
bad idea and you send this off to say

225
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,550
the Jenn area my prediction is that

226
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,360
they're gonna say I wonder what the DNS

227
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,979
offed weenies yes about that is true so

228
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,870
this may be an opportunity to prove that

229
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,650
we can do routing loops in the IETF

230
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,400
itself but are you sure that you

231
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:36,610
actually want that problem I you know I

232
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,260
don't know what problem I want you know

233
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,030
and I want the group to tell us what

234
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,620
problem to give us right you know this

235
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,990
is a group want us to sort of chase this

236
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,280
you know che and and I think if we you

237
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,970
know I don't think they have the energy

238
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,370
for it

239
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,730
you know maybe they do and maybe I'm

240
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,770
gonna be shocked but you know I'm

241
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,000
thinking of how can we how could we move

242
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,430
forward because we've been asked to move

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,230
it forward and if we can't get the

244
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,630
energy here or how can we do it or maybe

245
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,240
it doesn't get it just it dies a slow

246
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,220
death that you know well I mean this

247
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,970
would not be the first thing ever to die

248
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,890
a slow death so III mean I I guess what

249
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,450
I'm suggesting and you know my name was

250
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,840
I don't know if it still is but it was

251
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,910
on this at one point on my my feeling is

252
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,870
that it would be wise for us to make the

253
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,510
decision you know to put this to bed or

254
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,520
to death yeah you know sort of

255
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,350
expeditiously if that's what we actually

256
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,640
plan to do because I'm I'm just nervous

257
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,070
that what's gonna happen is we're gonna

258
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,260
spend another spin we're gonna send this

259
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,610
to the gin aerialist I don't know if

260
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,380
you've been reading the genereal list

261
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,150
anytime recently but I'm not sure that

262
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,380
this is good that a lot of attention

263
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:49,160
there no no that's very good point all

264
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:53,090
right Jerry huh Sharon watch how come I

265
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,439
just following on what he said when when

266
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,630
we have routing loops actually in

267
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,810
backbones eventually TTL expires and it

268
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:02,120
drops on the floor actually may be the

269
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:08,209
most appropriate solution yes just drop

270
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:09,500
this focus I'm also a little

271
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,300
uncomfortable

272
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,300
with this document not fine if the

273
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,459
content of it but because when this

274
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,910
whole mess happened with the Torah and

275
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,980
their special domains we sort of froze

276
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,630
all new special domains so that we

277
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,300
wouldn't get more people trying to

278
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,430
quickly sneak in more of these proposals

279
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,589
and now we're coming up with our own

280
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,120
proposal to do this so it's it feels a

281
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,210
little weird to me to continue this

282
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,100
document no it does and I think one of

283
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,450
the conversations there was there was a

284
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,430
slightly different history of that yeah

285
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,200
was we probably you know like somebody's

286
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,880
guilty for enok so maybe we needed

287
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,040
killed me for you know answerable

288
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,550
domains etc which seems like wow that's

289
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:57,819
you know that's lots of TLPs right so

290
00:11:49,550 --> 00:12:00,439
yes okay but very good point what we did

291
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,990
was step back from delegating new

292
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,460
special use names until we had done some

293
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,110
other substantive work in the working

294
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,110
group which we did with the problem

295
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,080
statement document which is now RFC

296
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,890
something-something and we asked for

297
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,030
further guidance from the isg because we

298
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,830
said we didn't know how to proceed

299
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,770
beyond the problem statement listing the

300
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,540
issues one of the things that was

301
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,160
suggested that we go back to was this

302
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,550
document which actually predated the

303
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,560
problem statement RFC another another

304
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,270
document we were asked to consider was a

305
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,609
draft that I wrote and that the working

306
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,650
group was not interested in taking up so

307
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,750
it's not that we stopped and then and

308
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,170
then proposed our own change to the

309
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:46,940
registry if we want to if we want to

310
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:55,040
advance this document we can't that's

311
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:56,630
hurt occur I say no hats I think the

312
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,010
reason that this document has tumbled so

313
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,689
much in this group is that we can't come

314
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,240
to some decisions that turned out to be

315
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,500
hard right they're they're not easy some

316
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,150
of them are political some of our more

317
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,860
technical whether you delegate it's

318
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,160
signed or unsigned you know how you deal

319
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,870
all of that that makes it hard and it

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,640
makes us not want to do it because we

321
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,950
can't necessarily come to agreement I

322
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,459
think on the other hand if you look at

323
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,860
the cited is it needed there's been a

324
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,489
lot of community members outside the

325
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,250
IETF

326
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,649
don't say inside the ATF we have a

327
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,470
solution there's a lot of other people

328
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,180
that have indicated a high level of

329
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,910
frustration for not having something

330
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,890
like this in a delegated play space of

331
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,480
their own and and granted I hate

332
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,750
first-come first-serve that the horrible

333
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,820
answer to anything but if they're if

334
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,800
they're unable to to register themselves

335
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,089
in the global namespace that's

336
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,680
problematic now I don't know why they

337
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,709
can't use your ends either but they

338
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,810
don't so if we're unwilling to solve

339
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:58,359
this problem and the world thinks that

340
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,359
this is a problem we're at a odd space

341
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,360
warren kumari with no heads other than

342
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,700
Delta quickly responding to what poor

343
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,100
voters said much of the purpose of this

344
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,279
was actually sort of corel stuff like

345
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,140
onion open its own place um but I think

346
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,060
that both myself and I haven't spoken to

347
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,490
my co-author but I think both of us are

348
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,260
fine if the skies we just don't know

349
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,660
what the working group wants it was

350
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,779
really interested at one point if they

351
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,730
no longer are but would be nice to know

352
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,040
I suspect that if we were to send it to

353
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,860
Gen or int or anywhere else they would

354
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,329
say this looks remarkably D&S ish why

355
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:43,070
don't we seems to do a nurse up here

356
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:45,260
myself and it would be I am Paul vixie

357
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,410
I guess no hats I don't come to these

358
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,810
meetings very often and so I'm I'm

359
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:56,990
behind on my procedural knowledge but

360
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:59,170
first I want to agree with les something

361
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,290
like this is kind of needed just like

362
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:05,329
1918 was kind of needed and and that's

363
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,189
my personal view but my professional

364
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,859
view is that if we're going to do

365
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,050
nothing we should find a way to record

366
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,570
the road not taken' and the reasons we

367
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,609
didn't take it so that people who are

368
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,089
tempted to throw it back at us and

369
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,910
actually look at a negative RFC that

370
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,589
says don't do this and this is why and

371
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,140
they'll know that that is the answer

372
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,149
they would get from DNS op rather than

373
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,770
not being able to find some answer I

374
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:32,750
don't know if there's such a thing as a

375
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,890
negative RFC but this would be a call

376
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,649
for one yeah thank you

377
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,540
No thank you I personally I think some

378
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,939
this probably isn't in it but I'm not

379
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,498
sure how to go about it and I think Paul

380
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,719
was right we should record it either way

381
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:51,920
right we need to sort of lay the path

382
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:57,550
out for people moving forward so though

383
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,550
so maybe oh sure

384
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:03,589
we'll talk to you okay

385
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:06,170
[Laughter]

386
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,230
so maybe something slightly more buy so

387
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,790
absentee vlv I every everything was

388
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,730
positive about this I we heard no

389
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,410
negative feedback at all so we did our

390
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,179
little research and figured out there's

391
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,999
several different ways to do it figured

392
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,740
out the right process which kind of put

393
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:22,819
the put the little bit of onus on the

394
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,350
working group but not much and then

395
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:28,639
shoved it all on the ad which was like

396
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,199
hey sounds great to us so by the pretty

397
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,029
much by the end of IETF I hope to get

398
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,849
any comments sort of editorial comments

399
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,259
about it I believe it's all very it with

400
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,329
eyes did a great job on sort of putting

401
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:41,029
it all together and and then at that

402
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,290
point we'll do some data tracker stuff

403
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,850
and we'll send it over to Warren and

404
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,360
we'll start that process to move

405
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,649
everything that historic so anybody have

406
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,809
any sort of feedback on that that would

407
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,620
be great but document is simple

408
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,829
straightforward

409
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,149
well well-written can't say anything

410
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:58,579
can't say anything but good stuff about

411
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:03,649
it so and we get rid of the elbe right

412
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:07,129
that's I think it's a good day the TCP

413
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:10,429
requirements they did a version recently

414
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,360
and it looks like we've I went through

415
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,890
the document it looks like they've

416
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
covered all the two news and the missing

417
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,220
things that they were sort of trying to

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,569
fill in and it's getting we feel it's

419
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,309
pretty close to working group last call

420
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,959
so we'd like to get a little bit review

421
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:23,898
and we'll probably do that here are some

422
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:28,039
kinds of summer the next one is zone

423
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:31,399
digest yeah another one of doing and the

424
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:34,299
last update introduced a you know some a

425
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:36,500
bigger change than sort of you know and

426
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:38,480
we haven't heard much comments on that

427
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,679
but that's in the same place we feel

428
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,480
that's really ready for working through

429
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,340
class call as well once we hear some

430
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,750
good reviews and things of that nature

431
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,770
and then 718 7816 biz actually I don't

432
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,740
know what's going on with that we have

433
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:56,300
to go figure that out

434
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:58,760
though that it yep

435
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,379
so what else we're working on steps in

436
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,370
the data tracker we have things in

437
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,780
github the links are in there

438
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,729
so today the agenda cuz it's only an

439
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,830
hour I'm actually the first thing is the

440
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,540
hackathon results well it's gonna be

441
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,960
doing those and then he's going to give

442
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,790
us an update on the server cookies and

443
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,100
then Paul's gonna talk about 76006 biz

444
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,360
which we first thought was ready for

445
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,629
working group last call but now it's not

446
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,810
I think he's got a couple things to fix

447
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,580
the latest terminology spin so and then

448
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,889
most of the big stuff is for tomorrow

449
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,889
this is a short meeting so I think

450
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:57,440
that's it any other comments things to

451
00:18:33,890 --> 00:19:00,740
say then we'll get to it then well um so

452
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:07,730
these are the results of the DNS trick

453
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:13,190
at the hecatomb held last weekend we had

454
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:17,420
a galimov free of 70 eclectic dinesh

455
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:21,470
hackers working on 10 projects which

456
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:26,420
could roughly beatified it in 14th one

457
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:28,730
was about dmoz privacy one about dienes

458
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:33,290
support for specific network

459
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:42,200
environments provisioning miscellaneous

460
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:46,760
with only one project in it so we had a

461
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:51,400
lovely areas and hands-on work on shots

462
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:55,790
but which is jean transfer of TLS they

463
00:19:51,400 --> 00:20:00,080
worked on a client implementation for it

464
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:02,940
in the Tina's Java library but as

465
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:08,428
Patrick created a

466
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:10,830
don't proxy with a fast CGI interface so

467
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:16,440
that it can be used with any web server

468
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:22,678
and we had whittled preparing by 9 for

469
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:26,820
dot and out then the the DNS for

470
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,169
specific Network environments Stefan

471
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,320
boards Maya

472
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:34,799
he already implemented earlier the issue

473
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:41,158
resource Weka type for the identifier

474
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:43,590
locator and network protocol but name

475
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,320
server or a resolver actually needs to

476
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:51,480
do some additional processing to make

477
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,570
that work char he worked on that yeah he

478
00:20:51,480 --> 00:21:01,740
had a reckon implementation will not and

479
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:09,779
I work in progress in for embarked Mark

480
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:14,909
Andrews had a bird on translating ipv4

481
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:18,330
addresses into ipv6 prefixes for the

482
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:21,149
unit six for not check for environment

483
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:24,299
for a benign so if you download the

484
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:27,748
slides and you want to try out some of

485
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:31,230
the hex there's a link to the github

486
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:33,119
repository with patches so that you can

487
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:38,369
patch by line and try it for yourself

488
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:42,059
and dinners provisioning so I worked

489
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:44,779
with Andre and beetles and remote

490
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,549
participant it Alexis on Venus cookies

491
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:51,409
interoperability we're going to tell you

492
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,408
a bit more about that later on

493
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:00,899
yeah this is also interesting Mark

494
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:04,408
Andrews and Tim bottom bear built on the

495
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:08,699
D next time out resource record it's a

496
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:12,690
resource record for professional ad

497
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,690
nation with Venus updates will be short

498
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:20,370
records that have a expiry time

499
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:23,280
and so here again are the references to

500
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:26,389
the IOC github which contain these

501
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,389
fetches Oh

502
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:43,160
and finally my colleague evolved omens

503
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:43,159
worked on HTTP s sv c which is

504
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:51,330
alternative for a name i support as well

505
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:57,720
instead of that the name server provides

506
00:22:51,330 --> 00:23:01,050
the dynamic addresses for name at the

507
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:06,990
apex the work is done in the browser or

508
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:12,149
the program that is also it's HTTP by

509
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:18,690
following the differences mentioned by

510
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:21,950
the HTTP SVC research record and finally

511
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:28,050
in the category miscellaneous he had a

512
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:33,840
llamo output from dig and delve by Evan

513
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:37,440
hunt and power of month so Evan first

514
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,720
wanted to implement or he was thinking

515
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:47,250
about implementing mediation output in

516
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:49,770
the RFC 847 format for deenis but it

517
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,050
would he prefer to output in llamo

518
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,810
because it's more readable and he

519
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:59,639
discussed this with all who is the main

520
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:04,620
author of the JSON format power event

521
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,320
and this is now already used in pulse s

522
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:10,260
sac proof of concept root server

523
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:17,879
management framework for later she and

524
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:19,790
visuals so that's the visuals of the

525
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,690
echo phones we had lots of fun

526
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:26,450
interoperability and also between thank

527
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,100
you thank you very much good to see that

528
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,800
existing a new work is being

529
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,520
implement different pieces of software

530
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,889
and from prototype proof of concept to

531
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:44,270
the production code

532
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:44,270
Thanks next

533
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:58,740
yep

534
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,740
[Music]

535
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,740
yes go ahead

536
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:14,909
yeah the dienes circuit cookies cookies

537
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:17,890
that's right so DNS server cookies are

538
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:21,940
Deena's native protection mechanism

539
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,620
against amplification attacks but to be

540
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,150
helpful it needs to be implemented

541
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:34,479
everywhere so multi-vendor cooperation

542
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:37,809
is desirable this is a hard work if a

543
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,929
client creates a cookie which is more

544
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:43,539
less a nonce actually sends it to the

545
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:45,610
yellow surface or the client is a visual

546
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:48,730
part and the server here is a

547
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,639
alternative name server name shell

548
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,740
creates a server cookie based on the

549
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,080
client cookie sends the back to the

550
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,929
client and then later on the client

551
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,168
returns its own cookie plus the surfer

552
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:06,820
cookie to change server and the server

553
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:10,870
can recognize that this circuit cookie

554
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:15,039
can only be baked by itself because it's

555
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:19,989
also using a server secret to make the

556
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:22,299
cookie and so it knows that the client

557
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:28,740
is a returning client

558
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:31,510
it's not a spoofed source IP address so

559
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,059
and this is good because authoritative

560
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:37,750
can if they see the cookies correct

561
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:41,530
provide larger answers or do not do

562
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:45,190
response rate limiting so here's the

563
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:49,539
problem that we have before the Dimas

564
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:53,200
cookies the the recipes that were used

565
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:56,289
by the service to make the cookies were

566
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,669
a different show that if a cookie was

567
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:01,990
made by by mine

568
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:05,200
so should say it was not not visual fur

569
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,440
did not like that cookie and dispersed

570
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,500
of it

571
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:14,990
so the we have a drug to make sure that

572
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,810
cookies were made with the same recipe

573
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:21,440
and that all the different DNA surface

574
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:25,909
would make the cookie in same way and we

575
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:29,110
had a hackathon project at the ITF 104

576
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:32,560
in Clark and managed to have

577
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:36,350
interoperable sure cookies between

578
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:45,230
behind paladinous honestly not venus and

579
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:49,370
inbound and after that she says the

580
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,590
merger with draft from Donald is like

581
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,679
and Mark and boosters were also

582
00:27:51,590 --> 00:28:01,939
addressing the problem with accessing

583
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:06,770
cookie the changes that we did to the

584
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:09,350
new draft where that fix of a mistake

585
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,389
sure free cookies needed to be based on

586
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:15,560
not just apply to cookie but also had

587
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:20,990
the client address we use only ship

588
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:24,560
hatch to the file for the algorithm the

589
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,380
create that I am a shut registry for

590
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:32,480
different versions for different recipes

591
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:35,300
to make cookies and the drafts we had

592
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:41,060
some operator advice on service it was

593
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:45,770
well over yeah implementation at five on

594
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:49,070
how to facilitate smooth roll over and a

595
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:53,530
appendix it test factors so different

596
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:56,540
implementations can check if the recipe

597
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:03,320
is the same as the one described in the

598
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:07,940
twelfth so lost hackathon the has again

599
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:11,659
a new round of implementing the initial

600
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:15,320
cookies with this new recipe and had

601
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,750
interoperability testing between bind

602
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,260
nine powered units energy an imbalance

603
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:24,419
which was

604
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:28,730
successful another thing that came from

605
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:31,380
the hackathon is that in the draft it's

606
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,570
stated that the client cookie or it

607
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,320
recommends that the client cookie is

608
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:41,490
generated from the client IP Atlas but

609
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,918
this is quite impractical to implement

610
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:49,350
so that the reason for this is I believe

611
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:52,410
sheiks privacy extensions so but you

612
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:56,639
would like to avoid it is that cookie

613
00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:00,000
revealed that the the same sort

614
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:06,270
certified if the IP source IP address

615
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,330
changes but there is no easy way to do

616
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:13,440
this for you to be you to be shocked at

617
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:16,590
its stateless if you create it it does

618
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,640
not have a source IP address yet early

619
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:22,649
after it sent out and then it's too late

620
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:28,350
the we want to modify this text a little

621
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:31,890
bit to recommend for visual of us to not

622
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:35,629
use the client IP address and selling

623
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:39,980
out or when creating cookies but

624
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:43,740
recommend for step read offers to indeed

625
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,809
use the client IP address because those

626
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:52,679
are the parties that benefit the most

627
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:56,480
from the privacy extensions as well so

628
00:30:52,679 --> 00:31:00,390
that's the the status yeah there was a

629
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,480
call for adoption which finished loss

630
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:06,240
Saturday indeed

631
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:11,850
so it's a working group working group

632
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:17,340
document right now and it it's a pretty

633
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:19,350
straightforward draft the repairs its

634
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:24,990
requests and a mission in the original

635
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:28,770
dienes cookie graph IRC so thank you for

636
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:32,159
the implementations that Interop test so

637
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,090
we would actually with two days ago we

638
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,830
wanted to go straight

639
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,240
for a working group last call but I

640
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,730
understand the artists want to

641
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,590
straighten out some issues but it's also

642
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,620
for the room to pay attention on this

643
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:46,189
document because it's already very good

644
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:50,520
work very well shape and we want to put

645
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:54,150
actually yeah sure what we want to do

646
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:57,540
now is update this text on creating the

647
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,470
client cooking yes and then to make it

648
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,600
work

649
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,810
Rutina some jobs yeah and then perhaps

650
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,699
create production quality augmentations

651
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:09,540
between all the different vendors and

652
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:14,640
ask a operator that uses in government

653
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:26,070
to test its excellent work for them and

654
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:44,940
then any questions comments yeah thank

655
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:50,700
you thank you this with the part where

656
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,620
you start so yes I think I'll look this

657
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,900
way

658
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,629
thank you yeah it's it's inconvenience

659
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,940
sorry yeah it's okay probably gonna be

660
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:03,410
out in time cuz both this and the next

661
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,760
one will probably be fairly short so

662
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:09,900
hopefully everyone is familiar this

663
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,990
isn't gonna work Warren and I are

664
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:18,720
writing 7706 Biss we've talked about it

665
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:20,760
before it's still in process but we're

666
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,710
getting close we're so interested in

667
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:30,780
stuff like these so it's getting close

668
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:32,610
to done but it is not done done and what

669
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,379
we have done which everybody asks for

670
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,199
the obvious stuff is we updated the

671
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,850
examples from 7706 because now we have a

672
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,030
bunch of implementations in common

673
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:44,070
software so that we think is done and we

674
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,290
would love people to take a look at the

675
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:50,280
examples

676
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:53,190
but we actually have some to do's that

677
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:57,680
we left in that we haven't to done so we

678
00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:02,310
need to do those one of them is that

679
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:06,360
7706 due to working group discussion

680
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,400
leading to 7706 we didn't put these

681
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,609
cases in really well and they have now

682
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,220
changed since 7706 so we need to put

683
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,230
those in and have them discussed on list

684
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,178
we can put words in if there's silence

685
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,100
on the list I'm going to take that as no

686
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,110
one's reading the list because I know a

687
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,168
lot of people cared about this when we

688
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:27,090
did 7706 so you're still going to care

689
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:28,500
about it now and I'm talking to people

690
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,800
in the room who are not just Andrew

691
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,449
Sullivan well I mean I think a lot of

692
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,250
people remember Andrew was the one who

693
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,100
got up to the mic and was very active on

694
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,389
the list for 7706 but a lot of people

695
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,360
are like yeah what he said or no I

696
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:44,969
disagree so there may be that much here

697
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,370
and that's okay getting the use cases

698
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:49,500
correct in this document is going to be

699
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,469
very important for people reading at 5

700
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,070
and 10 years later because in fact the

701
00:34:52,469 --> 00:35:00,029
way that the root zone happens changes

702
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:02,070
over time and people need to understand

703
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,840
why were we talking about it in a

704
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:13,050
certain way in 2019 or 2020 depending

705
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:15,990
and we also have to explain more exactly

706
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:18,210
why are we here on this so not just the

707
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,069
use cases but what got us to this point

708
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,980
so again what Warren and I will put

709
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,840
words in will do a new draft but we do

710
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,030
expect the working group to actually

711
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,440
look at it I mean if anyone only wants

712
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,690
to do in working group last call that's

713
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,020
fine but generally working group last

714
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,400
call is mostly useful for we've already

715
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,140
looked at it and we think it's pretty

716
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,340
done and I think these two might be a

717
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:43,980
little bit useful for people look at so

718
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:46,920
and then we also have to go through and

719
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,440
really do a careful comparison with 7706

720
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:55,440
so that the section says changes from

721
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,690
7706 is actually complete so we'll have

722
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,430
I haven't told more on this but we will

723
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,520
have another draft

724
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,828
by the end of August not your head yes

725
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,200
that's a month from now okay so a

726
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:10,170
scrunched up face with a nodding yes so

727
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,299
we will most likely get a draft before

728
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:16,819
the end of August and then we'll ask for

729
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:19,410
working group last call but if what no

730
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:24,000
warned saying end of July and I'm saying

731
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:26,240
no because I also have a life and I

732
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,589
would like to go home for that life so

733
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,939
but you know again we're not in a rush

734
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,740
so we're not like oh we need to have

735
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,660
this through at a certain time so we

736
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:42,299
want lots of review but we're getting

737
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:45,450
closer question hey who need from Google

738
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:49,250
Public DNS so ioud there's a restriction

739
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:53,520
in the draft which says that the the

740
00:36:49,250 --> 00:37:02,160
root server is only accessible locally

741
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:03,809
yes that's also a title then

742
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,890
everything's not gonna be on the same

743
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:11,730
machine so is there some way to bird

744
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:13,348
that into the document are you saying

745
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,000
that you want a world it where it

746
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:17,220
doesn't have to be on the same machine

747
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,849
or to say we know that there's out

748
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,200
restriction so I think wording so that

749
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:23,970
it doesn't have to be on the same

750
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,399
machine I think the main point here

751
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,250
trying to get to is like you want to

752
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,890
limit access to the server I think if we

753
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:35,359
say that explicitly and allow running on

754
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:38,490
a non-local can you go back one slide so

755
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,170
the make the use case is explicit we're

756
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,759
gonna have that conversation that I was

757
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,250
hoping that no one would say that but

758
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,950
since you have that wording will cause

759
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,660
this so so it's not as simple as saying

760
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:52,379
oh let's just loosen this up because

761
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,430
that's why 7706 actually said it has to

762
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,770
run on localhost

763
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,348
we've expanded it off of running on

764
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,990
localhost but now saying oh it needs to

765
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:02,240
be closest yeah that may not work so

766
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:07,740
we'll have that discussion

767
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,209
thanks Jeff and I said in following

768
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,328
quite a fine question I'm not sure if

769
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,110
it's covered in 776 or in tentacle being

770
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:15,440
here

771
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:19,440
about if you get like your roots on the

772
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,380
TLD isn't there have an fix and s record

773
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,400
fix that there's a weird echo I'm not

774
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,200
understanding right

775
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,850
can you hear better now yeah I think so

776
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,279
um so my question is if you run this

777
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,560
locally or you know environment there

778
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,930
and every record under the roots on the

779
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,850
NS records have a TTL of two days but if

780
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,279
you ask child allegation can have the

781
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,420
different TTL value so if your clients

782
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,890
connect your server and our show

783
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,070
discover in this trap I don't think it

784
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,720
is but our sighting 706 but which TTL

785
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,100
we're going to return to your client the

786
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,580
one in the red zone other than the child

787
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,339
elevation we explicitly don't say how to

788
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,680
run your authoritative server so if you

789
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:02,010
run an authoritative server that lunges

790
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,430
TCL's or lies or whatever that's your

791
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:14,280
fault yeah like if a my client connected

792
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:15,980
oh I take that yes yeah and I've been

793
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,500
over there's a bunch of times

794
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:22,500
West Hart occur so I is I so i created

795
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,540
the local reprojected III and one

796
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,630
important thing to understand about a

797
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:32,970
local copy of the root and the way that

798
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:37,770
7706 works Thank You Warren really all

799
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:39,899
you came up here for one one important

800
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:43,380
concept of how the local root or the

801
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,020
hyper local route or 7706 works is that

802
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,440
it only answers authoritative Lee on the

803
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:52,980
address for as if it was the root server

804
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,800
so when it is answering for a TLD and

805
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,970
that saying you need to here's the NS

806
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,520
records set for the TLD properly

807
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,399
behaving resolvers will then go ask the

808
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:09,060
TLD what they think things should be and

809
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,340
if the TTL is very it should be and and

810
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,860
your paper nicely proves that that's not

811
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,170
always the case but it should be that

812
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:20,010
you believe the child's values as

813
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:22,350
authoritative a different the same

814
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,260
result but a different way to answer

815
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,069
that is to say this is no more

816
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,250
authoritative

817
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,410
than you asking an actual root server so

818
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:39,240
you will do exactly what you would have

819
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:42,210
done exactly yes okay thank you good so

820
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,930
not for this next version but for the

821
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,360
fiction

822
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,160
oh sorry but needs of it or suggested

823
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,230
another use case are you open for more

824
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,330
use case you're absolutely so I will

825
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,750
write up some of the use case stuff or

826
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,520
warn and I will write up soon yeah and

827
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:59,010
then we will ask for discussion on that

828
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,960
and if I didn't get it the way that who

829
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:03,270
need asked for or whatever or others

830
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,880
that will come right and there have been

831
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:09,540
other people who have asked for that

832
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,210
where local the definition of local

833
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,490
stretches well beyond what I would want

834
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,730
and I've said no on that but maybe we

835
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:22,049
can have something closer to local thank

836
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:25,200
you and we're still good yeah so this

837
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,730
one hopefully will be even shorter so I

838
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,870
have mentioned this at a previous one

839
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:34,020
but a bunch of people have questions or

840
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:37,290
have been wanting to have to not refer

841
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:39,300
to technologies we're working on now or

842
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,620
have worked on the past by their draft

843
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,240
name and by their RFC number so

844
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:48,810
terminology comes up and so this is a

845
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,330
draft with very limited updates to the

846
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:54,870
terminology document just for these next

847
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:57,090
slide so that came out smaller than I

848
00:41:54,870 --> 00:42:00,450
want but I think still readable this

849
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:02,930
just is those six terms at this point

850
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:05,609
the draft is just those six terms and

851
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:07,259
the reason why it's just those six terms

852
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,660
is that seems to be all of the terms

853
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,560
that people have sort of half agreed on

854
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,899
in this space it's not planned to be

855
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,360
let's open up terminology for all the

856
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,610
other new terminology it's just these

857
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,290
and these terms are not fixed and

858
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,640
something I mean this is a request to

859
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,050
have this become a working group talk

860
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,580
and people might want to change the

861
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,800
names they might want to change the

862
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:33,779
abbreviations that's all fine but the

863
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:36,270
idea is to have those in a document from

864
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,340
here next slide you want to take quizzes

865
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,990
they'll just finish the presentation do

866
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,880
I want to take

867
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,359
the question no no no the next slide is

868
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:50,360
basically so this is all we wanted now

869
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:54,119
we can have all of them George a penis I

870
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,520
say this every time you come up with the

871
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,070
dictionary the dictionary is good but it

872
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,110
will never be finished

873
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,480
you have to ship it you have to stop

874
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:08,430
accepting changes which you just said

875
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,600
for the love of God just just it is

876
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,940
agree I think it should be a working

877
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,960
group document I think it remain open

878
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,430
I'm sorry

879
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,590
you think it should remain oh it's

880
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:19,410
nicely made no no no the RFC is already

881
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:21,240
done these are additions - yeah I hope

882
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,460
you're gonna come back in the room with

883
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,680
another three in a year's time again and

884
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:30,540
again and again because my intended

885
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:42,180
retirement date with that third again so

886
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:43,619
I hope you're wrong okay so these are

887
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,149
the ones that are in the current version

888
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,770
of the draft before the working group

889
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,109
has adopted it if if it's gonna get

890
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,980
adopted right so to mediate these all

891
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:56,190
seem fine except the third one which is

892
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:59,970
53 because I'm really confused because

893
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:03,630
if if we calling DNS doe 53 and we

894
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:06,660
should call DNS over TLS doe 53 over TLS

895
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:09,600
so we could do that so far people have

896
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,220
used these terms and other drafts so I

897
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:17,490
thought that they were okay but we can

898
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:21,509
change them excuse me Brian Dixon

899
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:23,939
GoDaddy for the very last one ad D I'm

900
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:27,540
not sure whether I even want to open up

901
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,790
this can of worms but the last D in that

902
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:36,650
maybe we should put a little asterisks

903
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:41,160
to say any of those first for t TLS do H

904
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:45,150
53 or whatever ie we don't want

905
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,310
unnecessarily for a DB exclude 53 okay

906
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:50,390
so that's it this guy oh right yeah he

907
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,390
turned it on and everything

908
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,540
now it's blinding me but that's okay as

909
00:44:54,579 --> 00:45:00,040
well so we might we might not I think

910
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,290
that that's a reasonable working group

911
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,380
discussion I would suggest we don't do

912
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:09,779
to add new terms that have characters

913
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:13,210
like an asterisk in them but yeah

914
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,550
Giovani inside an um do 53

915
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:19,809
you mean like only UD beat what about

916
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:23,050
the DCP nope nope port 53 either it says

917
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:25,960
that explicitly yeah because because RFC

918
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:29,530
1034 and 10:35 say that explicitly as

919
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,480
well Tim with sinski I literally thought

920
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,339
that third one like this I've been doing

921
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:41,349
too much in the wrong place was Dinah's

922
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:43,029
over route 53 so right and so other

923
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:47,339
people in the room would would want us

924
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:49,690
to also add do eight which I don't

925
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:51,730
generate I think these definitions

926
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,589
you've got the same poll asked you know

927
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,760
and I disagree with the suggestion that

928
00:45:53,589 --> 00:46:00,730
we serve in DD with an asterisk

929
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,490
associated with it the ITF israeli seeds

930
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:05,589
that the EDD list is applications doing

931
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:10,740
de dns we should just stick with that

932
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:13,990
and not mess it up - neither isis

933
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,279
because quite frankly if going to what

934
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,450
George Michael sent begin unless you

935
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,549
want me to come up a couple years now

936
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:21,040
when there's another one if we restrict

937
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:22,030
it now you know let's not do that yeah I

938
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,220
think you're trying to get a document

939
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:29,079
the closest thing they're gonna keep

940
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:31,450
alive for them um I'm not familiar I

941
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:35,260
have a reservation about the last one

942
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:38,890
odd first odd is the only one which is

943
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,650
not defined in RFC all the rest are what

944
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:46,750
are called clearly defined with RFC ad

945
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:48,309
is a vague concept second definition of

946
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:51,309
what is an application what is the

947
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:53,290
system can be clear in some cases for in

948
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,720
UNIX for instance it's quite clear but

949
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:58,599
it can be different in other system on

950
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,069
third I observe that currently we have

951
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,200
added mailing list

952
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:04,779
the name comes from application doing

953
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,660
DNS on the list is going in

954
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,300
many directions most of them unrelated

955
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,910
to application doing DNS we will talk

956
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,370
about that at the box tomorrow but today

957
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:21,490
it seems to me that unlike the others

958
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:22,930
odd is very mmm Jodi so this is just the

959
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:26,229
list the draft actually has the

960
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:28,870
definitions if the definition seems to

961
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,700
scoochie for you I agree we should nail

962
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,020
it down and if it doesn't seem like we

963
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,730
can nail it down I think it's reasonable

964
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,550
to take it out it's just that many

965
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:39,460
people have been using that because of

966
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:43,000
the problem where people say dough is

967
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:45,220
bad because of X and X would apply just

968
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,270
as easily if an application was doing G

969
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:51,730
ot so you know a DV the whole idea was

970
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:54,490
it's the a that's important here or not

971
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,960
not the other two if we can get that

972
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,120
right great and if we can't get it right

973
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:03,870
we should not add it to to the

974
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:08,529
terminology list I agree okay thank you

975
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:12,759
yeah before leaving not answering my

976
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:14,710
George Michaels question but we still

977
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:24,520
have decided and eNOS of working group

978
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:27,220
document or not right no oh no I didn't

979
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,780
even say I'm sorry I meant to because I

980
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,540
thought that was what this was about is

981
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,220
that certainly anyone updating that RFC

982
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,020
should be a working group discussion

983
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,279
here I think yeah so it might as well be

984
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,740
a working group list but if people don't

985
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,600
want it that's fine I just I just think

986
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,939
that people are using these definitions

987
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,640
enough where it would be good to

988
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:50,980

989
