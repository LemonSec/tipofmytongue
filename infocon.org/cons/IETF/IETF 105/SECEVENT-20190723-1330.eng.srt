1
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,829
Anabelle when's Amazon gonna have a

2
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:51,659
kindle that's us BC turkey isn't this

3
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,659
fun that I can ask these questions now

4
00:00:53,999 --> 00:01:44,010
your cat Amazon don't you anyone not

5
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,010
filled in the blue sign the blue feet

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,830
now there's somebody hiding behind the

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,830
post intentionally or unintentionally

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:17,880
there's lots of chairs right up here at

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:29,250
the front of the class well why don't we

10
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:30,600
get started there's note well and if

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,330
anybody thinks is something that I

12
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,329
forgot to do feel free to remind me

13
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:49,800
here's a agenda anybody have feedback on

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:53,640
the agenda of course mike has left the

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:03:01,950
room would you like to go first

16
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:04,738
Annabelle or you want to wait for yeah

17
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,899
yeah we were in the agenda review part

18
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:19,200
of the agenda and now we're proposing to

19
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:20,730
change the order of the agenda well I

20
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,709
think we might have to wait a bit this

21
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,709
room I managed

22
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,349
[Music]

23
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,749
[Music]

24
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:31,610
the Mao Scrolls wrong way which is very

25
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:42,650
confusing maybe but I don't know though

26
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:48,080
here you go that might work yes it is on

27
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,219
now okay Wow okay um my name is n Belle

28
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,020
Becker and I'm here to talk about

29
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,479
subject identifiers for security event

30
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,599
tokens shockingly exactly what is on the

31
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,599
slide

32
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:12,510
okay I'm gonna need you to scroll

33
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:15,000
because that that is a big no and I

34
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,590
I'm just gonna have have our wonderful

35
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,320
chair here scroll for me

36
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,669
okay subject identifier z' we've been

37
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,670
through this before but for anybody

38
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:27,240
who's unfamiliar with this work the goal

39
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:29,280
is to define lightweight schemas for the

40
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,600
various ways that we might identify a

41
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,630
subject be it by email or phone number

42
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,590
or issue or in subject pair or any

43
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:44,159
number of other things so the the spec

44
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,830
defines the format for defining these

45
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,490
schemas and then defines a few of them

46
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:55,919
in the the spec itself and defines Ayana

47
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:58,350
registry for that work next just to give

48
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,470
it add some clarity here's an example of

49
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,910
one of these things in action in a risk

50
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,270
subject event

51
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,460
excuse me security event token you see

52
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,909
it in this particular example we have a

53
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,280
subject identifier of the issuer subject

54
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,680
type it has a subject type field saying

55
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,539
what type it is and then it has a couple

56
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,990
of claims the meaning of which are

57
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:29,160
defined in the the spec so where we at

58
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:34,350
just published draft number four it is

59
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,420
in use in the RISC spec that is being

60
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,430
worked on in open ID foundations risk

61
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,750
working group Google and Amazon are both

62
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,840
working on implementations and

63
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,450
interoperability on this it's pretty

64
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:54,030
much where we've been at for a while

65
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:56,219
next a couple of two small updates and

66
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,590
one more significant update here there

67
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,690
was some concern over identify our

68
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,429
correlation and should we have some text

69
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,640
in this document about that so we added

70
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,530
that to privacy considerations I'm not

71
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,300
going to go into the specifics of that

72
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,809
you can look at the draft and read the

73
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,520
paragraph

74
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:17,520
next has anybody read the latest draft

75
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:31,120
okay does anyone read the draft before

76
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:33,070
lab Thanks does anyone have questions

77
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,290
about this sir would like a Hannah bell

78
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:39,909
to go on we we we have a fair amount of

79
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:47,560
time if there's not interested we'll

80
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:50,169
continue on okay good next the next

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,820
notable change is that we added language

82
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:57,849
to prohibit nesting aliases what that

83
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,800
means to we added this type subject

84
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,360
identifier type called aliases the

85
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:07,660
purpose of this is to allow you to

86
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,419
include multiple identifiers for the

87
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:15,220
same subject so this is particularly

88
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:22,560
useful in cases where it's unclear how

89
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:24,850
the intended audience of say set is

90
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,160
identifying the subject or knows how to

91
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,710
identify the subject and so you want to

92
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,750
send a couple of identifiers x' the sort

93
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:36,069
of canonical example where this is

94
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:41,349
useful is in cases of like open ID

95
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:45,040
connect Federation on the web where a an

96
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:48,940
issuer and an open ID provider might

97
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,069
send an ID token with email address and

98
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,680
issuer in subject and maybe phone number

99
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,570
and who knows what else

100
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,120
ideally the client is using issuer and

101
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,920
subject to identify the subject and

102
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,320
they're storing that in their database

103
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,270
but they don't always do that sometimes

104
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,890
they just map based on email address we

105
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,210
don't want them to do that but that's

106
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,699
what people do in practice

107
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,460
so this gives a way for the issue or if

108
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,700
they're sending a set to include

109
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,410
multiple identifiers so that the

110
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,600
recipient is gonna be able to figure out

111
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,990
who they're talking about even if they

112
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,020
didn't do the right thing

113
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,850
um that's what aliases is for this

114
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,699
update just makes it so you're not going

115
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,709
to have aliases nested and aliases

116
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,240
nested and aliases have this like nested

117
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:34,040
list structure that doesn't make any

118
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,570
sense and doesn't have any meaning so

119
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,569
we're just gonna say let's not do that

120
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:52,370
next do we have a jabber comment do you

121
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,020
have a jabber comment bjorn Kim asks if

122
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,730
there's a reason why the claim value for

123
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,949
the phone number is just phone as

124
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,020
opposed to like phone underscore number

125
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,580
because a phone might just be like the

126
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,160
physical hardware object that has its

127
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,470
own identifier as opposed to the number

128
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,160
itself so just to make sure I understand

129
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:15,020
a question we're asking why is the Navy

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,480
the attribute name phone used instead of

131
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:21,800
phone underscore number or are we

132
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:24,260
talking about the name for the the

133
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,359
subject identifier type or maybe we're

134
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,939
talking about both we might be talking

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,000
about both that sounded like the okay

136
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,240
that's a fair question the answer is

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,940
because phone is shorter but if there

138
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,700
are concerns about ambiguity there I

139
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,820
don't see a compelling reason not to

140
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:48,279
change that if like if there's a

141
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,279
legitimate ambiguity concerned then sure

142
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,870
to this point about existing practice

143
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,410
the open ID connect user info claim is

144
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:04,329
phone underscore number that's a good

145
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:06,850
reason to change it any other question

146
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:10,089
this before you move on to the third and

147
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,920
final change nice I got screwed up okay

148
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,350
so this one is a little bit more

149
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,339
substantial there was some discussion

150
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:22,329
last meeting about the need for a jock

151
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:26,709
claim for including a subject identifier

152
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:30,638
in a job the idea here is that John

153
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:33,939
defines the sub claim which is defined

154
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,100
just as a string which is great for open

155
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,689
ID Connect we're like that's defined and

156
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,119
open ID Connect that's how you identify

157
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,939
a subject but it's not so great in other

158
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:47,649
scenarios where you have a more complex

159
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:50,259
representation of a subject so what we

160
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,999
did in this draft is we added this sub

161
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:56,499
underscore ID this definition for this

162
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:58,509
sub underscore ID jot claim the language

163
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:00,369
I have there is copied from the text

164
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,110
it's a subject identifier that

165
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:04,509
identifies the principal that is the

166
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,239
subject of the jaw and that underscore

167
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:10,059
or that underlined portion there is

168
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:14,049
copied from the definition of the sub

169
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:18,429
claim in jaw itself so the intention

170
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:21,549
here is that both of these claims sub

171
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:23,889
and sub ID are going to point to the

172
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:25,509
same subject the same principle you

173
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:27,989
can't have one pointing to one thing in

174
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:30,129
one pointing to another that would be

175
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:32,049
against that would be a violation of the

176
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:37,329
spec and there's language in the spec to

177
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:39,429
that effect so at the bottom here we

178
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,859
have an example kind of the simple case

179
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:43,600
of I just have a sub ID on the next

180
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,989
couple slides I've got some other

181
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:57,100
examples of how sub and sub ID interact

182
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:59,259
with one another so the jaw can have sub

183
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,309
it cannot have saw that kind of sub idea

184
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:02,230
cannot have sub ID

185
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:04,738
both of these can exist at the same time

186
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,809
you can have a job with neither of them

187
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:09,160
if they both exist as I said earlier if

188
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:11,319
they're both present in the same job

189
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,949
they have to point to the same principle

190
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:17,449
if you put sub and sub ID in the same

191
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:19,099
job you are making a statement that the

192
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:24,050
these identifiers point to the same

193
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,760
principle that said that doesn't mean

194
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,990
they have to necessarily have the same

195
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,930
value for example that in this example I

196
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,090
have one where the issuer is using an

197
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:42,380
email address to identify the subject in

198
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:44,330
the subclavian there the intention here

199
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,410
what that subject type should say is

200
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:50,840
email in the sub ID claim they are

201
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,240
specifying an email subject identifier

202
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,300
but it is a different email for the

203
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,520
subject so effectively that the the

204
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,930
issuer here is saying both of these

205
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:06,800
email addresses actually point to the

206
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:09,680
same subject no we do have a new type of

207
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,699
subject type s using it an account

208
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,969
subject identifier type that was added

209
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:22,660
in version 3 I believe that Mike

210
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,660
suggestion that uses account your eyes

211
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:35,150
[Laughter]

212
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:37,550
that would be the next slide yes

213
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,500
so yep the another option is you could

214
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,520
have completely different types that

215
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,050
you're using in each of these fields the

216
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,860
in this case again the subject the

217
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,329
subclade

218
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,910
an email address the sub ID claim is

219
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:59,930
identifying the subject by an account

220
00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:02,959
URI for some particular service benedick

221
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,729
just for myself so freezing mist like

222
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,070
you know the issuer is making an

223
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,990
assertion that the principal of the

224
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,340
subject or the principal identified by

225
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,020
the subject the principal identified

226
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,300
when the subject ID are the same

227
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,670
principal that's sort of gives me a

228
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,069
little bit of pause because now when I

229
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,020
receive that assertion am I allowed to

230
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,210
use that assertion and to use that

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,060
information only in the context of

232
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,770
processing this jot or this yeah this

233
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,989
job or am I allowed to use that in

234
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,899
arbitrary contexts New York completely

235
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,540
unrelated

236
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,790
that would be subject to the data

237
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,709
sharing agreements and privacy

238
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:47,759
agreements that you have with the

239
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:49,829
transmitter of that set any other

240
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,199
questions on on that before we move on I

241
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:54,269
think I've got another couple slides on

242
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,639
on this particular piece do you want to

243
00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:00,809
maybe elaborate why it's important

244
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:04,410
sure so the question was if a

245
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:07,410
transmitter is by including sub and sub

246
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,749
ID in a job if that's making an

247
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,829
assertion that those to identify as

248
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:17,279
point to the same principle then the

249
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:18,540
recipient of that job then can you can

250
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,059
correlate those two identifiers

251
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,029
basically say okay I I have records for

252
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:26,309
the sub I have records for a sub ID

253
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:30,629
I know these now relate to the together

254
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:33,360
relate to the same principle that is

255
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:34,529
something that you know governing that

256
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,499
or regulating that I think is something

257
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,749
outside the scope of the spec but the

258
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:42,540
spec does that's going back to the I

259
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:45,629
jennife identifiers correlation language

260
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,839
that was added that's where we try and

261
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:52,110
address those concerns and point out

262
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,600
that hey if you are sharing structures

263
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,300
that have multiple subject identifiers

264
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,879
in them make sure you are only doing

265
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,939
that in cases where it's going to be

266
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,500
okay for you to for that recipient to

267
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:09,688
know that those two identifiers where a

268
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,630
like together that's why the the ID

269
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:15,299
token example that I gave earlier is a

270
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,089
good one because they're the issuer

271
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:21,089
knows that they've previously sent these

272
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,559
identifiers to the recipient so they

273
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,799
know if the recipient can already

274
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,340
correlate those so sending them together

275
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:36,629
in another context doesn't give the

276
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:39,449
recipient more information so another

277
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,550
context where this sub ID claim gets a

278
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,670
little interesting is when we think

279
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:50,250
about the interplay between the issuer

280
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:56,000
of the of the jock and the issuer in the

281
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,000
issuer / subject subject identifier type

282
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:06,379
these values may or may not be the same

283
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:10,620
it is possible for a job to be issued by

284
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:13,680
entity a but use and a subject

285
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,310
identifier where the issuer is entity B

286
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,730
and a good example of this is shown here

287
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:24,750
where in this case we have a John being

288
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,040
issued by a client and they're using the

289
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:32,640
issuer subject subject identifier type

290
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:36,659
to indicate that the subject is based

291
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,490
off is defined relative to the issuer so

292
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,990
you we can imagine this happening in an

293
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:45,600
open ID Connect relationship where a the

294
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,870
issuer has provided some subject

295
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,760
identifiers via an ID token the client

296
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,919
wants to communicate some information

297
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,870
back up to the issuer via a jot the only

298
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,610
shared identifier they have is the one

299
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:06,870
that the the issuer communicated in in

300
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:09,479
the ID token it would be incorrect to

301
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:12,780
just take that subject from that ID

302
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,070
token and put it in the jot the client

303
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,340
is sending because then it would say

304
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,110
issuer his client and subject is this

305
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,209
identifier that's defined relative to

306
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,949
the issuer which would be incorrect so

307
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,190
this gives us a way around that problem

308
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,750
gives us a way to clearly specify that

309
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,210
we have one entity that's make it that's

310
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,730
issuing this John but we're identifying

311
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:40,419
it using an identifier issued from in

312
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:42,669
this case actually the recipient so

313
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:45,669
this point I think we only won one

314
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,399
concern raised about phone number but

315
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:52,019
other than that we're looking for

316
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:53,979
feedback on subject ID and if there's a

317
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,679
anything else people think are is

318
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,090
missing from the spec at this point you

319
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:04,080
can don't have any other open items

320
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,080
right now so open to feedback there

321
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,999
Brian Campbell pain as the one who had

322
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,399
actually originally raised the question

323
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:19,230
about whether or not to do a claim here

324
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:22,449
I saw this without it read through it I

325
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,820
like it I appreciate it thank you the

326
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,249
only one question I did have is and I

327
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:32,369
don't know that it's germane here but I

328
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:35,470
think that the risk working group uses

329
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:38,949
subject spelled out throughout like all

330
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,019
their messages and I'm I honestly don't

331
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,169
know if that's a if they're using it as

332
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:47,919
a top-level claim or like more nested

333
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:51,340
stuff and if if there's any potential

334
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:57,539
issue between a mismatch then right so

335
00:20:51,340 --> 00:21:01,959
the risk working group defines a subject

336
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:05,230
claim within the event payload so it's

337
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,980
not at the job level so we you that

338
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:15,279
could arguably be replaced by sub ID and

339
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:17,379
and shift that up to to the Javal that

340
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,700
yeah that's something that the working

341
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:20,769
group hasn't really looked at hasn't

342
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,230
really considered but there's no there's

343
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,570
no inherent conflict than anyway sensor

344
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,320
there was right I guess there wouldn't

345
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:33,428
be right there's no right I believe the

346
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,279
risk spec already says that the subject

347
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:37,480
of the event and/or our set might say

348
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:40,570
that actually that the subject of the

349
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:44,320
event and the subject of the of the set

350
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,200
are the same so there shouldn't be any

351
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,730
conflict there it would just be another

352
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,470
case of the subject specified and the

353
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,280
event payload points to the same if

354
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,840
there is a sub I

355
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,899
it points to the same principle as that

356
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,820
I think one of the strategies that was

357
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,310
discussed or patterns that was discussed

358
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,919
with inset was that specs that are

359
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:08,379
profiling the set should you know go

360
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,950
hog-wild within the event payload but

361
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:16,000
kind of stay away from the the jaw level

362
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,320
of the set the the kind of container so

363
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,290
for that reason it may make sense for

364
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:28,060
for risk to keep their subject in the

365
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:38,820
event pay letter yeah any other

366
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:41,080
questions or our feedback did read it so

367
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,590
the people that have read it there's

368
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:49,320
Brian anybody else that's read it I

369
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,320
think Phil raised his hand did he okay

370
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,710
from Acosta's point of view van with a

371
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,050
me with should I go and see whether

372
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:04,780
people are ready to put this to a last

373
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:08,490
call to the list or okay anyone opposed

374
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:15,250
to it going to last call to the list

375
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:17,410
no one can I get some people to

376
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,550
volunteer to review it so we've got a

377
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,820
number of other people a little bit it

378
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,820
might

379
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:33,390
and get a couple more if I periodically

380
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,870
poke you I'm gonna be gonna type that

381
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:47,940
into those will you type that in the

382
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:52,889
minutes yes I'm just gonna leave that

383
00:23:47,940 --> 00:24:00,510
one alone anything else um no that's all

384
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:21,720
I got for this okay thank you Mike are

385
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:23,850
you ready well I intend to use the rest

386
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,789
of the time with this presentation but

387
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:31,139
we'll see how it goes

388
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:34,169
next so this is a slide that I've had

389
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,760
for about a year what is the pole draft

390
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:40,649
it's a counterpart to the push draft

391
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,879
enabling it to be used in contexts where

392
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:47,370
you can't use push next so what's

393
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,059
happened since we last met our heroes in

394
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,949
Prague we published a new revision where

395
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:57,990
I did what I said but I would do which

396
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:02,070
was go through the push Draft find text

397
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:04,740
that appeared to be applicable to the

398
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,889
pawl draft and either incorporated

399
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,279
directly if it was descriptive or if it

400
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:14,580
was normative I changed to reference it

401
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:18,179
rather than duplicate it so we finished

402
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:23,820
aligning the descriptive text there were

403
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:25,559
no normative changes next so this is how

404
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,830
I intend to use the rest of the time

405
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:31,050
this is my last slide

406
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,230
I believe we're ready for working group

407
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:36,930
last call but that's the decision of the

408
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,230
chairs in the working group has anyone

409
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:43,140
read the drop that Mike pushed out two

410
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:48,890
weeks ago listen Annabel okay

411
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:54,870
sorry I see anybody else hiding behind

412
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:57,750
anybody no not much actually changed bet

413
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,750
there were some normative references

414
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:07,830
made to the pall draft rather than

415
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:17,600
duplicating text anyone opposed to 2011

416
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:20,100
all on the list for no okay on the

417
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,540
subject I an affair Annabel you're gonna

418
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:26,879
make the change of the label okay when

419
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:42,620
can you have that pushed out right away

420
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:45,240
soon okay so when we get that right away

421
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:56,969
we can call last fall on the left two

422
00:26:45,240 --> 00:27:05,070
items yeah you have anything else I

423
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:07,590
guess I relinquished the time so the

424
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,470
last item on our agenda was to see if

425
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:23,010
there's any other work that people have

426
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:26,580
proposed for this working group no well

427
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:29,280
assuming that nothing happens in net

428
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:33,629
that our last fall's go smoothly and

429
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:38,570
people respond on the list I don't know

430
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:38,570
that we even need a session next yeah

431
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:55,769
yeah it seems like we're in pretty good

432
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:58,739
shape I know that the the push Draft has

433
00:27:55,769 --> 00:28:02,219
been with me for longer than it should

434
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:05,159
have a couple months but I had a pretty

435
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:07,139
busy personal life so all of my IETF

436
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,119
time was like working on the telly chap

437
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:14,519
prep and so I haven't gotten much in the

438
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:17,069
publication requested documents from the

439
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,629
organ groups but I'm back and I'm

440
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:22,289
catching up on that so I think I will

441
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:24,178
get to the push in probably another few

442
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:26,609
weeks and start getting things moving

443
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,989
again so okay great

444
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,399
sorry it's because when we get to that

445
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:31,259
we'll probably have the poll on the

446
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,478
subject already for you yeah yeah it

447
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,609
should be a SD queued up I can have both

448
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,899
right there I could do do the side by

449
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:47,249
side which would be actually quite nice

450
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:50,569
okay thanks Ben any other items any

451
