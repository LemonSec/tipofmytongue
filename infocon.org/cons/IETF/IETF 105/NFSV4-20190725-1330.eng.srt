6
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,469
more jokes about our

7
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,590

of us be working group had 150 F it

15
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,230
means the nfsv4 working group has been

16
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:17,669
going on since the early 60s now we have

17
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:22,988
an agenda here let me go through it

18
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:25,449
first topic is with Dave Novick on minor

19
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:28,359
protocol updates that your document is

20
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,729
called update stan FS right or something

21
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:35,439
like that

22
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:38,459
RPC over TLS the Chuck Lieber integrity

23
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:43,030
measurement Chuck leave are already ma

24
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:46,629
Chuck Lieber milestone of you web which

25
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,150
will have to be done a lot I was looking

26
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:52,090
at Dave slides there they're good to get

27
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,900
our discussion going on our milestone we

28
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,079
have we'd you have to update the

29
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,040
milestones and and Magnus will be paying

30
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,389
attention to that section

31
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:09,489
definitely the five sixty six five six

32
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:13,299
six one this Dave Novak and then no and

33
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:15,069
then saurons up with saurons up with a

34
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,418
discussion on data reduction extended

35
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,399
attributes I thought that's discussions

36
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:22,630
been going on since we got in the room

37
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:25,710
so let's uh let's let's let's just reach

38
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,770
closure on that and then we added a

39
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,539
delegation of state IDs of Tom Haines

40
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,580
that was added

41
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:50,080
just now so as there any other changes

42
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:51,219
to the agenda anybody care okay now you

43
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:59,800
want to do it you want to do that after

44
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:04,630
that right that's funny yeah you want to

45
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,840
have tomorrow something okay okay it I

46
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,840
did it

47
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,180
if anybody is online they have they have

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,979
at least put the NFS before working

49
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,830
group at the farthest possible

50
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:38,560
conference room from the center of the

51
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:39,820
IETF as possible this is no tomatoes

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,000
okay

53
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,980
the and then you every time you come in

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,870
here you sign when you register and you

55
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,470
get your little agenda you have a note

56
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:55,000
well on it it's a continuously evolving

57
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,790
small note by the way but it basically

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,850
the more important things are you you're

59
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,700
participating it's me recording perhaps

60
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:07,150
or taking minutes and you're allowing a

61
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,010
lot to take place and the other thing is

62
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,359
that if you wear of any IETF

63
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,469
contribution is covered by patents or

64
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,820
patent applications that are owned or

65
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,540
controlled by you your sponsor

66
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,010
you must disclose that fact or not

67
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,840
participate in the discussion so I guess

68
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,820
that means bolt from the room which

69
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:33,090
would be a very telling movement during

70
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:33,090
a discussion I guess but huh okay

71
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:46,280
okay Oh welcome Rainier welcome to renzo

72
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,810
so you know I actually do look at the

73
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,909
note well every time I come to an IETF

74
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,250
BT because it does change meeting to

75
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,610
meeting to take a look at it but the

76
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,980
core of it is the same all right let's

77
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,160
start so we decided to keep the agenda

78
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:06,230
in the order it is I believe overriding

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,500
Chuck's suggestion that's okay so let's

80
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:19,010
do it

81
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:22,330
Dave and then you'll be able to see the

82
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,330
slides on the TV right here

83
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:40,280
well it's okay sure oh okay so I want to

84
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:44,000
talk about on the X all right yeah okay

85
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,859
so anyway talk we've made some updates

86
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,150
some of that should have gone through

87
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,860
and some of them in the process of going

88
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,960
through I want to talk about both the

89
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:57,350
updates to both be for dotto and before

90
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,750
that one yeah I'm almost working almost

91
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,280
yeah all right yeah I'm gonna you're

92
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:25,490
gonna hit the thing and I'm gonna just

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:31,099
adjusted what'd she look like a little

94
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:32,750
go back sure all right all right okay so

95
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,400
the before the no changes are limited to

96
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:40,220
truckin we had a trunking discovery and

97
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,728
that it actually has been published I

98
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:46,190
don't know what you know Chuck did he

99
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:50,120
got it oh he got it through the icy ice

100
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,680
yes she did not stop him before that one

101
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,279
a tougher story and I'm going to talk

102
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,920
about my travails about that so we had a

103
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,060
trunking discovery and transparent state

104
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,569
migration to be 4.1 we transparent state

105
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,859
migration had been done for data and X

106
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,980
number of people bothered me about

107
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,260
making sure that 4.1 was at the same

108
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,420
level so this was not published yet as

109
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,819
an RFC and that's a long story and

110
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,920
that's most of this talk and it's kind

111
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,480
of sad but then we I think we need to

112
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,029
have an implementation discussion about

113
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,970
what's happening with prototyping and

114
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:32,570
getting these stuff to actually actually

115
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:36,260
in the field alright so before to know

116
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,279
we ended trunking we're more trunking to

117
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:43,970
be for to know it the history of is that

118
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:46,040
originally in RFC 35 30 and sent

119
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:51,170
festered a trunking was the sort of bad

120
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:53,180
thing to avoid and with RFC 7931 we loud

121
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,819
you haven't rung people if we got to say

122
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,650
well you can if you have two addresses

123
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,150
you can figure out whether they're

124
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,920
trunked or not but there was no way I

125
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,449
said oh I haven't addressed what other

126
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,949
dress is trunk with that so that was

127
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:11,870
that was trunking discovery in addition

128
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:14,990
to trucking detection so in in the v4

129
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,360
know Chuck's document defined the

130
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,500
interaction of trunking migration even

131
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,630
support you know trunking discovery in

132
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,150
trunking you can have two things that

133
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,589
work trunk also become not trunk you can

134
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,420
have things migrant didn't wedding

135
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,900
things in my grade you can migrate from

136
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,760
from from two trunk things to one to one

137
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,189
pattern on the other thing or the vice

138
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,470
versus and that's all support this was

139
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,650
published as propose sandal it actually

140
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,700
happened by the milestone date although

141
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,250
i don't know what the definition of

142
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:52,310
final submission is but anyway it's

143
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:54,860
publicist RFC anyway now for beef

144
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,739
one we had more to do we had to add

145
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,560
trunking discovery just as we did in

146
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,660
before to also discover trunky migration

147
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,109
that's that's physical parallels what's

148
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,569
in for dodo and also transparent and had

149
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,279
they had transparent state migration so

150
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,010
that was a bigger job that made that

151
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:16,540
document kind of enormous and because

152
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:20,600
some things we asked gene well it was

153
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,579
600 pages yes that's right all right so

154
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,660
we had and at session migration and the

155
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,490
fact that I have because you have

156
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,770
migration you can have migration of PN

157
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,020
FS metadata server migration of

158
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,180
possibility of migrating from P n FS

159
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,000
turn on pain of ascend and back in okay

160
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,260
so that's those things and also because

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,480
of the need to do these things there's

162
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,980
unnecessary cleanup first of all the way

163
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,220
the term replica was used in in RFC 56

164
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,750
61 B basically they said if you have two

165
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,270
different addresses they were treated as

166
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,680
as well as two different replicas even

167
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,279
though there really were actually two

168
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,819
paths to one replica so because that

169
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,670
there's some terminological cleanup that

170
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,880
had to be done and also the head event

171
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,829
handling because I think truck Chuck

172
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,300
pointed out that you know we weren't

173
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:13,310
very clear about the alternative you

174
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,900
don't support transparent state

175
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,900
penetration there are there are the

176
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:21,260
vague references to Pro FS / FS grace

177
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:24,140
periods but the lot of a lot of the code

178
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,870
a lot of the text did not really feel

179
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,310
that a lot of gaps there had to be at so

180
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,210
I revised the description of to ops

181
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,890
exchange ID the free exchange I think

182
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,780
but not was consistent with state

183
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,330
migration and reclaimed complete wasn't

184
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,970
clear about the / f / FS grace period

185
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,709
case so also there was cleanup of the

186
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,750
era decision to accommodate those things

187
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,540
anyway that was that was the package of

188
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,990
things I had to do in before that one

189
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,980
what useless well I'll go through that

190
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:58,779
all that sad story okay the first thing

191
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:05,000
is I produced this document that was

192
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:06,410
basically it was called draft ITF and if

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,260
it's before

194
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:15,709
M v1 m SS m s NS update and the paradigm

195
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:18,140
we filed was here the updates

196
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,900
replace this by this replaced that by

197
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:25,610
something else and I thought it was

198
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,100
clear or as well as I could be and I was

199
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,170
ok during the working group last call I

200
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,160
attempt last call and then the ad review

201
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:35,930
and that and but when the is G took a

202
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,520
look at that number of people said oh we

203
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:43,699
don't like this this sucks

204
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:47,329
and so I well I think they had a point

205
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,830
but anyway that wasn't the Exide we

206
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,030
decided that wasn't named we couldn't

207
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,590
there's no way that we'd get them to

208
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:57,530
accept that yes so Chuck leaver Oracle I

209
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:01,370
think the gist was with my document it

210
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:05,990
was short enough that the the diff I

211
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:08,740
loved that we used to update the

212
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,150
document was brief enough that it wasn't

213
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,770
bothersome and the problem was this

214
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,680
document was like three times longer

215
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,840
than mine and I got three I think we

216
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,250
crossed a line here it wasn't the it

217
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,900
wasn't the problem that you know we

218
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,700
don't like to hear the updates to apply

219
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,840
at the spec paradigm I think they didn't

220
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:30,500
like the size of it okay sure that that

221
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,480
yeah the they hear the updates paradigm

222
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,540
combine with you know you know eighty

223
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,330
pages of it that I think that's what I

224
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,400
see that's alright so anyway so he

225
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,260
needed more bits like document but I

226
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,709
started looking for the focuses and

227
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,200
where we were and Tom sort of indicate

228
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,930
oh gee you're crazy to do that basically

229
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,370
something that words that of the nines

230
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,640
of those exact words but that was the

231
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:59,000
idea so I settled on something that

232
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:03,530
would be closer to a BIST document it

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,180
basically replaced section 11 and just

234
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,640
add a few other updates I thought that

235
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,520
would be okay the is you still did not

236
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,689
like that

237
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,040
they want an even more bits like

238
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,670
document but a focus you have 8178 you

239
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,769
had issues with eighty-four RFC 84 34

240
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,439
ending

241
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:24,480
nationalisation security I'll talk about

242
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:27,540
that in the later talk so finally

243
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,819
settled on a partial miss document that

244
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,199
will be a bit in the sense that will

245
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:36,748
obsolete RFC 56 61 but it won't be the

246
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:43,170
best that address every progresses every

247
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:47,179
problem in RFC 56 61 and I so no other

248
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:49,979
changes other than the namespace changes

249
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,920
so I have that document that vacuum is

250
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:58,589
called draft ifgf NF is before our RFC

251
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:01,229
51 Cecily MS NS it submitted I hope

252
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,329
people will read it comment on that and

253
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,189
I think it needs to go through we're

254
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,290
grew last call and then we can get

255
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:10,738
considered by the ASG I'd like people to

256
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,719
look at it you could it's 600 pages but

257
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:15,509
I don't think if you should be read 600

258
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,100
pages you can it's it's it's close

259
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:24,089
enough to RFC 5060 one that you can dip

260
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,629
the 50 things and there's some bugs in

261
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,720
in RFC DIF that try to get the the

262
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:34,939
author RFC DIF to fix but somehow we had

263
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:39,829
some email problems communicating now I

264
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,829
have a few things changes I also have a

265
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:47,040
aquaria been katak about what he wants

266
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:49,949
to see as the reference VFS hopefully

267
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,089
hear from him the list any changes I get

268
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:55,740
in probably in the next week week or so

269
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,079
I'll submit it don't one and then we'll

270
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,009
see whether we can go to the working

271
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
group last call on that

272
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:03,329
after that I hope to move the document

273
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,529
forward and that's the only path eyes I

274
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:08,178
see on that document all right that's it

275
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:10,490
all right

276
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,870
okay implementation issues now

277
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,370
particularly with regard to trunking we

278
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:17,609
would like to get started an implication

279
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:20,489
implementation now I think the work on

280
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:24,839
before now is published and 400 and 1

281
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,669
and for the one handling of of trunking

282
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,950
is pretty much the same so I think the

283
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:31,590
work that you do on one would carry over

284
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,980
to the others but I find that some of

285
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,320
the people in this group are

286
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,280
right now said Oh before those all you

287
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,649
don't want to bother with it

288
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,629
but give it the same in both maybe the

289
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,260
same work would do I'd like to have that

290
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,830
discussion if you have some feelings

291
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,950
about when they would be doing the

292
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,678
drunken politician so the question is if

293
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,200
it's as big do you think that this time

294
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,350
will pass or maybe you should have a

295
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,790
small document to give to ig so they see

296
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,980
the differences maybe I don't know

297
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,159
because it seems to me that the same

298
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,320
society pages could be still a problem

299
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,990
well I wasn't I asked that question but

300
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:23,049
Magnusson he said don't bother you

301
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:24,000
though but I know what they're not so -

302
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,620
Aslam

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,960
yeah I mean we have discussed it I have

304
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,739
notified them and I even talked to you

305
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,690
around this about the some of the

306
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:40,600
implications I think what they should I

307
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,850
mean I this image or that is D that

308
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,399
seems to be liking this own a video

309
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:49,178
updates you should see so you can just

310
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:54,040
if it etc I may be not as convinced as

311
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:55,900
the others but now I mean this is the

312
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,770
plan we go forward with this as full-out

313
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,559
basically

314
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:03,040
implementing the full updates in in in

315
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:06,160
the full quarters document and that

316
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,020
becomes the next then reference and then

317
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,460
of if you're gonna do a four point one

318
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,110
piece forward if that would happen yeah

319
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,980
I know what I would like to see but

320
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,120
that's yeah it's coming o matic so but

321
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,660
we'll discuss that later that's a

322
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,040
separate topic but for for this

323
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,150
implement is I think we take it one step

324
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,370
its timing dementing I think I mean

325
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,990
clear smaller updates or the saying this

326
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,780
is an extension to something which isn't

327
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,169
existing that you can do still do a

328
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,940
system alone so yeah if you have new

329
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:44,740
functionality yes do that's a separate

330
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,610
talk no saying this extends the the 56

331
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,740
61 biz

332
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,240
what is it now and the other namespaces

333
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:57,380
but what really kind of a core reference

334
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,370
in the next steps okay so my so we'll

335
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,870
just see what happens

336
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:05,120
yeah all right all right

337
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,280
as far as implementation I think I'd

338
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,139
like like to know what people are doing

339
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,850
as far as implementation of trunking

340
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,790
Chuck do Univ it no I have any on the

341
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:25,719
client-side or what your plans are or do

342
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:25,720
you have plans Chuck leaverton Oracle I

343
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,090
I don't know of anything in specific I'm

344
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,409
just trying to collect my thoughts about

345
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:38,629
this I think one problem is that nobody

346
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:44,360
has implemented at this locations info

347
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:46,150
which is a good chunk of the appending

348
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,490
document that we were just discussing

349
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,470
ash isn't that big you could although

350
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,570
that is supported and there was it's

351
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,669
supported and there should be supported

352
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:59,059
if you even if you do FS the locations

353
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:00,919
right well there are some things in the

354
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:05,840
new document that talk about you know

355
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:08,000
combining the use of TCP and RDA and yes

356
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,270
the use of the our team a flag and

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,850
things like that that's all I meant

358
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:21,080
about office locations info the Linux

359
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:27,230
client doesn't support trunking right

360
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:30,710
now at all so you have net F has some

361
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,809
resources that could implement there I'm

362
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,870
not really planning to do any

363
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,660
implementation there Solaris doesn't

364
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,729
have any resources that I know of to to

365
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,880
to try this out I mean they were the the

366
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:47,110
main drivers of the transparent state

367
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:52,010
migration work in both Solaris and Linux

368
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:55,070
okay all right so as far as the trunk

369
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,760
anything it sounds like we net have made

370
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,409
may be working on both in parallel and I

371
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,840
think my smile

372
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,000
would be to try to do as much as the for

373
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,800
Daddo and for one to work together I'm

374
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,770
not sure how that works and the cause

375
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:14,780
exists as far as transparent state

376
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:18,470
migration the only server implementation

377
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:21,470
was on Solaris and that's not gonna go

378
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,200
into for that one the Solaris server

379
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,320
does support for point one it does yeah

380
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,400
even before even though before was it

381
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,230
was an RFC okay

382
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,260
right and they prototype most of the

383
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,930
stuff that you've done up to about 18

384
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,170
months ago in that document so I think

385
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,540
that's pretty well okay the Linux client

386
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,520
does support transports transparent sync

387
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,879
migration in both for oh and for one

388
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,139
okay alright well that's good to know so

389
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,500
that means that if the clients there

390
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,350
then I could think about this is what I

391
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,270
really should mention I don't know the

392
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,850
state of it because I asked them to come

393
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,770
here VMware is implement implemented

394
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,350
finally their four point one support so

395
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,920
I don't know where they I could ask them

396
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:10,280
after this not implemented because they

397
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,930
asked some questions but that for that

398
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,020
one in general are about this reason or

399
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:19,250
specific for the trunking okay because

400
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:23,360
they have the demand called migrations

401
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:25,370
in okay if there is no migrations well

402
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,320
then I should you know I should be in

403
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:34,489
contact okay sure

404
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,679
alright so that I think ends that okay

405
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,520
alright my next story I think that's you

406
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:43,220
you Jenna

407
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:47,210
oh alright I give one with slide oh all

408
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,920
right sorry Trombley okay Trump trunk

409
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,530
and rehabilitation well this is

410
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,800
irrelevant but just told me that

411
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,389
basically it appears that except for

412
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,149
people who are not in this room or on

413
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,310
Meetup even me that go it's probably nap

414
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:05,260
who's gonna do doing the starting work

415
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,260
on both the client and the server and

416
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,780
transparent state migration Chuck tells

417
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,780
me that

418
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,470
for no one support isn't the client

419
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:19,110
there's essentially prototype unofficial

420
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,810
but pretty close to the document support

421
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,639
from fee 4.1 in the server and I don't

422
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:26,330
know what my plans are but I I will

423
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:30,300
think about what what plans I have for

424
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:33,929
state migration in my server okay

425
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,240
all right and I think that is the end of

426
00:24:33,930 --> 00:25:01,680
it finally okay that is now it's you

427
00:24:36,240 --> 00:25:06,560
Chuck servant seemly power next

428
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,560
presentations by Chuck Lieber RPC on TLS

429
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,460
there's a conversation going on in the

430
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,800
room Chuck's work Chuck's waiting for

431
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:28,440
with the undivided attention of the yeah

432
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:30,560
yeah all right so this is work that's

433
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:36,500
happened since the last time we met

434
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:42,750
which was here a year ago I proposed

435
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:44,910
that we enter the 21st century that NFS

436
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,550
enters of 21st century and support

437
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:50,190
encryption by default in other words

438
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:53,790
when you install client it could have

439
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:57,230
some facility for using on the spot

440
00:25:53,790 --> 00:26:00,990
created a certificate material to

441
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,920
encrypt its transmission to a server in

442
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,960
just the same way that web server could

443
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,580
web browser on a web server can do it

444
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,100
and this slide sort of enumerates the

445
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:20,519
things that we're really looking looking

446
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:23,158
for in this in this feature we spent

447
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,570
we want to protect the use of assist

448
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,859
because that's still widely deployed a

449
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,979
lot of people depend on it it's very

450
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,899
simple to deploy you just used UID

451
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:32,959
numbers and make sure that they match up

452
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:36,839
on the client server and you're all done

453
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:42,269
it's a lot simpler than GSS which is why

454
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:43,559
GSS is not more widely deployed I think

455
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:46,109
I was also interested in taking

456
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,908
advantage of the kind of hardware

457
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:51,468
implementations of encryption offload

458
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:53,399
that are available for TLS and

459
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:55,289
unfortunately most operating systems

460
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:57,809
that are widely deployed like Linux and

461
00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:00,299
Windows have support already software

462
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:03,389
support already for TLS and support for

463
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:09,029
an it for such Nix that allow Hardware

464
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:11,039
offload so these are the two main

465
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,649
benefits that we're hoping to get and I

466
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,929
mentioned privacy already I've had

467
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:20,129
actual user requests for this Oracle

468
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,859
many people don't know this but Oracle

469
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:28,738
does have a have a cloud just like azure

470
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:31,408
and Google and Amazon the Oracle cloud

471
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:35,389
infrastructure OCI folks came to me and

472
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:38,129
asked for support for NFS with

473
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:39,779
encryption so that when anybody brings

474
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:42,599
up a tenant with a bunch of Linux

475
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:46,919
clients that they they can get they can

476
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,359
get privacy on the wire it turns out

477
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,549
that Amazon already has this feature

478
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,389
they have a tunneling feature that

479
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:56,549
they've got built-in that got a sub

480
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,468
command a mount sub command that allows

481
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,029
them to create an SSH tunnel on the

482
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:03,570
client that connects to the server and

483
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:05,159
then they they tunnel NFS over it there

484
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:09,079
was an interesting article and I think

485
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:12,149
lwn or was it a linux journal about it

486
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,918
nine months ago where a guy outlined it

487
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:18,329
exactly how I did this thing provide

488
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,739
scripts and it looked like something you

489
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,570
tear your hair out to implement I mean

490
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,249
there's just huge number of little

491
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,570
tweaky things to do and I thought why

492
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:27,029
can't we do this in the protocol and

493
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:30,280
just you know not not require any kind

494
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:33,070
of SSH tunnel at all so

495
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,050
privacy was the first important most

496
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,060
important goal the second one was we

497
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,440
want to be able to provide a degree of

498
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,030
machine authentication in other words

499
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,700
the clients should be able to

500
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,780
authenticate the server make sure

501
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,880
they're connecting to the right machine

502
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,860
and the server's should be able to

503
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,690
defend any chthonic a the clients and

504
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,840
when they do that then they can use the

505
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,370
authentication material as part of an

506
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,260
authorization of the client to make sure

507
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,610
that this is a client that is allowed to

508
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,980
talk to me and they're sure because

509
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:04,540
there's cryptographic authentication

510
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,310
going on there are some secondary

511
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,399
benefits I don't have to go through

512
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:11,169
those most of the stuff is listed in is

513
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,010
already discussed in the introduction of

514
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,930
the RPC on TLS draft the third bullet

515
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,900
usually trips some people up but the

516
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:24,790
idea there is that we want the ability

517
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:27,340
to provide an authentication mechanism

518
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,540
for the machines that is completely

519
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,730
independent of the fennec ation

520
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,980
mechanism that's used for users so for

521
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,230
example a client can use lots sis and it

522
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,020
can use TLS on the wire to authenticate

523
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,450
the who the client is but it doesn't use

524
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,629
TLS to use to authenticate users

525
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,370
unlike GSS when you use GSS you're stuck

526
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:52,660
with GSS and authentication of both

527
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:58,320
users and the clients and machines so we

528
00:29:52,660 --> 00:30:02,370
are already working on prototypes

529
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,689
tigran merck Chen has been working on

530
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:10,020
prototypes of client and server in user

531
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:13,240
space for the German research firm Daisy

532
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:17,500
he brought it to a big phone in May and

533
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,990
demonstrated it links Linux is also

534
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,060
getting a kernel implementation

535
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,700
prototype implementation that Trond is

536
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,149
working on my co-author that is still in

537
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,690
progress

538
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,190
there are I had a couple more listed

539
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:34,990
here on this slide but you know they're

540
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:38,590
there folks who probably don't need a

541
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:42,580
public mention of prototyping efforts in

542
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,810
case they decide to scrap so need let's

543
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:49,720
just say

544
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:51,010
there are some other interests okay that

545
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,360
might even be mentioned in the

546
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:59,650
implementation status section of the

547
00:30:52,360 --> 00:31:01,780
document anything from AWS because I

548
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,140
know they're working you also have

549
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,370
something

550
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:08,530
so we've you're asking about Amazon yeah

551
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:12,340
we've had some in-person communication

552
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:15,070
with the Amazon NFS team they have their

553
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,189
their elastic file system is nfsv4 :

554
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:21,220
based on to mention that if somebody's

555
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:23,830
using them yeah there there are there

556
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,660
are tenets of the Amazon zone that there

557
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,980
are ten tenants of the Amazon Cloud that

558
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,960
are using their encryption technique and

559
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:38,080
they they met with us recently trying to

560
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:40,570
die with them to discuss how stable the

561
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:45,220
document is and what the Linux prototype

562
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,629
would look like and how key material

563
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,070
would be managed and things like that so

564
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,110
they're they're looking very closely at

565
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,840
this and I I have a sense that they're

566
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,699
interested in implement implementing

567
00:31:51,840 --> 00:32:05,070
something that will be interoperable

568
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:05,070
with Linux we've also talked about some

569
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:11,800
future works that the future work that's

570
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:14,680
going to be needed for NFS support for

571
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,540
TOS it's probably a bunch of little

572
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,570
details but probably the most important

573
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:22,000
thing is is tying together the lease

574
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,030
management credential the thing that's

575
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,070
used for authenticating a client ID and

576
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,920
exchange ID with the transport

577
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,020
credentials so that the clients are

578
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,150
fully authenticated there are some other

579
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,610
details which I'm not remembering at the

580
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,170
moment but we'll need a document to

581
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:41,439
write this stuff down I don't think I'll

582
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:45,100
be a long one we've also been thinking

583
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,520
about in the longer term creating a an

584
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,860
RPC on quick transport large tells me

585
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:54,010
that quick is probably not quite mature

586
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,919
enough to begin actual work on this but

587
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:59,379
it's coming close and I think

588
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,420
it would be good for us if we started

589
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,250
looking closely quick to understand what

590
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,730
we need to do to build such a transport

591
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:08,230
and what capabilities that would give us

592
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:11,710
I don't have to go into that right now

593
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:15,190
unless people would like to but you know

594
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:20,140
you all know me so come talk if you have

595
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:22,300
opinions about this now this slide is

596
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:26,170
next steps for the document itself that

597
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:29,590
the RPC on TLS document we're wondering

598
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,120
if she had a charter milestone for this

599
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:35,770
document because there isn't one right

600
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:39,790
now and it as I began this presentation

601
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:42,160
just reiterate that this work disk is

602
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,590
sort of blossomed over the last nine

603
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,930
months to a year since we last talked

604
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:50,110
about the Charter so now is a good time

605
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:54,220
for us to consider that we've had one

606
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:56,050
sector review already that was a more

607
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,460
nascent version of the document maybe we

608
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,080
want another one now that we've added a

609
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,280
lot more detail to it especially around

610
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:06,909
authentication we've had some comments

611
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:09,790
from implementers requesting more detail

612
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,320
regarding the Machine authentication and

613
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,659
what the requirements are there I'm not

614
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,440
sure we need to put those in I know that

615
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,540
my co-author is not interested in

616
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,760
nailing that down firmly right now we

617
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:26,350
want to give implementations some

618
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,570
freedom to experiment in that regard so

619
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:33,489
I'm kind of open to either approach I

620
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:36,550
like to your opinions about that I think

621
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,199
Dave is interested in seeing some more

622
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:42,640
text focusing on the weaknesses of auth

623
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:45,639
Sisson and how in transit encryption

624
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,989
will will help close some of those

625
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:52,060
exposures I think that will feed into

626
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:53,949
this improvements to the security

627
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,400
considerations sections for Ana fests in

628
00:34:53,949 --> 00:35:00,939
in later documents and obviously we need

629
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,320
to refine the threat model and security

630
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,960
analysis presented in the security

631
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,690
consideration section because this is

632
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,100
certainly all about security and we need

633
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,920
to we need to make sure

634
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:19,000
that is tight I think this is last slide

635
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:22,330
yes it is questions discussion the

636
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,980
action regarding for the working group I

637
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,980
here is to add a milestone basically

638
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:36,700
Magnus no no no no that that one action

639
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,670
is adding a milestone for this work to

640
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,089
the Charter because it does its work

641
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,680
going on

642
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,940
that's not even covered on our stuff and

643
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:50,080
I need you to think about that okay

644
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:52,510
I mean besides all the work that has to

645
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:56,620
be done from my perspective the

646
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:59,370
milestone update okay thank you any

647
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,720
other observations comments questions

648
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,370
lars do you think we should take this

649
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,589
through sector review again or should we

650
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:08,880
just put it in from the isg in and see

651
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,880
if they have any opinion about it I

652
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,610
think you should probably get some

653
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,970
different sector to look at it again

654
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:23,410
from TLS guy I don't expect any problems

655
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:25,509
because it got better right but you know

656
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,859
why not make them work a little bit well

657
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,270
I'm wondering if they're gonna find a

658
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,450
detail that they might be able to argue

659
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,730
with now yes I mean the more of you you

660
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,620
get now the more power you have later on

661
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,000
to say hey you like looking at this

662
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,980
before why do you come at this stage

663
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,510
okay do I need an ad to press that

664
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,740
button that you press to get the sector

665
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:49,870
review or is there something I can do I

666
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:51,189
he can the chair can okay this is not an

667
00:36:49,870 --> 00:37:00,450
official request to press that button

668
00:36:51,190 --> 00:37:07,680
right now but but be on the ready okay

669
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:07,680
any more comments or questions okay next

670
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,160
yeah

671
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:29,739
is this one or is it the other one I

672
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:33,640
think it's the RDMA one first it's your

673
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:36,690
it does come into the party oh I don't

674
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,950
feel like crying to thank the party

675
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:42,160
sorry that's all these buttons to make

676
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:48,578
sure that you have control look at that

677
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:50,680
okay thank you so this is kind of the

678
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:52,319
work that you know there's an

679
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,999
opportunity cost to working on on

680
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:58,890
exciting new technology like RPC and TLS

681
00:37:54,999 --> 00:38:03,009
this is the work that got back Bernhard

682
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:06,339
when we discovered that we had some

683
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:08,019
excitement around our PC on TLS last

684
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:12,130
year we were talking about RPC over our

685
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:15,459
DMA version 2 and so I thought I would

686
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:18,150
sort of discuss this document that is

687
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:21,219
still a personal draft

688
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,489
and see if we can move this forward a

689
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:23,489
little bit

690
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:30,430
originally when this was proposed

691
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:33,849
several years ago we had some issues in

692
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:36,459
version RPC over already may version one

693
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:40,839
that we thought were kind of important

694
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:45,098
to address immediately one was the

695
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:49,538
ability to integrate well to support

696
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:51,279
transport properties and because we

697
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:56,499
wanted to support remote invalidation

698
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:58,209
and a larger in line threshold because

699
00:38:56,499 --> 00:39:00,819
the default inline threshold for a

700
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:05,078
version 1 is a kilobyte which is too

701
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:08,619
small for NFS before so our goals were

702
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,680
to try to get those transport properties

703
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:13,869
supported and enabling sensibility so we

704
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,469
could so it was easier for us to build

705
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:19,569
on the transport because version 1 had a

706
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:23,440
lot of restrictions in it that that kind

707
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:25,740
of prevented us from doing that and then

708
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,380
later it we we added

709
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,529
I in my opinion I thought we needed a

710
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,119
little more actual we need some protocol

711
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,430
changes to support remote invalidation

712
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,220
fully especially for implementations

713
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:41,940
like the Solaris client because it uses

714
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,980
a mix of our keys that are able to be

715
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,810
remotely invalidated and some that

716
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,160
aren't in each RPC and on each

717
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:52,259
connection we also found the need to add

718
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,700
some better error reporting to to the

719
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:58,980
transport so these are the before soft

720
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,098
sub bullets on this slide are the ones

721
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,330
that we're most interested in so I

722
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,920
thought I'd list some potential

723
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:07,830
extensions that we could do if we had

724
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,180
extensibility in the transport Dave I

725
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,440
think the first one that was proposed

726
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:18,480
was Dave's idea to use send and receive

727
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:24,330
for some in-place data transfer instead

728
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,770
of our DMA another one was eliminating

729
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,348
the use of reply chunks and the reason

730
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,140
why we'd want to do that is because they

731
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:32,670
are needed you have to pre provision

732
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,770
those on the client and sometimes the

733
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,510
client guesses wrong protocols can't

734
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,950
always tell like protocols like an

735
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:42,660
abbess can't always tell how big they

736
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:44,069
need and Dave has also suggested that we

737
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,629
probably want to add some machine

738
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,130
authentication to the transport protocol

739
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,580
in the same way that we were doing with

740
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,109
TLS I'm TCP that actually has not been

741
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,839
proposed yet but I thought I'd put it on

742
00:40:52,109 --> 00:41:00,240
here just as a example potential

743
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:03,119
extension and then last summer a year

744
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,419
ago I came here and talked about a

745
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:10,920
problem I noticed with credit accounting

746
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,530
in our PC I've already maybe v1 there

747
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,080
are a number of shortcomings there and

748
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:18,800
my specials especially concerned about

749
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:22,500
[Music]

750
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,910
transport control plane messages in

751
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,950
other words the credit accounting

752
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:29,009
mechanism in version 1 is tied to RPC

753
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,480
messages and if we want to use if we

754
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,180
want to send messages over the transport

755
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,430
that are not RPC messages will somehow

756
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,220
account for that in our credit and our

757
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,210
flow control especially if we want to

758
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,750
add such

759
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:46,380
control plane messages in extensions so

760
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,670
that is the last proposed change to the

761
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:52,680
original set of goals around this

762
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:54,150
version to proposal they can just

763
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,899
mention some prototyping that's been

764
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:03,570
done a document that is currently

765
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:06,300
waiting for isg review is our pcr team a

766
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:09,440
the CM private data that handles

767
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:12,330
transport properties for a version one i

768
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,730
built a prototype for that in linux you

769
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:17,190
have a server and client and that has

770
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,530
demonstrated the need for and the

771
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:25,380
benefits of both support for remote and

772
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:27,260
validation and larger in line sizes and

773
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,240
it's also identified one or two

774
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:33,330
shortcomings or weaknesses I guess

775
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,200
for example that stuff has to be set up

776
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:38,670
before the the transport is fully

777
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,790
instantiate 'add and the receive buffers

778
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:43,860
and then send buffers are created even

779
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:46,350
though to make the connection you have

780
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,550
to create some of that infrastructure so

781
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,170
there's a there's a chicken-and-egg

782
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,510
problem there that we didn't foresee but

783
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,220
in the prototyping we've managed to work

784
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,140
with that and demonstrate that it's

785
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,390
still beneficial on the area that we

786
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:01,049
haven't really prototype is the

787
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:04,609
extensibility features in version 2 so

788
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,610
we have to think about that carefully

789
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,029
[Music]

790
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,380
Dave suggested I had this slide I think

791
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,270
there's some information on here that we

792
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,950
might need to make a decision about

793
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,430
whether we want to adopt this as work in

794
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:19,470
rip document now before we've actually

795
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:28,230
before the product the proposals feature

796
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:29,459
complete um so questions in discussion I

797
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,320
mean here's some ball points that I

798
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,370
thought you know we probably ought to

799
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,570
talk about a little bit before we

800
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,569
proceed with adoption

801
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:52,038
ah I don't think the working group

802
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:55,459
document has to have a bow on it to go

803
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:59,359
in to the discussion and that'll start

804
00:43:55,459 --> 00:44:02,689
locking it into completion milestone

805
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:08,839
dates and everything I if there's Lara's

806
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:10,819
Magnus you uh any feedback here the

807
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:13,459
comment was that is that the document is

808
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:14,900
not feature complete however and he was

809
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:17,118
working towards that for the working

810
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,039
group official working group document

811
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,999
submission we're moving into working

812
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,989
group document I don't think that's a

813
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:22,609
requirement for the working group

814
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:23,539
document to bring it to work group tacky

815
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,299
work on the document

816
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:28,489
alright so let's just move forward on

817
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:33,019
that and update the milestone on this

818
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:36,069
thing to get that get that locked and

819
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:39,529
loaded for completion is that okay yes

820
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:43,038
Dave one we asked if there's if we got

821
00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:46,459
to include one of these extensions that

822
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:49,160
I put the slide up about as an example

823
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:50,479
or make it part of a document or should

824
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,709
we just sort of set that aside and say

825
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:55,999
yeah that's future work I don't know

826
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:59,140
yeah maybe we don't have the right

827
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:59,140
people in the room to talk about that

828
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,959
the one I should get closer

829
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:09,019
okay sure well you have a long list but

830
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:11,868
there's actually three oh the one that I

831
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:14,238
proposed is not as definitely if it goes

832
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:16,759
in future work so I wouldn't think that

833
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,859
that one certainly should be in the

834
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:20,179
document as the other ones I don't know

835
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:22,578
how the people might have odds of doing

836
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:26,299
this but I don't I don't feel there's

837
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:28,459
any strongly region the one that I think

838
00:45:26,299 --> 00:45:29,929
is most necessary is you know things set

839
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:37,038
but that also could be future work

840
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:39,969
because we'll figure that out we make

841
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:42,920
progress on as we make progress on the

842
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:45,769
authentication on the RPC TLS side we'll

843
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:52,099
need something matching it for the

844
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:54,870
things where you all are agree with that

845
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:56,460
the Machine authentication stuff

846
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,560
seems a little more critical and and

847
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,860
would make I think this version of more

848
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,799
appealing both through the IHG and to

849
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,940
potential implementers so it might be

850
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,530
something we actually do want to

851
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,070
consider putting into the into the

852
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:13,310
document I know it's a it's a it's a

853
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:18,030
heavy lift I agree with that

854
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:22,590
okay so can I ask you a big favor

855
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:25,500
yes yeah sure can you start what let's

856
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:29,340
one move the document to work in group

857
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:33,710
document but let's work on that but then

858
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:39,390
also can you start a thread on the alias

859
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:41,910
about the document document content and

860
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:46,290
this issue so we can bounce it back and

861
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:47,520
forth okay yes so the next the next

862
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:59,970
revision of this document will be

863
00:46:47,520 --> 00:47:02,970
working group 0-0 yes okay next now I go

864
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:15,720
back to the agenda order I originally

865
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:17,279
had okay most of you are probably

866
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,830
rolling your eyes and saying not this

867
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:25,020
again I'm hoping that we can make enough

868
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,310
forward progress on this that there will

869
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,320
be some agreement on what needs to be

870
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,240
done to make this document move forward

871
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:36,840
or decide that it's just not going to

872
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:39,479
work so the document now contains an

873
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:44,160
introduction section that I have tried

874
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:46,220
to keep a pretty high level and as such

875
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,069
it's probably not touching your hearts

876
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:52,529
so today I want to compliment that

877
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:55,560
architectural description of the purpose

878
00:47:52,530 --> 00:48:00,330
and design of integrity measurement with

879
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:02,220
a use case and then I've also been asked

880
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:04,470
for interoperability analysis and I

881
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,750
think I have enough here that I can

882
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:09,950
share that with you and

883
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,940
provide some operational examples and

884
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,980
hopefully that will be enough that by

885
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,970
the end of the talk we can actually talk

886
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:19,260
about the remaining controversies that

887
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,339
erupted on the mailing lists and maybe

888
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:26,160
we can get through them and make some

889
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:28,920
progress so the purpose of integrity

890
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,080
measurement I mean Tegrity measurement

891
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,820
is kind of this highfalutin term that

892
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,440
maybe doesn't mean anything to people

893
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:39,570
but the whole idea here is that we want

894
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,930
to have some way of protecting file

895
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:47,250
content from when it's created all the

896
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:52,470
way to when a user runs it to the point

897
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:54,390
where you do an exec ve on it my sponsor

898
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,700
Oracle is mostly interested in the

899
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:59,339
content of executable files not like and

900
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,200
maybe configuration files not

901
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:07,500
necessarily the files that a user

902
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:09,359
creates so that sort of narrows the the

903
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:12,030
scope of the of the use case a little

904
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,740
bit the idea here is that we have a

905
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,650
protection envelope that's continuous

906
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:19,319
from the point when someone creates the

907
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,300
executable say MV or a or a database

908
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,250
application to the point where it's

909
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,010
where it's actually used and it's

910
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,410
protected at rest on the disk or

911
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,690
whatever storage medium it's on it's

912
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,279
protected in backups it's protected in

913
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:37,620
transit when it's being installed

914
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:40,080
everything so the extension that I'm

915
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:43,259
proposing the NFS enables this

916
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:48,750
protection envelope to stretch from and

917
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:50,730
then if I server to an NFS client so the

918
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,190
idea is that you'd be able to install

919
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:55,050
one of these protected binaries on an

920
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,420
NFS server and when someone doesn't

921
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:00,630
exactly e on a client that has mounted

922
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,060
that server that protection extends from

923
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:06,200
the servers disks through the network

924
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,200
all the way to the client

925
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:18,399
so now a little mind numbing mathematics

926
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:19,720
I'm just gonna state some terminological

927
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,020
definitions here so that we can talk

928
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,089
about this quickly suppose we have a

929
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:29,080
software vendor I'm gonna call the

930
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:31,780
software vendor v this vendor has a

931
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,569
public key pair or has a key pair a

932
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,190
public key and a private key and the

933
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:39,400
software vendor publishes a public key

934
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:43,000
to its customers via the normal

935
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:46,300
mechanisms of that kind of thing so V as

936
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,930
a stream of versions of an application a

937
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:54,490
it publishes a finalized version of this

938
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:56,500
application say a version 1.0 it

939
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:58,270
generates a checksum in a trusted

940
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:04,840
environment and it signs it with a

941
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:08,140
sprite key so now to distribute this

942
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:10,470
software the vendor publishes both the

943
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:15,730
application file content and the signed

944
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:17,919
checksum so taking out of this out of

945
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:20,230
the picture for a moment we can say okay

946
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,090
what does a what does a local system

947
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,290
need to do after its installed one of

948
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:25,150
these things it's got to have a place

949
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:28,390
for storing these keys the public keys

950
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:31,390
at least for the from various vendors it

951
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,790
has to have a security module and that

952
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:37,150
runs in a privileged mode and that can

953
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:40,270
generate the the check sums and verify

954
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:42,640
the signature of the private assigned

955
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,790
check sums that it gets and it has to

956
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:50,950
have a policy for handling the times

957
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:52,300
when if the appraisal fails that policy

958
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:54,790
might be you're not allowed to access

959
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:58,030
the executable it might be I'm going to

960
00:51:54,790 --> 00:52:01,980
report you in an audit log it might be

961
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,980
do nothing but it's gonna have a policy

962
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:09,700
so just on a local file system the

963
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:12,370
customer might install the application

964
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,990
in a local file and it stores the checks

965
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:17,230
on the sign checksum as an extended

966
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,470
attribute and whatever this application

967
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:21,440
is run then the

968
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:24,890
the local security module computes the

969
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:30,440
checksum of it and it verifies that the

970
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:34,040
the stored sign checksum matches the the

971
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:37,670
checksum that it computed oops I'm sorry

972
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:41,210
I'm backing up there we go and as I said

973
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:43,790
the local policy then determines exactly

974
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:45,530
what happens if the scenes your

975
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:49,880
verification fails or the checksum

976
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:51,140
verification fails so what about what is

977
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,730
this looks like when NFS is in the

978
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:59,779
picture today what happens is this the

979
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:02,950
the server has the the policy engine and

980
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,750
the private the the privilege module and

981
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:08,810
when it reads the file off the disk it

982
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:14,300
does all the checking and when the

983
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:18,710
checking fails it it reports that

984
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,690
there's an access error and the the

985
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,550
client can't get access it so it looks

986
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:29,960
like someone just changed the Akal on

987
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:32,750
the file with the NFS extension NFS

988
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,800
would exposed the extended attribute

989
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,569
that's stored on the server to the

990
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,640
client so the client can make its own

991
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:39,500
decisions about this and in fact keep

992
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,609
its own audit log you can have its own

993
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:46,310
policy about whether to fail access to

994
00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:48,589
the file report the prominent log but

995
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,119
most importantly it protects that the

996
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:54,950
data in transit between the server and

997
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:56,210
the client so here's one of the pieces

998
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:00,439
that people have been asking me for a

999
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:02,359
while about and that is how how to deal

1000
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,130
with interoperability in other words

1001
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:08,270
when client a writes some of this

1002
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:09,890
metadata into a file how does client B

1003
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:13,430
read it how is it guaranteed to be able

1004
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:15,348
to read it well the local modules have

1005
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:17,359
been haven't had have had to deal with

1006
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:19,280
this problem forever

1007
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,049
I have to handle backwards compatibility

1008
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,440
as the operating system is upgraded

1009
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:25,880
obviously they don't have to reinstall

1010
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,099
applications or regenerate the the check

1011
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,489
sums or resign them so

1012
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:34,509
the security module has to understand

1013
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:37,849
how to read old versions of it and

1014
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:39,259
obviously it's for offenders will as I

1015
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:41,509
said before release a sequence of

1016
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:43,729
application versions and they may change

1017
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:44,239
the way they they sign and generate the

1018
00:54:43,729 --> 00:54:49,279
checksums

1019
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:51,769
over time so the the security module has

1020
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:54,769
to be responsible for reading this data

1021
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:56,328
understanding it and/or applying a

1022
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:59,180
policy to it if it can't if it can't

1023
00:54:56,329 --> 00:55:01,609
read it it will just say I can't confirm

1024
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,890
that this this checksum is valid or not

1025
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:05,779
and in that case it can either decide

1026
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:08,180
that it's a checksum failure or just let

1027
00:55:05,779 --> 00:55:14,900
the application access it and say it's

1028
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:18,529
unverified so I think it's time for a

1029
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,440
little discussion do we think the

1030
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:23,989
introduction to the document now is

1031
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,789
adequate or does it need some of the

1032
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:30,589
information I presented today included

1033
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:31,999
in it do you think my discussion of the

1034
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:33,799
interoperability concerns I just

1035
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:36,569
presented is good enough to put in the

1036
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:37,930
document or do we need more than that

1037
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,459
[Music]

1038
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:41,749
one of the questions that I have not

1039
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:43,729
been able to get a good answer on is

1040
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:45,439
what's the level of permission that's

1041
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:50,058
needed for a client to modify the

1042
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,069
extended attributes on the server and do

1043
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:53,900
we need to add a new error code to the

1044
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:58,400
end of his protocol that says there's an

1045
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:01,849
integrity failure on the server I can

1046
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:06,949
stop here for a moment any any opinions

1047
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:07,969
comments certainly we've had some of

1048
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:09,799
this discussion on the mailing list

1049
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:13,430
already and we haven't been able to

1050
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:19,849
reach any kind of opinion about it so

1051
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:23,390
I'm bringing up here now in person so I

1052
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:25,549
just one question because I was thinking

1053
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:30,080
going philosophy chair I have a question

1054
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:34,130
you are your name sorry

1055
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:37,880
sorry so affiliation what's your company

1056
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:43,910
doll I said sorry in there I said he's

1057
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:47,180
not my name down so the only question

1058
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:50,089
abroad I was trying to think about it is

1059
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:52,029
when the file is local and because it's

1060
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:55,700
the attribute and is moved to the NFS

1061
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:57,890
would that impact the Europe because you

1062
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:00,259
only move it you may lose some of the

1063
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:01,940
characteristics so the question is is

1064
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,620
this going to address that because I

1065
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:07,070
think that's a use case that could

1066
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:10,400
happen the sign checksum is moved with

1067
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:12,680
the file content so it's from from the

1068
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,640
whatever file system when it moved its

1069
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:19,129
gets his own yes the it's an extended

1070
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,319
attribute and the tools the standard

1071
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:24,800
file system tools like tar and CP and MB

1072
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:28,190
all have two so not MV reserves in fact

1073
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:33,200
if you may well will they will preserve

1074
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:35,900
that extended attribute Tom Haines

1075
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,689
hammer space just a comment I would give

1076
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:42,320
an error code that's specific so we

1077
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:44,330
don't have to guess okay I've created

1078
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,270
one the latest version of this called

1079
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:49,370
NFS for air integrity do people feel

1080
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:51,500
that's adequate or would like to rename

1081
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:54,980
it I'm fine with it

1082
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:57,440
okay it's a generic error code it could

1083
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:00,110
be used for other purposes for example

1084
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,000
as long as the client says I support

1085
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:04,340
integrity checking then the server is

1086
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,650
allowed to return that code and I could

1087
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,840
return it for other reasons like oh yeah

1088
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,970
I couldn't read that because the parity

1089
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:17,600
is bad on the raid or something like

1090
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:22,279
that maybe David Park don't make sure

1091
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:26,660
that you also cover the legacy client

1092
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:29,150
that's doing with servers doing the what

1093
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:31,549
you scribes current behavior to protect

1094
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,290
the client that doesn't understand what

1095
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:37,390
his signature is or how to check it

1096
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:37,390
yeah that's discussed in the document

1097
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:49,410
you refer to the client to the case of

1098
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:51,330
fire closer ok yes Dave Novick you

1099
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:55,020
referred to the case of the client not

1100
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:57,660
supporting the attribute right now the

1101
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:00,060
server says what actually supports

1102
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,890
there's no way that I know for a

1103
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,570
client's say I do or don't support

1104
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:11,250
that's right that's part of the

1105
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:14,100
extension that I'm proposing so if this

1106
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:17,220
if the client if there's a legacy client

1107
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,720
it doesn't it doesn't ask if the server

1108
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,020
supports this feature and the server's

1109
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,060
not allowed to root to return the new

1110
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:27,500
error code it would return e access

1111
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,500
instead which is what that's the day

1112
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:44,049
so can I assess the general comfort

1113
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:46,900
level of people in this room for moving

1114
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:49,619
forward with this document or do we need

1115
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,619
to take another approach

1116
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,690
nobody is proposing another approach so

1117
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,240
there's only one question on the table

1118
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:02,410
well I can if if people are not

1119
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,410
comfortable with this approach I would

1120
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:08,410
propose something else that's what I

1121
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:10,299
meant sorry nobody nobody in the front

1122
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:13,960
of the room sitting at the chairs table

1123
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:21,759
is asking for that oh great

1124
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:27,490
generally okay okay should we hum yes so

1125
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:31,420
I would rather take this to working

1126
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,308
group discussion then to document which

1127
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,630
which basically kicks the process in of

1128
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:37,960
us deciding whether or not we want to

1129
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:40,210
actually ship this thing okay so instead

1130
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,430
of talking about chipping it we'll talk

1131
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:45,069
about whether we like we've had some

1132
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:47,169
procedural issues on the list when I

1133
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:49,529
publish news versions of the document

1134
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:55,349
there is one person on the list who is

1135
01:00:49,529 --> 01:01:03,759
who is not here who objects every time

1136
01:00:55,349 --> 01:01:06,670
okay but let's discuss that later all

1137
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:08,410
right yeah all right if I wanted

1138
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,509
everybody to agree with me I would no

1139
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:12,640
I'm just asking for what is the process

1140
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:17,170
for helping this document move forward

1141
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:22,420
despite the objection it is working her

1142
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:23,950
apartment today after after confirming a

1143
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,660
decision did the sense of the room here

1144
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,490
on the list that should be working group

1145
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:33,779
doctor then thence measures workgroup

1146
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:38,680
doc I wanna make sure I understand the

1147
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:42,670
maintainability this it sounds like from

1148
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:46,299
an NFS protocol point of view the new

1149
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:49,660
attributes contents are opaque because

1150
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:50,540
the IMA and the software vendor are in

1151
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:54,350
cahoots

1152
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:57,050
if and NFS doesn't understand what's

1153
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:59,569
going on and doesn't need to okay the

1154
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:02,090
very last prepositional phrase you used

1155
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:04,520
is exactly the point it doesn't need to

1156
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:06,170
yes and it's not trying to in particular

1157
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,150
try and particulars

1158
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:10,130
this is not headed down a rat hole of

1159
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,930
the finding of the funding signature

1160
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,820
format so signature algorithms that's

1161
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:16,220
not in a Vestas problem it doesn't care

1162
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,960
that has been my position since day one

1163
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,580
and there are some people in the list

1164
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:31,250
who feel that it really needs to be done

1165
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:33,620
by us by somebody it's not like there is

1166
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:35,420
someone else closer was it's not only

1167
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:38,270
some other authority will write this

1168
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,870
down that's that doesn't want to that's

1169
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:49,640
the problem

1170
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:51,170
yes it's go ahead let's see it's gonna

1171
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,710
have to be left to somebody else because

1172
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:57,680
when the works the way it does in the

1173
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:59,660
local case I think is the crucial to me

1174
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,970
is it reaches a crucial argument that

1175
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:05,629
takes this out of the scope of what NFS

1176
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:07,279
cares about the other thing I'll note is

1177
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:10,540
yeah that proper level permission

1178
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:14,920
question is a biggie keep asking because

1179
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:14,920
there's a denial service attack there

1180
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:35,060
okay there's one more slide but yeah the

1181
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:37,390
pointers not responding anymore two more

1182
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,390
voids

1183
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:47,240
this is not in the Charter should we add

1184
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:49,700
a charge milestone yes we have to add a

1185
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:52,640
milestone for this okay

1186
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,710
yes sorry I know Dave's gonna have a

1187
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,040
discussion later about milestones we

1188
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,040
need to

1189
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:06,500
right right but but we need to clean up

1190
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:12,589
the milestones it's a its Santa

1191
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:19,010
sanitation work ok so yes milestone all

1192
01:04:12,589 --> 01:04:21,619
along here notes what else is there

1193
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:26,000
what's the criterion before that I need

1194
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:27,650
to meet defer we can do a last call do

1195
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,920
we think is that not something we want

1196
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:33,109
to decide here that's fine but again I

1197
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:38,270
asked Brian plus key again I asked you

1198
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:41,770
to take the to restart conversation on

1199
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:44,990
the work of group Elias please okay and

1200
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:49,369
with anything with an update of what we

1201
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:53,990
would you cover today and then let's

1202
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:57,369
let's drive okay all right well most

1203
01:04:53,990 --> 01:05:04,669
like and by the way Spencer's on to he's

1204
01:04:57,369 --> 01:05:11,119
taking lots of notes I'm sure end it one

1205
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:14,329
more slide yeah I'm not sure this is

1206
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,530
really super interesting probably the

1207
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:18,680
rest of the talk wasn't really super

1208
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:22,460
interesting but there's a lot more to

1209
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:25,279
ima than just file content and there's a

1210
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:28,849
whole section of it that I did not try

1211
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:32,060
to propose or implement around

1212
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:34,339
protecting the attributes file

1213
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:39,619
attributes and that would include Ackles

1214
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:44,049
and access control likes mac attributes

1215
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:44,050
file capabilities and a few other things

1216
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:51,859
i've i've asked the question in the

1217
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:53,240
linux integrity community whether that

1218
01:05:51,859 --> 01:05:55,430
feature that part of the IMA is

1219
01:05:53,240 --> 01:06:00,410
necessary before we can demonstrate

1220
01:05:55,430 --> 01:06:03,529
whether NFS with IMA is useful or

1221
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:06,589
effective and they seem to think that we

1222
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:10,190
don't need EVM for that so we can skip

1223
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:11,299
the attribute verification for now and

1224
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,380
there's a lot of problems around that of

1225
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,309
course because every operating

1226
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:16,160
system has a different way of

1227
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:18,470
representing these these attributes and

1228
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,379
there's no standard implementation of

1229
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:23,240
file capabilities either so there are a

1230
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,950
lot of there's a whole rat's nest of

1231
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:29,359
stuff there that that I'm avoiding by

1232
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:32,689
not attempting that the other thing that

1233
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:35,529
I am leaving for future work is dealing

1234
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:37,309
with the performance implications of

1235
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:39,380
changing one of these files and

1236
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:43,930
resigning it or changing a large file

1237
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,930
and having to checksum it repeatedly and

1238
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:50,029
and the draft is agnostic on how this

1239
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:51,680
data is cache because the security

1240
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:53,329
module at the private the privilege

1241
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,690
module is supposed to cash the check

1242
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:58,250
sums they they're supposed to compute

1243
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:00,799
the checksum once when it's read in and

1244
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,960
then cache that so there it's supposed

1245
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:05,210
to handle secure performance reasonably

1246
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,740
well but anyway that I'm punting on that

1247
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:14,799
so that's that's it for this talk okay

1248
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:19,160
and um I I would prefer not expanding

1249
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:22,509
the work now okay yeah that definitely

1250
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:27,288
we're going to wrap it okay

1251
01:07:22,509 --> 01:07:37,039
Bryan plus key are you the next talk -

1252
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:40,130
no all right and that's we got that okay

1253
01:07:37,039 --> 01:08:00,380
then this one thanks and and enjoy the

1254
01:07:40,130 --> 01:08:09,049
veal the meal veal veal okay doesn't

1255
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:24,130
work okay so this is try okay yeah all

1256
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:24,130
right all right - what do that

1257
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,658
now the clicker worked without

1258
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:31,238
fullscreen before it just didn't work

1259
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:34,719
well well anyway it doesn't work yeah

1260
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:37,899
anyway regardless that this is a review

1261
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,489
of the my system a year makes sense to

1262
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:46,149
review the milestones and where we are

1263
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:46,839
aren't all right oh I'm doing it okay go

1264
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:48,790
ahead and do it

1265
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:51,158
all right so if it doesn't work it's all

1266
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:53,080
your fault yeah all right all right this

1267
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:56,229
is the mouth the two-mile sense of the

1268
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,019
action we've actually achieved what does

1269
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:01,269
the migration is just document that was

1270
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,920
the goal was wooden glass it's call and

1271
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,259
we decide after working class last

1272
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:07,779
called there's no point in publishing

1273
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:10,179
that as an RFC so it is done there's no

1274
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:12,219
RFC the other one that was achieved is

1275
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:14,949
before to know trunking discovery with

1276
01:09:12,219 --> 01:09:19,299
Chuck got through the RFC that has done

1277
01:09:14,948 --> 01:09:21,790
through ask G as that is RFC 85-87 and

1278
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:24,908
his posted frozenness so I two other

1279
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:29,620
very eight milestones are done now on

1280
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:36,129
the next slide yeah somebody turned it

1281
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:40,330
off was you right anyway all right so

1282
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:42,339
now the remaining ones we have these are

1283
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:46,089
the four where we haven't achieved them

1284
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:49,859
and the target state is in the past so

1285
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:53,198
that is a total of four milestones so

1286
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:55,739
nvme for PN FS which is still interested

1287
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:58,900
in within the working group but it's

1288
01:09:55,739 --> 01:10:02,049
that I'll talk about later but it's the

1289
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:04,659
target was a long time ago let's say

1290
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:06,670
over a year ago and it's clear that's

1291
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:08,489
not going to done we don't know who we

1292
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:11,679
want to figure out what do about that

1293
01:10:08,489 --> 01:10:13,178
now trunking discovery and transparent

1294
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,830
state migration sort of all and talked

1295
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:17,320
about in previous talk those two

1296
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:19,809
milestones are one document and the

1297
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:22,269
target was March 2019 we had to always

1298
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:24,489
go around to the ISD and I'm hoping that

1299
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:29,320
we'll go go to work and grew last call

1300
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:31,209
and get the hope I hope since I've given

1301
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,330
the III as chief what they're asking for

1302
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:37,300
I hope that we'll be okay with that and

1303
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:40,740
I'm hoping for October 2000

1304
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:44,350
and that has been discussed elsewhere

1305
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:47,110
and see a private date that original

1306
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:50,770
target was was June of this year but

1307
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:54,150
there were some issues with with again

1308
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:57,970
the document think and started with the

1309
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:59,679
with the write-up and I think it's Chuck

1310
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:02,050
said it was now an iced tea I think it

1311
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:05,320
does have to go to an air-to-air agent

1312
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:08,170
review but in any case um I think I

1313
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:11,410
expected to be done by to be reached by

1314
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:14,380
September 2019 so Chuck Lieber you're

1315
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:16,780
right it's waiting for consensus right

1316
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:21,730
up in the ad review I think that's it I

1317
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:25,599
think I think oh all righty all right

1318
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:27,280
Spencer did move it too but he did not

1319
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,420
actually produce the consensus so it's

1320
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,450
waiting for consensus that needs

1321
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:34,120
consensus right right up ad review and

1322
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:37,179
then go to the s G and we're hope that

1323
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:39,940
all gets done by by September okay

1324
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:51,250
that's the end of those slides then we

1325
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:52,750
also have a few slides which all right

1326
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,400
I already made layout for being a mess I

1327
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:59,170
have separate slides for that that is

1328
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:03,179
that we have a target date of September

1329
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:06,520
that's probably not not achievable and

1330
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:08,050
this will discuss that later and the RPC

1331
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:13,020
over are debating Chuck's already talked

1332
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:15,580
about that the target date is December I

1333
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,740
think Chuck has to make a decision

1334
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:19,620
whether that's that's achievable or it

1335
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:23,559
needs to be adjusted I don't know what

1336
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:27,540
probably all right I think that's a good

1337
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,540
guess but we need a new guest from you

1338
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:36,010
whenever I can get it if you have it now

1339
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:39,640
you can give it to me now okay we'll

1340
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:43,300
talk okay now now we have to think about

1341
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:45,700
any miles those we had we had we had

1342
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:48,000
initial set of milestones for two years

1343
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:50,079
and that two years is over but all the

1344
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,059
milestones are not gone

1345
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:55,960
we have to be thinking about replaced

1346
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:58,000
with milestones now replacement of not

1347
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,880
reached a new milestone we need an owner

1348
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,770
who's gonna drive it a target date a

1349
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,349
preliminary document which could be an

1350
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:07,090
individual draft but has to be an

1351
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:09,429
individual draft where we think it's

1352
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:12,219
conceivable that will become a working

1353
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:13,960
group draft and it has to be working and

1354
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:16,570
part of that is important group interest

1355
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,070
and we should this is a two year go to

1356
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:23,549
your window let's have a target date

1357
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:29,170
before hours of 2021 way off then okay

1358
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:31,179
anyway some possibilities well we're

1359
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:33,579
both some men mentioned integrity

1360
01:13:31,179 --> 01:13:37,420
measurement is one thing might get an

1361
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:41,199
RPC TLS some future working group the

1362
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:42,969
mate may may may get milestones like RFC

1363
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:46,239
fifty sixty one this which I'm going to

1364
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:48,730
talk about may be Chuck's men mentioned

1365
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:52,269
the NFS focus security related document

1366
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:53,348
but that is not it's not far enough

1367
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:56,309
along that would that might be a

1368
01:13:53,349 --> 01:13:59,710
milestone but that might in the future

1369
01:13:56,309 --> 01:14:02,679
its nebulous RPC over already made

1370
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:06,219
version to I guess that also actually is

1371
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:09,130
the current milestone I make a lot made

1372
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:11,230
a last past this is said oh gee I'd

1373
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:13,780
missed slides two weeks ago and I'd look

1374
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:18,699
at them and that's wrong so that's

1375
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:22,960
already in last master so possibilities

1376
01:14:18,699 --> 01:14:25,839
I think draft CEO and efficient for SEC

1377
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:29,320
level extensions okay no no there's a

1378
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:34,210
sense Tom's dead end

1379
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:35,710
okay all right Tom's document meant they

1380
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:38,230
might eventually turn into something

1381
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:39,989
that might have a Tata box yes yes it

1382
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:43,769
should okay fine

1383
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:45,070
then we'll talk about that's my daughter

1384
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:48,040
okay

1385
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:50,920
right is it will be we've been talking

1386
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:53,349
about Flint's of files b2b no because

1387
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,199
the the flexibility to will only come

1388
01:14:53,349 --> 01:14:58,510
out when we Kerber eyes it and someone's

1389
01:14:56,199 --> 01:15:00,730
got to be interested in doing this okay

1390
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,090
so that's probably not likely no all

1391
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:03,188
right

1392
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:08,590
all right

1393
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:11,139
now envy me for PMF s now it's a spar a

1394
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:15,969
long time ago the current target is gone

1395
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:22,389
a year ago it's we've been just keeping

1396
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:24,610
on hoping that that somehow this would

1397
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:27,070
be revived but it hasn't been it can't

1398
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:30,058
be revived in its current form basically

1399
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:33,489
we have to declare it dead and

1400
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:36,780
reincarnate if now you mention the

1401
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:40,478
possibility of working on that so

1402
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:43,570
depending on how my presentation goes I

1403
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:45,849
have the intention to take over that and

1404
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:48,249
finished I know there is a cap I have to

1405
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:51,550
figure out the gap but I don't know if I

1406
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:57,030
can count on Christophe but I intend to

1407
01:15:51,550 --> 01:16:06,150
pick it up so if as a condition for my

1408
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:07,650
deduction something without Christopher

1409
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:12,070
[Music]

1410
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:18,219
wait I need that at the mic what are you

1411
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:20,289
saying Chuck Weaver Urkel so in order

1412
01:16:18,219 --> 01:16:23,699
for someone to take over this document

1413
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:26,469
they'll need permission of Christophe

1414
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:32,768
why it's a document for the work that I

1415
01:16:26,469 --> 01:16:36,459
definitely do the next version when I do

1416
01:16:32,769 --> 01:16:40,269
a new document that this copies it when

1417
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:43,199
I when I was working on the first on the

1418
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:46,059
base our teammate drafts Spencer

1419
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:51,728
insisted that I get permission from Tom

1420
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:54,130
palpated to do this work wait hold up

1421
01:16:51,729 --> 01:17:00,429
wait the area directors are leaving the

1422
01:16:54,130 --> 01:17:02,530
room no I figured out that Magnus is

1423
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:04,689
trying is trying to reach some step goal

1424
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:06,690
today because the longest path to the

1425
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:09,880
microphone

1426
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:12,969
- so I mean if this document I've been

1427
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:17,800
submitted right there founder the PCP is

1428
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:19,600
78 copyright etc we have anyone has

1429
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,440
right to do derivative work based on

1430
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:26,440
that text so that's the formality of it

1431
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:29,290
at least so but yeah I mean we it's it's

1432
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:31,059
nice to ask this or at least informed

1433
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:33,190
that we intend to make it go forward

1434
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,380
yeah and that's that's my I think that's

1435
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:38,769
what Spencer probably meant Spencer text

1436
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:40,480
me if you disagree hey um no so let me

1437
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:42,520
reach out to Kristoff if you don't mind

1438
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,110
and find out what what he what he's

1439
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,640
doing here I'm wondering if he just

1440
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:47,380
basically that the people that he was

1441
01:17:45,640 --> 01:18:01,090
working with is are no longer interested

1442
01:17:47,380 --> 01:18:03,310
in those parts that means that we can

1443
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:06,460
ask his permission maybe you can know

1444
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:08,080
reach to him touch my stuff yeah we

1445
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,910
wanna help him that's what we wanna do

1446
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,280
on the other hand look I don't to take

1447
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:15,370
over his work I just want to the

1448
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:19,360
question is certified by the with that

1449
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:27,400
the question is was how do we go around

1450
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:41,200
is expired or a year ago so did not

1451
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:46,599
continue fortunately they don't keep

1452
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:49,870
statistics about that so unique is my

1453
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:52,330
proposal is to sorry again my proposal

1454
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:55,059
is to revive it and I don't know do I

1455
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:58,210
need the agreement here or I just do it

1456
01:18:55,060 --> 01:19:00,130
and then because it's a it will become a

1457
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:03,000
working group document I don't to take

1458
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:05,740
it only as private I think those private

1459
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,020
let me talk to Chris Alvin action here

1460
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:10,300
I'm talk to Christophe and let me take

1461
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:14,800
it to the alias with the plan for the

1462
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:17,350
stock okay lots of you you shouldn't

1463
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,040
submit a stracciatella week out of my

1464
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:20,630
city you could write this

1465
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,150
system but you can take the content and

1466
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:24,410
if you want to you can you know

1467
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:25,490
acknowledge a media clansmen section and

1468
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:31,370
say that the original version was

1469
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:32,809
written by him so if you get his

1470
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,370
permission if he doesn't have the time I

1471
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,410
wouldn't keep him as a co-author because

1472
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:44,360
it's going to bite you at all 48 at the

1473
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:48,139
latest all right so as possibility of

1474
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:49,790
going forward that all right so then we

1475
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:52,720
had another similar situation although

1476
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:56,240
it's farther long it hasn't expired yet

1477
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:58,820
the the target is still in the future

1478
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:01,639
but it's clearly unrealizable there's no

1479
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:03,650
active document that's expired there's

1480
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:07,370
been some prototyping work based on the

1481
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:10,129
original expired document the problem I

1482
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:12,500
think we discussed this a couple of

1483
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:17,960
months ago the problem is it's hard to

1484
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:24,140
do basically for the metadata server has

1485
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:26,720
to assign has to do things relate to

1486
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:28,190
another connection I'm not sure how you

1487
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,900
know I don't know enough about how our

1488
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,059
teammate works to see if that's valid so

1489
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:34,429
we need someone take this over if

1490
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:38,090
Christophe is not prepared to who is

1491
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:42,230
real our DMA expert truck Libre Oracle I

1492
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:44,620
think where we left this technically is

1493
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:46,580
that there's an architectural problem

1494
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:48,440
that needs to be resolved at the

1495
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:50,690
transport level and perhaps machine

1496
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:53,299
authentication in in the RPC or our team

1497
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:56,769
a transport may resolve it but the issue

1498
01:20:53,300 --> 01:21:00,530
is that when the client reaches out to

1499
01:20:56,770 --> 01:21:02,090
an RDM a data server there's no

1500
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:05,330
authentication that that client has

1501
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:09,410
permission to get to those to get to the

1502
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:12,800
to the layouts and and it's it's

1503
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:14,840
accessing those layouts via raw RDMA and

1504
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,670
there's no authentication in that so

1505
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,820
that's the problem that we need to solve

1506
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:22,880
we need we need active our DMA savvy

1507
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:23,900
engineers working on this I'm not trying

1508
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,410
to be negative I'm just saying that's

1509
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,410
what it's gonna take

1510
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:35,440
so it seems that there sorry Nadal it

1511
01:21:32,869 --> 01:21:39,980
seems that both are related in my

1512
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:43,699
planning my planning was to use both PMF

1513
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:45,440
s RDMA because I wanted to work on any

1514
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:47,809
vmu over fabric yes

1515
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,360
which kinda I don't know what was the

1516
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:53,510
intention of Christophe but it makes

1517
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:57,769
sense now that well I want to point out

1518
01:21:53,510 --> 01:22:01,159
that the thing that that's that's that's

1519
01:21:57,770 --> 01:22:03,639
different with others is a pure Rd made

1520
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:06,199
layout rather than a PMF SR camellia

1521
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:09,320
yeah because I think your work would

1522
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:13,900
curve would Kerr the envy me over fabric

1523
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:13,900
case would not have the Oh

1524
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:19,850
I was just wondering though if he didn't

1525
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:23,900
think about this being related that so I

1526
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:25,369
was I didn't really considered two

1527
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:28,969
separate things and this was a surf

1528
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:30,920
father motivated losing I think but it

1529
01:22:28,969 --> 01:22:33,400
never was followed up on and shuts

1530
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:35,719
identified this problem and I don't know

1531
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:38,809
how we're gonna go forward with that

1532
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:40,280
right now it is where it is it's late

1533
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:43,070
you have to figure out what what to do

1534
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:46,909
about it again he's interested in

1535
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:54,469
working on this area but we may not have

1536
01:22:46,909 --> 01:22:56,150
time okay so now we have to do is it is

1537
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:59,570
this so far along that we should removed

1538
01:22:56,150 --> 01:23:04,489
from milestone list because it is not

1539
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:06,230
expect it's not December yet but looking

1540
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:08,360
at it it's unrealistic to believe that

1541
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:11,178
will be completed by December you

1542
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:15,589
thought working document sorry this is

1543
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:17,030
not working group canceled but it's

1544
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:21,500
something I think the working group is

1545
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:24,500
interested in but I know what we can do

1546
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,510
but given the the problem that shirts

1547
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:30,500
mentioned we don't really have anyone

1548
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:33,350
who can take this over so there's no

1549
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,820
there's no downside this just to make

1550
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:36,969
not making a decision for another few

1551
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:41,000
months but cleaver Oracle drop it I

1552
01:23:36,969 --> 01:23:41,860
think we strongly okay I'm okay with

1553
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,719
that

1554
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,159
I mean there's there's no I think you've

1555
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:47,199
told me this before there's no way of

1556
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:49,299
recording working group interests other

1557
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:52,440
than here's an active document and we

1558
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:53,880
don't have an active document all right

1559
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:57,339
fine

1560
01:23:53,880 --> 01:24:02,679
good point if not so good to hear but

1561
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:05,139
you're right okay all right all right

1562
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:10,869
in any case my point your point you're

1563
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:13,020
right here we are I think that's it oh

1564
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:18,099
well there are some other possibilities

1565
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:20,469
could we look at could look at the

1566
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,969
general architecture Chuck doesn't have

1567
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:24,520
any time to write it up but may some

1568
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:28,510
maybe we discuss this maybe there is a

1569
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:30,340
way around this architecture problem but

1570
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:32,250
it is something it seems like something

1571
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:36,369
we'll wanted to address in the future

1572
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:37,929
given that we have you know given if

1573
01:24:36,369 --> 01:24:39,790
there's more interest in our to made the

1574
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:40,540
idea of to an argument lie it was always

1575
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:43,269
a good one

1576
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:47,080
it's just we have this big solid

1577
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:51,460
authentic problem and your point maybe

1578
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:54,699
once we get more complicated more more

1579
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:56,380
more comfortable with the idea of

1580
01:24:54,699 --> 01:25:00,400
machine authentication maybe there's

1581
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:02,920
some in there but I guess how you get to

1582
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,969
from there to Road to game or are you me

1583
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,580
I don't know how we're gonna make that

1584
01:25:03,969 --> 01:25:09,130
transition all right I think that's it

1585
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:21,480
for me I think actually on the next one

1586
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:21,480
I'm not sure you are this document right

1587
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:31,179
all right yes so we finally got a BIST

1588
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:34,659
document for before that oh and I think

1589
01:25:31,179 --> 01:25:36,159
now for reasons I'm Greta we reaching

1590
01:25:34,659 --> 01:25:40,259
the question of why I want one for

1591
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:43,570
before that one despite the fact that

1592
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:45,179
Tom thinks I'm crazy even though he's

1593
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:49,500
not licensed to practice medicine

1594
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:51,610
anywhere all right as a doctor though

1595
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:53,260
you got

1596
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:58,320
but he's never served a psych your

1597
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:59,530
psychiatric residency anywhere anyway

1598
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,290
right

1599
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:04,809
it's a gerald idea as I found dealing

1600
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:08,710
with the ICG one document describing a

1601
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:10,960
minor version the real problem for

1602
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:13,270
readers there are multiple documents on

1603
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,820
the same subject which might or might

1604
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:18,100
not contradict one another the eyes

1605
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:21,639
genes made it clear to me they see the

1606
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:24,340
in various ways not only to me but there

1607
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:27,520
are some issues with lots of not only

1608
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:30,100
this group but other groups updating

1609
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,510
documents and G where the hell are we

1610
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:36,070
which is the document that describes

1611
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:38,170
this so RFC 5061 is building up a set of

1612
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:41,799
updates of which I've contributed to

1613
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:43,330
other people have and but there's other

1614
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,240
ones there needed that have been

1615
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:48,100
deferred for for a while so I think that

1616
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,679
I think the work group needs to address

1617
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:53,290
the situation group for that one I have

1618
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:56,260
a proposal how I might go about doing so

1619
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:57,760
and the work group has to decide one

1620
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:00,760
first day and had an end whether it do

1621
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:04,060
this so I'll be talking about all right

1622
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:08,080
so the we have some update updates there

1623
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:14,110
are in the process proving 4.11 is the

1624
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:17,110
Tom amazing updated RFC v 61 with RFC 84

1625
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:20,500
34 with some changes that he said needed

1626
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:23,110
made to section 12 and I have I

1627
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:27,130
previously talked about the large set of

1628
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:30,580
updates in draft I ATF NFS before RFC

1629
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:33,610
physicist says sweet so those two are

1630
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:35,470
may just enough to make a Mista but then

1631
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:38,769
we have some other things in 5061

1632
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:41,350
internationalization is wrong yes we

1633
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:44,080
have it was when they wrote through this

1634
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:47,740
is the one they took the in nationalism

1635
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:51,610
was RC 35 30 which was wrong nobody ever

1636
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:52,719
implemented that and so we needed a new

1637
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:55,269
internationalisation

1638
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:57,280
and needs a new security consideration

1639
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:59,800
section of the work the chuck has talked

1640
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:02,650
about gives us a possibility of having

1641
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:04,540
reasonable security that people will

1642
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,438
actually be able to implement and I

1643
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:09,340
think we needed

1644
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:12,760
put that to reference that work in an

1645
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:17,409
RFC 5061 Biss and having new security

1646
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:22,059
considerations section right now let's

1647
01:28:17,409 --> 01:28:24,638
talk about the existing security

1648
01:28:22,059 --> 01:28:28,179
considerations section well there's no

1649
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,650
threat analysis and some people in the

1650
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:31,689
eyes do you have and the security

1651
01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:33,759
director have commented on what a mess

1652
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:37,719
that is it should have been a required

1653
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:39,039
but it wasn't we got by luckily well

1654
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:41,619
it's luckily because if we've been

1655
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:44,739
assisted on it at that time there would

1656
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:48,188
be no NFS before if they said yeah you

1657
01:28:44,739 --> 01:28:52,659
must do a secure I think I don't think

1658
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:55,419
we were up to it and beyond them guess

1659
01:28:52,659 --> 01:28:57,400
we didn't have that made it was made as

1660
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:59,559
to easiest for hand wave away serious

1661
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:03,070
serious issue since general general

1662
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:04,809
field we had oh yeah well most time it's

1663
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:07,900
used in fact it's true it's used on

1664
01:29:04,809 --> 01:29:11,189
local networks and people who some

1665
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:13,509
assuming that that fact mean meant that

1666
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:17,169
you didn't have to really worry about

1667
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:19,019
Sookie but you do and as well we have

1668
01:29:17,169 --> 01:29:23,229
poor security rayne edifice before

1669
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:26,800
Austin use was optional and some hand

1670
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:28,840
waving about about that but really it's

1671
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,719
used it's not only optional it's used in

1672
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:35,800
the clear without clarification there's

1673
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:38,949
no security it's really totally

1674
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:41,260
unsecured also even if you've not using

1675
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:46,869
Austin you have privacy integrity one

1676
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:48,999
way is basic model is that you do some

1677
01:29:46,869 --> 01:29:51,880
initial things presumably without all

1678
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:54,219
that without integrity privacy and then

1679
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:57,669
you find out as you cross into various

1680
01:29:54,219 --> 01:30:02,079
various facets you find out whether that

1681
01:29:57,669 --> 01:30:04,239
fastest in group was but that means it's

1682
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:05,530
that means that certain things are done

1683
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:11,110
in the clear and you can't get rid of

1684
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:12,728
them in the protocol and also with Chuck

1685
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:15,459
reference this is difficult and

1686
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:17,949
offloading that that security work

1687
01:30:15,459 --> 01:30:18,710
because different keys keys I used a

1688
01:30:17,949 --> 01:30:23,089
different route

1689
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:25,130
and I think in the architecture checks

1690
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:27,409
working on you have the same you the

1691
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:29,980
same key on each session it's easier to

1692
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:32,269
offload and the other important thing

1693
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:34,940
because the for those problems the

1694
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:38,750
actual use of integrity of prophecy is

1695
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:42,980
very very small very few people not many

1696
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:46,460
people to use associate uses RPC sexy SS

1697
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:48,530
and the amount of use of integrity of

1698
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:51,620
prophecy is bouncing and small so in

1699
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:54,679
terms of whatever the spec says fact the

1700
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:58,040
matter is lots of people use AUSA's and

1701
01:30:54,679 --> 01:31:01,429
that security sucks and the ones that

1702
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:03,440
use RBC to set GSS do not you do

1703
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:05,300
interrogator privacy routinely and if

1704
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:12,678
they did their performance would be

1705
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:17,480
impossible so we have a problem so I

1706
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:20,239
think we need to when as when Chuck view

1707
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:22,040
gives me a target date

1708
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:25,099
I'll have it I'll be able to think about

1709
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:28,179
a target date beyond that because I

1710
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:31,520
think they'll say later that you have to

1711
01:31:28,179 --> 01:31:36,409
reference that work to make it a major

1712
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:37,969
advance in NFS security so the important

1713
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:40,879
things are things that you are had

1714
01:31:37,969 --> 01:31:43,520
mentioned the Crimson support I added

1715
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,320
all the messages it's not a I think in

1716
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,090
your document talk about pieces of the

1717
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:49,130
header is not being predicted but it's

1718
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:51,500
also there are messages that not

1719
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:56,050
protected at all and they're they're

1720
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:58,760
significant and the other thing is even

1721
01:31:56,050 --> 01:32:01,040
though people might wish that some

1722
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:05,030
people might wish it off this is not

1723
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:07,850
going away and we have to make we have

1724
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:10,040
to do something as Chuck did to make

1725
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:11,780
that use of our system and that gives us

1726
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:14,510
the opportunity right an honest security

1727
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:16,040
consider it which does not say gee this

1728
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:18,290
is too insecure to use on the Internet

1729
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:23,449
and lots of other places I don't want to

1730
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:25,190
say that I don't want to one be around

1731
01:32:23,449 --> 01:32:27,199
the bush we want to write a reasonable

1732
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:29,299
security consider session which says

1733
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:30,888
this is secure and that means we have to

1734
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,329
make the check the changes that

1735
01:32:30,889 --> 01:32:33,320
checklist are talked about

1736
01:32:32,329 --> 01:32:36,440
it's good that he's gone through

1737
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:40,579
security directed through the security

1738
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:43,009
director review and I think the mess to

1739
01:32:40,579 --> 01:32:46,759
say well now is this good but is this

1740
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:48,739
good press basis for an official for

1741
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:53,630
security going forward

1742
01:32:48,739 --> 01:32:55,820
sister we can be more relaxed about

1743
01:32:53,630 --> 01:33:00,920
about this that yes we do not have a

1744
01:32:55,820 --> 01:33:02,058
security nightmare in the offing now how

1745
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:09,730
would I get this document

1746
01:33:02,059 --> 01:33:12,290
first of all assuming that RFC

1747
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:15,558
physicists who assess cui I'm hoping get

1748
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:18,019
through the that we have will have a

1749
01:33:15,559 --> 01:33:20,230
this document that have a large set of

1750
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:22,489
changes in it but then we have some

1751
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:25,009
updates that one is the new ended

1752
01:33:22,489 --> 01:33:28,459
nationalization section and then one is

1753
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:31,010
revising I've looked at what's necessary

1754
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:34,730
to revise the back document so that does

1755
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:36,530
not assume that's make than every when a

1756
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:38,329
50 system one was written it was assumed

1757
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:41,090
that every version would make its own

1758
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:42,710
set of versioning rules and that's no

1759
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:45,380
longer the case that that one has to be

1760
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:48,440
update at that point I would have enough

1761
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:51,590
to produce an in an in an individual

1762
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:54,259
draft at that point and at that point

1763
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:56,270
who the were true consider whether to

1764
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:58,610
adapt that as a workgroup document and

1765
01:33:56,270 --> 01:34:01,989
if there were did was available to do

1766
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:06,679
that then we need a few things one is

1767
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:09,530
revised section 12 because he did 84 34

1768
01:34:06,679 --> 01:34:14,090
and he would produce basically a section

1769
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:16,250
12 that would incorporate the work is

1770
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:18,800
done in 84 34 and then the Security Rule

1771
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:22,489
end up debts and that I'm gonna I'll do

1772
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:25,099
a lot of the work in 56 but I need to

1773
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:27,699
normative reference Chuck's document and

1774
01:34:25,099 --> 01:34:30,230
they have to be they don't have to be

1775
01:34:27,699 --> 01:34:32,089
they have to be at least there's

1776
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:34,280
probably the time to do this is probably

1777
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:36,590
at least have been working group does

1778
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:38,780
not have to be published as an RFC but

1779
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:41,059
we have to be they have to have assumed

1780
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:42,500
their final four and then in the working

1781
01:34:41,059 --> 01:34:46,139
group will have to look at about errata

1782
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:49,139
issues but at that point I think we have

1783
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:53,189
so I think oh no that's at least you're

1784
01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:54,749
out but that depends on but I think

1785
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:56,909
that's something that's doable

1786
01:34:54,749 --> 01:35:02,188
we're group s to decide whether it do

1787
01:34:56,909 --> 01:35:06,780
this all right now let's think about the

1788
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:08,909
fourth of the documents one is number of

1789
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:13,079
cases we just contradict the base say

1790
01:35:08,909 --> 01:35:14,339
hey this document updates RFC fifty

1791
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:16,679
sixty one because it says something

1792
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:19,079
different and let the reader figured it

1793
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:23,039
out that's not good but we've done that

1794
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:25,919
wait for 34 it not did not get any

1795
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:29,489
pushback we're done with 8178 did not

1796
01:35:25,919 --> 01:35:31,619
get any pushback but no one was paying

1797
01:35:29,489 --> 01:35:34,949
attention to that but basically we're

1798
01:35:31,619 --> 01:35:36,959
saying that hey we just said this is

1799
01:35:34,949 --> 01:35:41,938
wrong and the implication was everyone

1800
01:35:36,959 --> 01:35:43,860
was clear that this was contrary RFC

1801
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:46,949
fifty to sixty one and before the to

1802
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:49,648
document and peeler Center that had to

1803
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:52,860
be done the other thing was that we

1804
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:55,409
tried to do is explicitly tell users

1805
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:57,688
what has changed that we did in 85 87

1806
01:35:55,409 --> 01:36:00,780
Chuck cut got by with that and at the

1807
01:35:57,689 --> 01:36:04,769
conclusion that we reached is that crude

1808
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:08,518
done for small updates and and we've

1809
01:36:04,769 --> 01:36:10,550
also done a BIST document lee 75 31 so

1810
01:36:08,519 --> 01:36:13,499
we have to consider the eyes team

1811
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:16,229
tolerance for style to updates has

1812
01:36:13,499 --> 01:36:20,610
become more limited and it has as we

1813
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:23,130
said limited to smaller updates and we

1814
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:26,188
hope that the review of style 3 updates

1815
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:30,449
will be will be easier the work that

1816
01:36:26,189 --> 01:36:32,820
camera who's whose camera the name of

1817
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:35,459
the person who is just doing that hour

1818
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:41,188
is doing that document uh how do you

1819
01:36:35,459 --> 01:36:42,780
mean I don't know how there's a lot of

1820
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:45,119
discussions that doesn't see me going

1821
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:48,438
anywhere but I think generally the is G

1822
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:53,188
is looking in that direction

1823
01:36:48,439 --> 01:36:55,590
yes - wisdom yeah I I mean to clarify

1824
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:57,809
something and and it's is that I mean

1825
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:59,910
what I think is you sees is that when

1826
01:36:57,809 --> 01:37:03,690
you do these updates or

1827
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:06,510
lift the protocol to division something

1828
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:08,969
that you should create sets of documents

1829
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:10,950
that's this is all the same maturity

1830
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:12,990
level together they fit together and

1831
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:14,490
that defines the protocol that doesn't

1832
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:15,630
need to be one document and I think

1833
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:18,990
there's actually stuff you need to think

1834
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:23,130
about this actually can you split this

1835
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:26,969
six seven hundred monster you have into

1836
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:30,080
a set of modules which is the whole set

1837
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:32,880
of documents is the 4.1 specification

1838
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,519
because that will make it easy for

1839
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:39,180
everyone to review etcetera and actually

1840
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:42,000
if you continue working future it might

1841
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:44,070
be just okay this is because you may be

1842
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,970
only touching one module you can update

1843
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:49,590
one particular part of it so Magnus this

1844
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:52,350
is something we had thought about trying

1845
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:55,710
to do in the past that was my

1846
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:58,650
recommendation after doing the the the

1847
01:37:55,710 --> 01:38:01,290
for Dobis you you do not want to do a

1848
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:03,960
six under page document this because for

1849
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:06,000
one thing the previous changes were made

1850
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,190
by Gareth G after you've done with your

1851
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,350
edits so you have to go track those down

1852
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:13,410
and that took me like six months to go

1853
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:13,980
find a be ethical place had been changed

1854
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:17,070
yeah

1855
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:25,049
so please yeah I would do the modules

1856
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:28,170
yeah they're dark I think you need to do

1857
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:31,170
some version of three trying to do

1858
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:34,350
incremental updates works when you're

1859
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:37,580
dealing with contained feature function

1860
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:39,510
I see a plan here to completely replace

1861
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:41,970
internationalization and completely

1862
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:43,650
replace a security consideration section

1863
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:46,650
along with a pile of security

1864
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:48,150
functionality and incrementally is not

1865
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:50,219
gonna work well for those I think I

1866
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:52,830
think you need need to plan on all sales

1867
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:55,200
placement modular if possible

1868
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:58,170
so David timings again one of the things

1869
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:00,420
we found with that was when we updated

1870
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:03,360
the security module or the

1871
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:05,280
internationalization for the 4.1 I mean

1872
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:08,690
for the 4.0 and we'd already come out

1873
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:11,160
with a 4.1 we had to go update them both

1874
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:12,719
right and so they they they even though

1875
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:15,090
they were major versions

1876
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,460
it turned out we always wanted the

1877
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:18,960
security considerations to be in sync

1878
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,820
and we always wanted the

1879
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,130
internationalization to be in sync

1880
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:24,330
yeah I think I think I'm basically with

1881
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:26,699
you that those that those are

1882
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:27,840
sufficiently fundamental and pervasive

1883
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:34,049
in their effects and the rest of the

1884
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:35,969
protocol that you you want to just do a

1885
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:38,070
completely consistent set of new Docs

1886
01:39:35,969 --> 01:39:44,190
because those two have to be changed

1887
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:46,580
yes okay right so the problem is when

1888
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:50,339
you point out we have a number we have

1889
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:51,960
before now is one product before the one

1890
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:53,520
is a different protocol but there are

1891
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,710
two pieces like internationalization

1892
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,170
security considerations which you set

1893
01:39:55,710 --> 01:40:01,050
and we would have to really revise the

1894
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:03,449
whole philosophy say that be some before

1895
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:10,350
no that are not version specific but

1896
01:40:03,449 --> 01:40:12,839
that's very difficult to do wait a

1897
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:15,420
minute say that say that again slowly I

1898
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:19,800
think I lost you about both about three

1899
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:23,820
words before the end well okay well we

1900
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:26,730
have a number of pieces of ana 54 that

1901
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:32,580
we want to be the same between v4 dot o

1902
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:35,099
and B 4.1 and if we followed the

1903
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:38,540
philosophy of documented things once

1904
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:41,940
they would have to completely revised

1905
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:45,570
the suggestion here is that 75 30 is the

1906
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:48,480
current for one this it this I I thought

1907
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:51,480
was a discussion about revving for dot o

1908
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:54,360
because in part the I eighteen and

1909
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:59,009
insecurity in Rev in in for dot or a

1910
01:40:54,360 --> 01:41:02,489
problem no one for that o was fixed by

1911
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:04,800
RFC 7532 I'm sorry I've got my versions

1912
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:06,599
backwards seven five thirty fixes fixed

1913
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,880
for oh now you want to apply the same

1914
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:13,530
that the same the same fix it same fixes

1915
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:17,430
to for the 4.1 no you're still saying it

1916
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:22,170
wrong so so we did so 75 30 is the best

1917
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:25,110
for for dot o and it it actually fixes

1918
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:26,250
the internationalization and the

1919
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:29,849
security

1920
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:33,600
and those we said those are also applied

1921
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:38,490
to the 4.1 we just never put it into a

1922
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:41,550
document so so we needed and the we need

1923
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:45,570
the RFC the the 44.1 bits whatever the

1924
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:49,080
monster looks like to say that the

1925
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:53,309
security and the internationalization

1926
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:55,620
out of 75 30 is what's current that's

1927
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:59,760
actually fairly short text which would

1928
01:41:55,620 --> 01:42:03,300
be good well yeah but would wouldn't

1929
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:06,000
better do that they say hey just take

1930
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:09,060
through that one and just put it in

1931
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,400
there rather than across a restless

1932
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:13,590
David I would say we we have two new

1933
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:16,740
documents one says internationalization

1934
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:19,590
in nfsv4 and one says security

1935
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:26,880
considerations in NFS P P dot for and it

1936
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:28,170
applies to 4.0 4.1 and 4.2 and I'm

1937
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,960
actually willing to go do that work

1938
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:36,120
because it makes my life easier

1939
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:39,960
okay well let's think about it that's an

1940
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:40,650
alternative all right I am going to

1941
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:45,480
second

1942
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:48,179
Tom's thing I I'd rather have if it

1943
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:49,830
applies to all versions of NFS I'd

1944
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:52,790
rather never have the conversation of

1945
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:56,400
propagating and cut and pasting

1946
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:58,080
documents to four point two and and just

1947
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,900
I'd rather I'd rather have it separate

1948
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:09,090
and canonical by itself and applying to

1949
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:11,040
all fine for that too so where we do

1950
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:13,530
have things we've designed for low and

1951
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:17,510
quarter one is separate protocols so

1952
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:20,820
this would be just a one-time thing then

1953
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:23,520
we get through that okay so so we have a

1954
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:27,170
proposal I've been to write it down I do

1955
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:31,380
want to talk to Tom about this and also

1956
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:33,930
talk to Magnus about this also sure on

1957
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:36,840
our pro before we before we start doing

1958
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:38,760
anything to clean this up I want to make

1959
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,929
sure we do something that will pass

1960
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:42,510
muster

1961
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:45,989
through the ietf okay but I also want to

1962
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:48,840
also very much want to minimize work at

1963
01:43:45,989 --> 01:43:50,580
this point on this on this stuff I I

1964
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:52,590
don't want to create the problem that

1965
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:54,239
Tom identified of updating a gigantic

1966
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:58,610
document and then have everybody try to

1967
01:43:54,239 --> 01:44:00,629
figure out what just changed okay okay

1968
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:05,719
we'll take this off we'll take this

1969
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:05,719
after the meeting on mail yeah sure Oh

1970
01:44:06,679 --> 01:44:14,429
chuckling Oracle this is slightly

1971
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:16,080
different topic but one item I didn't

1972
01:44:14,429 --> 01:44:19,530
see on the previous slides about what

1973
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:22,440
needs to go in Stockman is I think we

1974
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:24,599
need to consider what has not been

1975
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:27,839
implemented in the end of us before

1976
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:31,440
point one implementations today and look

1977
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:34,429
at ways that that can be those items can

1978
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:36,830
be excised from the new specification

1979
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:39,870
you're thinking about things like

1980
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:40,890
director delegations and our team a step

1981
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:44,400
up and things like that

1982
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:54,929
ssv ssv I believe has been implemented

1983
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:58,440
I thought Lennox does no okay okay well

1984
01:44:54,929 --> 01:45:00,090
I so we I think that needs to be in a

1985
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:02,129
bullet point included in this

1986
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:02,489
conversation that's that was my only

1987
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:08,429
comment

1988
01:45:02,489 --> 01:45:10,530
okay sure - Kristen yeah I I think it's

1989
01:45:08,429 --> 01:45:14,600
good that you do spend the time to

1990
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:18,599
consider what you can remove so to say

1991
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:20,340
which isn't used or or not necessary

1992
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:23,820
cetera to streamline the protocol a bit

1993
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:28,170
that's not bad exercise and yeah as long

1994
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:35,130
as you not overdo it but so I can eyes

1995
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:39,510
Brian plus key here I we removing unused

1996
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:42,739
features from a document is what we

1997
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:46,679
spend on the document but is a it is a

1998
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:49,678
how do I say this it's a it's a it's a

1999
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:53,519
simple edit I if if we like what I think

2000
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:55,050
I'm I don't want to open up a removal

2001
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:58,440
use features to the document and then

2002
01:45:55,050 --> 01:46:02,730
adding new text creating a gigantic

2003
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:04,980
editing review cycle okay okay yeah

2004
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:06,480
that's I mean yeah and I like nothing

2005
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:10,949
like I'd rather I'd rather not touch a

2006
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:12,989
document okay but still I mean yeah but

2007
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:16,169
I mean if you if you haven't use non

2008
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:17,669
implemented features and which you know

2009
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:20,130
it's not going crazy I mean kind of

2010
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:22,409
interoperability you anything issues by

2011
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:25,110
removing I think that's gonna clear-cut

2012
01:46:22,409 --> 01:46:29,909
you just remove those features right but

2013
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:31,889
that's that's but that's yes I just want

2014
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:34,650
to make sure that we don't take a

2015
01:46:31,889 --> 01:46:39,139
clean-up exercise and convert it into a

2016
01:46:34,650 --> 01:46:39,138
let's rewrite the rest of the document

2017
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:49,679
this it's just that I don't think we can

2018
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:52,920
go forward monster but that's finding

2019
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:55,980
the right places and expect to say okay

2020
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:58,110
these two these section or sections are

2021
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:59,730
describing this we take that as well I

2022
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:16,848
think if we delete it every other page

2023
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:19,739
no one but where is references change

2024
01:47:16,849 --> 01:47:21,300
that's where it's I don't know I guess

2025
01:47:19,739 --> 01:47:23,489
we'll need to do it that's not as

2026
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,900
tripoli as you as you as you think but

2027
01:47:23,489 --> 01:47:26,909
anyway I think that's that's that I

2028
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,348
think it's pretty clear here we are

2029
01:47:26,909 --> 01:47:32,249
gonna do this we could do something with

2030
01:47:28,349 --> 01:47:34,739
abyss document and so I think we'll

2031
01:47:32,249 --> 01:47:38,909
follow I'll come out with you know

2032
01:47:34,739 --> 01:47:43,018
assuming that sets Creek good slow gets

2033
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:45,570
done then I will come out and come out

2034
01:47:43,019 --> 01:47:47,400
with the the individual draft and then

2035
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:50,400
we'll figure out at that point a

2036
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:53,280
decision about what what tech steps okay

2037
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:56,699
um is there another slide sorry this I

2038
01:47:53,280 --> 01:48:06,398
see next slide how maybe oh yes oh yes

2039
01:47:56,699 --> 01:48:10,360
we are out of time so yeah okay we'd

2040
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:13,030
oh yeah because you mentioned the idea

2041
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,860
of security about and the tons of yeah

2042
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:18,070
maybe we should do that from before

2043
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:20,648
doubt at same time so that's good

2044
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:23,709
maybe we'll discuss I think I summarized

2045
01:48:20,649 --> 01:48:25,989
this this discard make an alternate

2046
01:48:23,709 --> 01:48:28,119
proposal because the proposal I made

2047
01:48:25,989 --> 01:48:30,879
here is probably not valid because of

2048
01:48:28,119 --> 01:48:42,009
what time so our awesome is available

2049
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:47,439
list okay okay yeah if you could do this

2050
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:51,369
in five tom has a quick one too oh you

2051
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:57,599
meant what were you you were just at you

2052
01:48:51,369 --> 01:49:00,219
right no this fall hold on hold on -

2053
01:48:57,599 --> 01:49:04,079
where were you integrity right data

2054
01:49:00,219 --> 01:49:11,199
reduction very - you got a second second

2055
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:20,978
okay good you're on okay so I can do

2056
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:32,289
works okay just what do you want to do

2057
01:49:20,979 --> 01:49:35,559
okay so I'm trying to add some new stuff

2058
01:49:32,289 --> 01:49:38,018
in the NFS protocol related to the

2059
01:49:35,559 --> 01:49:40,419
current state of the storage where

2060
01:49:38,019 --> 01:49:43,499
everybody's running around in circles to

2061
01:49:40,419 --> 01:49:46,179
increase data reduction in order to make

2062
01:49:43,499 --> 01:49:48,550
storage cheaper because the media is

2063
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:55,119
very expensive the flash media that it's

2064
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:58,229
used and also the new media can use

2065
01:49:55,119 --> 01:50:02,739
memory so it can change the entire

2066
01:49:58,229 --> 01:50:07,030
mechanics of the server doing data

2067
01:50:02,739 --> 01:50:09,218
reduction so I you I'm gonna look at two

2068
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:15,249
use cases one use the normal scales with

2069
01:50:09,219 --> 01:50:17,499
nfsv4 to which assume that there is

2070
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:18,370
access to the external attributes of the

2071
01:50:17,499 --> 01:50:21,070
file if

2072
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:24,220
the goods are still supported and then

2073
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:27,219
the back end identified the file system

2074
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:29,860
block which is part of the specific file

2075
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:32,290
and then it applies data reduction

2076
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:35,019
according to that that's the simpler

2077
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:37,900
case the second case would be also

2078
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:40,630
interested because we nvme is big is

2079
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:43,599
also very important media and there is a

2080
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:48,220
Gaussian via me protocol that

2081
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:50,350
Christoph introduced and I think it's it

2082
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:52,330
has value if he has merit and I ever

2083
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:56,530
surprised that it was for he was busy

2084
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:58,990
because otherwise so in this case there

2085
01:50:56,530 --> 01:51:03,910
is some communication on the in the

2086
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:06,160
block level the motivation is that you

2087
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:08,530
know the external attribute if they

2088
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:13,660
would be possible to be used it would be

2089
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:16,240
a easy way to add new function and also

2090
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:19,570
we can add in principally two parameters

2091
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:22,450
so it could be little bit more than you

2092
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:25,240
can use on a park but it could be easier

2093
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:27,550
if you can enlist and attributes now

2094
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:30,340
what's missing is the user information

2095
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:34,060
little data reduction that arrays cannot

2096
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:37,030
now and to explain attributes we can

2097
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:42,300
come communicate to the engine that does

2098
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:47,650
the data reduction the idea that we are

2099
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:50,200
promoting in our draft is to enable a

2100
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:52,389
way to communicate between the file

2101
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:56,970
layer on the client to the block layer

2102
01:51:52,390 --> 01:52:00,670
that does data reduction in the backend

2103
01:51:56,970 --> 01:52:04,210
there is a lot of data from analysts

2104
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:06,280
regarding typical data reduction for

2105
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:10,170
typical types of file and objects and

2106
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:14,349
that's in its good because it can be

2107
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:18,700
really known to the application to the

2108
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:22,090
user and application so user can add

2109
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:26,740
these attributes or by just by the

2110
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:28,660
extension that data that explains the

2111
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:30,490
quality of data reduction for different

2112
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:31,690
compression duplication for different

2113
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:36,160
types of file

2114
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:37,960
like you know JPEG files and all kind of

2115
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:41,830
files that they through the extension

2116
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:44,440
there is a list of potential data

2117
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:46,180
reduction so this will help that you

2118
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:49,089
know in a sense that for example if the

2119
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:51,070
data is not compressible not in the pool

2120
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:54,610
at all because it's already very much

2121
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:55,900
compressed it will increase the to

2122
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:58,630
improve the performance of the server

2123
01:52:55,900 --> 01:53:03,070
because it won't do work that it's a

2124
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:05,710
throw away so and we are thinking the

2125
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:07,509
most important case will be the nvme

2126
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:09,930
case because the media is expensive and

2127
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:13,990
the result or already a lot of servers

2128
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:15,580
NFS server simile that have support and

2129
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:18,519
GME and they sell in here me so I think

2130
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:22,470
that's that's why I went back to the

2131
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:26,290
protocol that Christophe started and I

2132
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:28,840
think it has value it has married again

2133
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:31,150
I cannot ask her stuff to continue so as

2134
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:37,180
I said I am interested to take over

2135
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:38,650
whatever find a way to use it and I hope

2136
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:41,530
that the fact that it was expired

2137
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:43,960
doesn't make a difference and again I

2138
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:46,719
would like to see if we can approach

2139
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:51,190
Christophe at least to ask to see if he

2140
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:56,500
is interested or not but if not I am

2141
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:58,240
interested so what we need we need a way

2142
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:59,890
to communicate data reduction

2143
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:04,030
characteristics for a client to server

2144
01:53:59,890 --> 01:54:07,390
either because the extension of the file

2145
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:11,650
will tell us what type of file is all by

2146
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:14,050
there is a way because files that are

2147
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:18,429
impact for example other videos they

2148
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:23,020
have some metadata in the file itself

2149
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:27,790
which the user can read and transfer to

2150
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:29,530
the as an attribute and by that enable

2151
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:32,590
the all the types the files are same

2152
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:36,570
type to have a specific type of data

2153
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:43,560
reduction again these are something

2154
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:45,990
samples from analysts now I understand

2155
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:50,070
the problem with the extent attribute I

2156
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:53,040
thought that maybe it could be

2157
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:54,599
acceptable but I in light of what we

2158
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:57,150
discussed before I think that's a

2159
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:59,160
problem because if people if it's

2160
01:54:57,150 --> 01:55:01,379
there's no implementation why should

2161
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:04,050
they be a new implementation for the

2162
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:07,800
reduction attributes it's questionable

2163
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:09,990
what I would follow the consensus and I

2164
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:12,120
think that that's something that there

2165
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:15,809
are ways for example for a simplified

2166
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:19,110
model using just normal attributes but

2167
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:22,470
I'm you know I'm not sure that is enough

2168
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:25,580
because if you don't achieve much people

2169
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:31,740
don't use it so you need to get in

2170
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:37,920
important improvement otherwise so again

2171
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:41,460
I'm I'm just saying major points so this

2172
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:43,350
is some proposal in principle I didn't I

2173
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:46,650
strategy to write the protocol but I

2174
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:48,420
stopped because David was he's right he

2175
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:50,910
was right first let's see if it's

2176
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:53,670
interest and if we want to move on with

2177
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:56,880
this either as a private or working

2178
01:55:53,670 --> 01:56:01,080
group I don't know but those are some

2179
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:04,980
ideas it's not necessarily a solution so

2180
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:07,530
what I would like to ask first of all

2181
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:10,650
the the major question should the data

2182
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:14,540
reduction attributes extend or others

2183
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:19,349
Eddie to nfsv4 protocol first question

2184
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:21,120
so Tom Hanks hammer specs so I think

2185
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:24,540
some things you need to pull out here

2186
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:27,690
one that I heard here that I didn't hear

2187
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:30,269
in reading the draft or earlier is that

2188
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:34,620
you are saying the TR attributes are

2189
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:36,360
user-defined right yes so you need to

2190
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:38,630
make that point because that points out

2191
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:42,509
why you need extended attributes and not

2192
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:44,760
satyrs yeah okay okay so I leave it to

2193
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:46,310
us because he was the huh no I'm just

2194
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,290
I'm just trying to say that's an

2195
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:50,450
in consideration for why you do not want

2196
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:52,670
patters is because you have to let the

2197
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:54,740
users define them yeah and but even if

2198
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:58,480
you sixth at Exeter so you have to

2199
01:56:54,740 --> 01:57:02,570
define how the the server and the client

2200
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:04,639
understand that this X adder you call

2201
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:09,170
alpha means the same thing for both of

2202
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:11,690
them yes okay and then the you know the

2203
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:15,470
final thing is if you do want X adders

2204
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:17,919
of course the X headers that marked but

2205
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:20,590
the protocol never got implemented

2206
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:22,820
endless we won't let them go forward

2207
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:25,010
this go forward if you don't do the X

2208
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:27,799
hat or stuff right there has been a

2209
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:30,500
permutation so yeah so that's one thing

2210
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:32,240
that I consider by the way but I needed

2211
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:34,790
some consensus because that you know

2212
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:36,620
there's a certain point where I want to

2213
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:39,550
be sure that I'm going the right task so

2214
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:41,990
it can be becoming a work a good proper

2215
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:43,610
document that's all that's my goal

2216
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:47,420
currently I can keep it private for a

2217
01:57:43,610 --> 01:57:50,000
while let's say one two revisions but if

2218
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:53,630
there's no interest then I will you know

2219
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:57,380
it's from my perspective it's kind of I

2220
01:57:53,630 --> 01:58:00,170
want to make a you know promote

2221
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:03,410
promotion of this data reduction area so

2222
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:06,560
I have out the others ideas also related

2223
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:09,380
to this the fact that currently the host

2224
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:10,970
could be the client could be like a

2225
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:15,050
client that could be in the cloud so

2226
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:16,400
that's another thing that okay so the

2227
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:18,650
question you should become a working

2228
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:20,570
group my question is simpler first of

2229
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:25,429
all do you think it has any value should

2230
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:28,040
I continue or maybe is a private until I

2231
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:29,360
fix all the things that you asked or you

2232
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:31,490
want me to drop it that's alright I

2233
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:33,920
think you should go ahead with it you

2234
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:36,980
you you have an interesting use case you

2235
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:39,770
just have to develop yeah why why you

2236
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:43,400
should go with X adders or white go F

2237
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:45,560
adders yeah you have to understand I

2238
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:48,049
wasn't active for about eight years and

2239
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,150
this groups I forgot so I had to bring

2240
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:53,390
something at least to know that it's

2241
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:55,009
it's of interest you know I I'm busy

2242
01:58:53,390 --> 01:58:56,720
let's say I'm not I don't have spare

2243
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:59,360
time not to do it but I think it's

2244
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:00,179
important so especially that the media

2245
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:02,969
is getting

2246
01:59:00,179 --> 01:59:09,659
it's expensive and it's not gonna get so

2247
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:10,500
cheap ever so and uh sure yeah okay one

2248
01:59:09,659 --> 01:59:13,559
thing I think you should be careful

2249
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:14,909
clear about is you're working on two

2250
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:21,739
things yeah I'm working

2251
01:59:14,909 --> 01:59:25,920
possibly reviving them via me and this

2252
01:59:21,739 --> 01:59:28,379
thing they may have interactions but

2253
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:33,120
there have to be done separately because

2254
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:37,739
yes yes PMS thing is before that one and

2255
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:39,870
this thing is for that too yes I agree

2256
01:59:37,739 --> 01:59:41,489
with that in fact in fact the use case

2257
01:59:39,870 --> 01:59:43,980
first use case is the most important

2258
01:59:41,489 --> 01:59:48,419
that I want to address but you know it's

2259
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:53,190
because the the PMF s could have a value

2260
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:56,250
also for nvme I thought to mention this

2261
01:59:53,190 --> 02:00:00,269
so I will do this I will move that one

2262
01:59:56,250 --> 02:00:04,590
further maybe independently of this and

2263
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:06,960
then when it's yeah so lucky so when

2264
02:00:04,590 --> 02:00:08,640
it's ready maybe you will match both and

2265
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:14,780
will make them I don't know that's

2266
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:17,520
something that I check labor work on so

2267
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:19,769
are you using these extended attributes

2268
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,550
they give commands to the underlying

2269
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:24,870
block storage

2270
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:28,080
no no I'm using this for the it's okay

2271
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:31,769
like a lot back so I have I can say if

2272
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:33,210
it's compressible the Dibble and say you

2273
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:35,400
are communicating with the underlying

2274
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:38,400
yeah yeah yeah that's a user way too

2275
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:41,730
that's that's something that we

2276
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:43,469
expressly forbid with musics extended

2277
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:45,389
attributes I believe they're they're

2278
02:00:43,469 --> 02:00:47,850
meant to be a big storage but they're

2279
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:50,219
not meant to be used as an i/o cuddle as

2280
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:53,310
a side channel yeah yeah I understand

2281
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:55,080
that so that's one reason why we might

2282
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:57,420
really need to go with a fatter and not

2283
02:00:55,080 --> 02:01:00,390
with an extended attribute yeah I look I

2284
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:03,360
I I thought it's the easiest way for for

2285
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:07,770
me to work on both cases the nvme and P

2286
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:11,730
NFS normal so that was my thinking but I

2287
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:13,119
didn't have a concrete conclusion so

2288
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:14,739
that's why I came and

2289
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:16,449
yeah and it's easier for us to extend

2290
02:01:14,739 --> 02:01:18,308
the protocol if you're defining new

2291
02:01:16,449 --> 02:01:20,829
patters rather than defining new

2292
02:01:18,309 --> 02:01:23,050
operations yeah well I'm not defined

2293
02:01:20,829 --> 02:01:27,308
operation of defining parameters of the

2294
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:32,860
data so in a sense the list said get me

2295
02:01:27,309 --> 02:01:37,979
a turn oh yeah I know I we are

2296
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:53,018
officially over our working group slot

2297
02:01:37,979 --> 02:01:59,919
do you yes we continue it but let's take

2298
02:01:53,019 --> 02:02:07,149
this on this is a quickie yeah that's

2299
02:01:59,919 --> 02:02:10,329
when he said I'm getting you there all

2300
02:02:07,149 --> 02:02:14,320
right so I've extended my delegation

2301
02:02:10,329 --> 02:02:16,570
state ID paper the major difference from

2302
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:22,469
last time is the layout wait we cache

2303
02:02:16,570 --> 02:02:24,268
consistency operation so it's just cool

2304
02:02:22,469 --> 02:02:30,969
whoops

2305
02:02:24,269 --> 02:02:33,459
so what my model is when we have for

2306
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:36,249
example Echo food a bar we have an open

2307
02:02:33,459 --> 02:02:38,438
layout get it goes to the MDS we have to

2308
02:02:36,249 --> 02:02:41,019
get device info goes the MDS we have a

2309
02:02:38,439 --> 02:02:45,219
right of three bytes which goes to the

2310
02:02:41,019 --> 02:02:47,949
DF and then when we start to close the

2311
02:02:45,219 --> 02:02:50,739
file with a layout return set at or

2312
02:02:47,949 --> 02:02:53,978
deleg return and get adder well in order

2313
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:57,129
to check the consistency of the file to

2314
02:02:53,979 --> 02:03:00,010
the client we have to also send a get

2315
02:02:57,129 --> 02:03:01,629
out or two from the MDS to the DES in

2316
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:07,389
order to determine that the RAI

2317
02:03:01,629 --> 02:03:10,479
succeeded and this is adds to the

2318
02:03:07,389 --> 02:03:12,429
round-trip time of the application and

2319
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:15,070
you can see with an echo I don't want to

2320
02:03:12,429 --> 02:03:19,800
have to take 30 seconds in order to do

2321
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:19,799
the operation and so

2322
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:27,240
the adder caching that we introduced in

2323
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:30,030
the earlier version doesn't help us

2324
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:31,800
because it only provides the end time in

2325
02:03:30,030 --> 02:03:34,410
the a time of the metadata file not of

2326
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:37,920
the data file and we still have to go

2327
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:41,309
compare what the instance file has and

2328
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:44,190
so we notice that the right has week

2329
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:46,580
cache consistency when it's b3 and what

2330
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:49,290
we would do is introduce a new operation

2331
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:52,350
layout we cache consistency which sends

2332
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:56,519
that information back to the MDS and it

2333
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:58,230
removes the need for the get adder the

2334
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,650
other operations layout return layout

2335
02:03:58,230 --> 02:04:01,919
commit

2336
02:03:58,650 --> 02:04:04,080
don't provide this ability to do week

2337
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,520
cache consistency and also it's the

2338
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:07,950
quickest way I know to get this new

2339
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:10,050
operation in I'm being honest I'm being

2340
02:04:07,950 --> 02:04:17,070
bluntly honest it's really fast for me

2341
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:18,750
to get draft you know what the we agreed

2342
02:04:17,070 --> 02:04:21,120
for the previous draft to be a working

2343
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:22,860
group item I added something major so I

2344
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,540
didn't make it a working group item I

2345
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:27,210
want to make it a working group item

2346
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:32,460
after this drop and there's my three

2347
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:34,110
minutes questions I went really fast so

2348
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:39,360
now I can tell my boss I present it he

2349
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:43,080
wants to know that you get that I'm

2350
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:45,450
recording okay so that's it

2351
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:47,460
there's no opportunity for wrap-up I AB

2352
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:49,230
the minutes I'll be posting those

2353
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:52,500
through our website if you haven't

2354
02:04:49,230 --> 02:04:53,759
signed the blue sheet sign it if you

2355
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:55,320
just walked in the room for some other

2356
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:00,660
meeting feel free to sign the blue sheet

2357
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:02,929
anyway thanks guys have a great

2358
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,930
conference
