1
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,350
okay let's go ahead and get started if

2
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,470
you're having a side conversation we'd

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,350
appreciate if you do that in the hallway

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,229
this is quick we have two hours today

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,140
and I believe two hours tomorrow or and

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,570
a half two hours tomorrow we're having a

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,629
bit of an issue with the screens in the

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:40,929
room so we're gonna ask you to follow

9
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:44,199
along that way now yes so we're gonna

10
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:46,600
ask folks to follow along in on your own

11
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,780
laptops we don't have a tremendous

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,039
amount of presentation or visual aid

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,019
sorry

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:58,420
um this one is and it's fine right there

15
00:00:53,019 --> 00:01:13,750
but these ones are not working and that

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:22,060
one was working but it works and it

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:27,150
worked when we first came around we hope

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:39,430
you like this shade of green okay

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:41,890
so I'm going to add lib the note well do

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,090
we have scribes we have and for the

21
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,520
entire session thank you

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,230
I think we're brian in the etherpad

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,340
describing for us and if you want to

24
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,840
help them out please do so back of us

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,730
Tommy Thank You Tommy thank you so we

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,840
have Jeb described we have ascribed well

27
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,040
go ahead and circulate the blue sheets

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,930
please sign them our agenda is pretty

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,970
monolithic today we're going to have a

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:12,999
brief discussion of the hackathon the

31
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,379
Interop event excuse me and then we're

32
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,689
gonna get straight into issue discussion

33
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,739
we're gonna follow the practice that we

34
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,900
started

35
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,400
I think a couple of interrupts are in

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,709
terms ago now we're we're just going to

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,620
go through the issues list and try and

38
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,810
address each issue as well as we can

39
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,299
that will carry into Wednesday and we'll

40
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,720
wrap up with some brief discussion of

41
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,790
next steps future planning and if we

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,799
have time we may have one or two half

43
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,319
time permits presentations although I

44
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,489
think it's pretty likely we won't just

45
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:49,929
because we have a fair number of issues

46
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:55,389
open any agenda bashing it keeps on No

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,370
okay so if the screens were working you

48
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:01,090
would now see a lovely slide that starts

49
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,560
with a note well we have the small in

50
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,349
the middle if your eye says especially

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,090
good if you're not familiar with this

52
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,920
concept please use your favorite

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,560
internet search engine to search for

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,510
IETF note well that should take you to a

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,790
description of the terms under which we

56
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,709
all participate here regarding important

57
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,358
things like intellectual property and

58
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,459
and and how you share it or how you

59
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,620
disclose it and your daugh requirements

60
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,329
to do so also things like the anti

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,389
harassment procedures we expect this to

62
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:31,840
be a professional environment copyright

63
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:34,209
patents so forth and so on there's a lot

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,199
of process document policy documents

65
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,099
around that so if you're not familiar

66
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,810
with it please do familiarize yourself

67
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:47,078
with it it's important to what we do

68
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:49,690
here there's no screen okay so let's go

69
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:54,579
into the issues sorry let's go into that

70
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:57,280
a hackathon report large slides up from

71
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,690
the but while my quotes the slides that

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,129
I showed at the end of the hackathon one

73
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,440
thing I want to mention as an email to

74
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,849
list about it so we got feedback that

75
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,650
it's hard for people who aren't

76
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,959
following like every single day for

77
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,489
several hours to find out what things

78
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,409
are happening related to quick there are

79
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,840
not like chart at work at the moment but

80
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:19,510
a sort of interest and we started a wiki

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,370
on the github wiki page where we collect

82
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,560
those and that collection basically has

83
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,900
like a little you know blurb on what is

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,310
this thing and then where do I go for

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,799
more information and where do I go to

86
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,449
participate so if you have something

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,740
that's quick related there's a few

88
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,900
things that we know about it they are on

89
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,879
there that could use some detailing but

90
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,840
if you if you I interested in working on

91
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,340
something or you are working on

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,138
something it isn't there feel free to

93
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,109
add it and help other people find that

94
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,699
work we don't as Mark said gonna have

95
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,379
for a lot of time to talk about this in

96
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,999
the working group session because we are

97
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,499
still struggling with the issue list but

98
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,749
that that shouldn't stop people from

99
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:55,569
having five meanings on things they want

100
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:57,789
to do in the future right and it keeps

101
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:06,159
flickering here not so you can order the

102
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:08,009
next few slides not that one right so

103
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,620
this is this is our beloved

104
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,509
interruptible Docs sheet which is

105
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,539
getting very hard to read because we had

106
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:18,849
19 implementations that participated

107
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:23,469
most of them both have a client and a

108
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:26,529
server you see some white rose and and

109
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:28,419
columns that is because the - 22 drafts

110
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:30,189
dropped really really close to the inner

111
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,240
up and some stacks simply haven't had

112
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:37,389
the time to update from - 20 but we

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,659
expect that to change that one new thing

114
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,520
is that we have now realize of tests if

115
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,110
you will where we could record the

116
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,008
results in three lines the third line

117
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,050
being HTTP three related tests and in

118
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,610
the past we just sort of had one test

119
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,979
that Bailey said you know if I send you

120
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,310
an h3 request - again an h3 response now

121
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:59,800
there is a few more feature tests and we

122
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:04,060
expect that to broaden out further in

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,569
the future but the summary again is that

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,550
we're still lacking implementation and

125
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,889
inner up of some very very basic

126
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,339
features like like I would say half the

127
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:18,180
stack still don't do key updates and

128
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,379
migration is still quite untested

129
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,409
recovery is looking a little bit better

130
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:26,459
I'll get to that in a minute but we we

131
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:29,529
certainly not where we thought we were

132
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,689
part of that as I think that also with

133
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,189
this draft called the invariance that

134
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,499
I've decided I'm just gonna call the

135
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:41,050
variants for now until we actually stop

136
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:43,419
changing it so the implementations are

137
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,270
still not at a state where they can you

138
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,780
know concentrate on the

139
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,580
feature Interop it's just you know

140
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,559
keeping up with the change churn that

141
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,849
that takes the effort right

142
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,380
one thing that's on the positive side

143
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,620
does the next slide if you can go down

144
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,390
one more that can see that it's a graph

145
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,550
oh wow they can't see it because what

146
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:07,950
the hell happened there so Jana and

147
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,770
Martin see men have worked on a little

148
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,650
side project that lets you plug your

149
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,609
existing quick client and server

150
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,380
implementation in a simulated ns3

151
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,760
topology that defines a network topology

152
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,540
and it also defines simulated cross

153
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,420
traffic so you can now do repeatable

154
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,520
recovery testing which is great and

155
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,050
Robin Marx and Victor have two tools

156
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
that are basically equivalent and you

157
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,800
can translate from one to the other debt

158
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,539
to generate a log file and that you can

159
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,450
visualize and what's on the slide there

160
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,990
is a visualization of transfer that's

161
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:45,450
happening from one quick client to one

162
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,330
quick server through a simulated in a

163
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,530
sweet apology with cross-traffic and and

164
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,729
it looks pretty cool and you can see on

165
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,349
the bottom but you probably can't but

166
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,140
there's the you know the sea salt

167
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:59,100
pattern in the ITT that you would expect

168
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,180
to see if two things are doing reno

169
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,800
style congestion control on their

170
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,240
meeting in the queue somewhere so this

171
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,530
is really cool and this now lets people

172
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,870
that have an interest in congestion

173
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,369
control but maybe are not intimately

174
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,290
familiar with the different logging

175
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,570
formats of the quick implementations to

176
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,550
actually play around and see if they can

177
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,930
improve things for us so this is I think

178
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,730
it's a nice milestone it's early days

179
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,620
for this still more work will be needed

180
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm pretty sure that Martin and John I

181
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,030
would love for people to help with this

182
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,980
especially students but if you want to

183
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,650
do congestion tour with Creek it's

184
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,770
easier now so that's not that's a

185
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,150
highlight for me from the hackathon any

186
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,150
feedback from anybody else

187
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:48,640
I see mark is not here and it'll really

188
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
close to the microphone because you're

189
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,270
very hot yet do you hear me

190
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,800
just to say that there was a lot of work

191
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:59,110
on the spin beat table - about good on

192
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,089
her the acoustics are really bad because

193
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,290
keep the monitor speakers or point your

194
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:07,920
way and not our way

195
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,920
so if you speak louder we will hear you

196
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,250
yeah just to say quickly that on the

197
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,260
spin big table during the Academy that

198
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,180
was a lot all a lot of work on the

199
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,370
push-off cronies and different

200
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:27,310
instrumentation to miss your packet loss

201
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:30,690
on tone thank you so one thing I think

202
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:34,300
maybe it's worth spending just a minute

203
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,020
physical face to face Interop versus

204
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,089
thank you

205
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,390
physical face to face interrupts versus

206
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,160
the virtual interrupts do we have any as

207
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,470
a group any any feelings about which is

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,600
more effective or whether we should

209
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,860
focus um one or the other

210
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:53,260
hey thoughts their large any thoughts

211
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,060
what I've heard is that that if you're

212
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,850
in the North American time zones the

213
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,250
virtual networks work quite well it's a

214
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,300
little bit more difficult if you're not

215
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,570
but that's to be expected

216
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,010
um I I certainly think we don't want to

217
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,300
stop doing the virtual interrupts I

218
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,089
think the question is do we want to

219
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,959
reduce the frequency of the physical

220
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:16,170
ones that because they're obviously

221
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:18,760
costly personally given the result but I

222
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,550
not sure if we should at the moment but

223
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,589
that's one opinion all right Eric

224
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,819
Kinnear Apple so I think the please

225
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,730
closer to the mic it's really hard for

226
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,529
us to hear I think the virtual

227
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,330
interrupts are great and it's nice to

228
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,860
have kind of intermediate deadlines to

229
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,209
help move people forward and give

230
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,400
everybody a date where we say yes we'll

231
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:38,770
be online and that's a little painful

232
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,180
for people in other time zones but the

233
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,470
face to face interrupts there's nothing

234
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,900
quite like sitting down next to somebody

235
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,790
and actually looking side-by-side and

236
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,130
comparing and saying okay this is

237
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,449
exactly what's happening and so I think

238
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,210
we've been able to track down a number

239
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,770
of kind of

240
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,540
finicky weird issues that we wouldn't

241
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,819
have otherwise found when we were face

242
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,620
to face and given where we are in terms

243
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,730
of how the implementations are coming

244
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,680
along I think we're in a place where we

245
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,029
probably still need some that but well

246
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,260
you're all up there if you have any

247
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,700
thoughts about whether it's still

248
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,350
necessary to have two days or the

249
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,000
face-to-face that'll be interesting as

250
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,940
well we're on the interrupts two days

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,750
versus fewer or more two days versus oh

252
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:19,100
okay either I it's too good what you

253
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,050
want to have one what you want to have

254
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:26,180
three I'm David's can Ozzie cool so plus

255
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,979
one to everything Eric said I think

256
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,880
there's a lot of value in both the

257
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,980
virtual in drops and the in-person ones

258
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,260
if only like we all have day jobs and

259
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,149
having some like magic deadlines that

260
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,560
force us to get stuff done match the

261
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:44,959
dress is a really good thing and

262
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,109
regarding the in-person meetings I think

263
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:51,020
London was the first time at least in my

264
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,300
personal experience that the Interop

265
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,060
became more useful than the issue

266
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,699
discussion so maybe from now expending

267
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,589
more time on Interop could be a good

268
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,180
thing and also I think he might also

269
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,520
just happen naturally because we have

270
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,189
less and less issues documents are

271
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,600
getting closer to ready that that was

272
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,630
the hope right that we would eventually

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,040
maybe stopped needing working group on

274
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,600
meetings and we could just do interrupts

275
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,730
because they are also easier to host

276
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,940
because it's not all the people will

277
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:25,279
show up for football cut all cool

278
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:28,790
parsley I like to ask people to keep the

279
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,000
in person in terms as we have done

280
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,209
because it is extremely difficult for

281
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,160
people living in files easier to attend

282
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:40,160
an interrupt that's mainly happening

283
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,860
across the Atlantic Ocean because it's

284
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,860
the opposite the website was involved a

285
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,250
very brief comment on the two-day thing

286
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,170
I think it's really nice to be able to

287
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,550
discover some issues and then go spend

288
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,719
the evening fixing them and then come

289
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,729
back the next day and keep going so I

290
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,270
wouldn't go less than two days but more

291
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,180
might be fine Lucas party Clyde back um

292
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,379
just to reiterate Eric's point it might

293
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,929
not be that

294
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,669
we work on those issues but the the

295
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,309
attendees that the face-to-face

296
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:12,199
interrupt channeling a team that are

297
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,389
remote and they may be in a different

298
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,910
time zone so being able to have that at

299
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,410
another day at least to then come back

300
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,549
the next day and retest

301
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,728
is really useful Thank You that thank

302
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,869
you that's really good feedback

303
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:38,979
anything else on the hackathon or the

304
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:42,649
interrupts yeah so uh related to that

305
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:44,149
excuse me we are at this point planning

306
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,789
and starting to plan an interim meeting

307
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,079
in the September October time frame it's

308
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:50,329
pretty clear that we're gonna need to

309
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,118
discuss issues it's pretty clear that we

310
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,289
need to do more interrupts work and so I

311
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,399
know that we've been doing this for a

312
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,598
while and then some people are getting a

313
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,379
little exhausting but we need at least

314
00:13:56,599 --> 00:14:02,629
one more in our rotation you know

315
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:04,149
historically rotated when one interrupts

316
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:07,069
or in one interim meeting in

317
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,739
asia-pacific one in North America and

318
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:11,329
one in Europe and so in our rotation the

319
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:13,729
next one should be in North America

320
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,159
we're having a lot of trouble finding a

321
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:18,019
host for that meeting we have a few

322
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,209
folks looking for rooms and their

323
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:21,559
companies this week and we're hoping

324
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:25,488
that that will eventuate something that

325
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:27,919
we can announce to you in the by the end

326
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:31,699
of the week early next week but if you

327
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,720
have a meeting room at your company that

328
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,849
you think is suitable for our

329
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,929
requirements and if you're not clear

330
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,319
about what those requirements are please

331
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,999
come to talk to lars and i we're really

332
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:42,709
looking for more facilities where we can

333
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:44,269
host these meetings it's it's kind of a

334
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,059
tough set of requirements and that's why

335
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:49,399
we're having trouble out there so yeah

336
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:54,439
if you know something please do come to

337
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,689
us but with any small amount of luck one

338
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:57,738
of the avenues we're chasing will become

339
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:00,978
fruitful and we'll have an announcement

340
00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:03,139
of an Interop slash interim meeting in

341
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:05,349
September October I think right now

342
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,569
we're looking at the week of October 7

343
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:13,089
but we're also open to other dates

344
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,380
potentially they also know

345
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,910
we are supposed to present on the

346
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:30,439
Chromebook if you that's possible

347
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:52,310
because that apparently works it takes

348
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:59,360
crumpled Samsung oh are you sharing

349
00:15:52,310 --> 00:16:00,500
protective media okay right so we're

350
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,610
gonna need a second to get into the

351
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:33,589
right state here I don't like I don't

352
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:43,069
know Google people to be a part time for

353
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:48,199
Google co-chair okay so let's not join

354
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:49,790
you get up today so this is kind of the

355
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,010
the project board on github that we've

356
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:57,920
been using to keep an eye on the issues

357
00:16:52,010 --> 00:17:00,110
lists and if I look at this so uh as we

358
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,599
mentioned last time Loras and eyes

359
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,339
regularly triage new issues to figure

360
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,520
out if their design issues editorial

361
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,928
issues or they need to be thought about

362
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,020
and discussed a little more before we

363
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,250
except for this issues the current

364
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,230
design issues list is the one we're

365
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,290
going to be interested in today how do i

366
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,290
scroll know oh

367
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:30,860
okay I'll just drag and so you can see

368
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:34,310
we have 22 design issues open its 23

369
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,550
because the node up here we did this at

370
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:40,070
our last okay we did this in our last

371
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,960
interim meeting and as you can see we

372
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,460
assigned a number of these issues to

373
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,410
different people ought to go off and

374
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,050
work a proposal based upon the

375
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,970
discussion we had at the interim meeting

376
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,290
and we were hoping we'd be able to close

377
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,510
on those at the time between that

378
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,800
meeting and now we still have a lot of

379
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,530
those open because a lot of those

380
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,500
proposals have not eventuated and so i

381
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,540
think what we're going to do today is

382
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,030
discuss the newer issues and try and get

383
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,800
a better understanding of them and

384
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,980
assign an owner to them to come up with

385
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,990
a a PR or a proposal for the disposition

386
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,210
of that issue but for the ones where we

387
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,680
already assigned an owner our question

388
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,190
is going to be have you made any

389
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,340
progress

390
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,890
do we need to assign a new owner we

391
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,530
really need the participation of the

392
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:27,410
folks who are part of this process to

393
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:30,889
come forward and make these proposals to

394
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:33,950
be able to close this out I think not

395
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:36,380
now but if this keeps you know happening

396
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,380
we're gonna be closing some with no

397
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,630
action that we don't deem critical for

398
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,160
some definition of critical because it's

399
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,400
easy it's still too easy to open new

400
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,930
issues and do the follow through isn't

401
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,250
quite there this is not a fault of the

402
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,400
editors right this is the fault of

403
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:55,430
everybody that that is opening more

404
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,690
issues than we can close and it and we

405
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,220
always get the question know when are we

406
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,980
going to get to some new cool stuff like

407
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,660
media or multipath or or something else

408
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,000
and the answer is when the issues list

409
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,400
is under control and and it's not under

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,340
control and and we always say we know by

411
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,840
the next meeting hopefully but it's not

412
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,000
been happening right and and to that you

413
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,320
know point earlier of exhaustion if we

414
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,840
keep on doing this for another year or

415
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,740
two I'm concerned I think we're

416
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,000
concerned that we're gonna lose

417
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,760
implementers we're gonna lose interest

418
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,680
and the effort will fail and so we need

419
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,800
to focus and get these final few issues

420
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,510
I mean it's 22 issues it's not that many

421
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,070
considering how many we've closed how

422
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,340
very they

423
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,960
many we've closed to date so let's do do

424
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,820
a final push and get these done so we

425
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,350
can really get a good set of drafts out

426
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,669
that we can start thinking about working

427
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:49,120
with the last call on yes I said working

428
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:54,340
group last call

429
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:57,560
not yet don't be so self congratulatory

430
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,730
hey if we can get consensus to close all

431
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,260
these issues we can close all these

432
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:08,540
issues today I don't think we're gonna

433
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:10,310
get there see so let's go ahead and go

434
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,379
through these if you're aware of a

435
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,710
dependency or a relationship to another

436
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,110
issue please say so these aren't in any

437
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,340
particularly special order but we'll

438
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:24,790
discuss her and try and get as much time

439
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:26,570
as possible first 127 92 Martin seaman

440
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,230
do you want to tell us a little bit

441
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:34,129
about this issue

442
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:37,660
I can't scroll i I can't scroll where's

443
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,660
this crowbar hmm

444
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:50,700
no Sean's volunteered to take this one

445
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:56,720
this Sean Parton Sivan dude do you have

446
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:59,570
a solution of this Sean because I don't

447
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,750
and I've thought about it a little bit

448
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,649
can we do another one first he's asking

449
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,260
extremely difficult to hear you guys

450
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,960
yeah up you're very sorry our project um

451
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:14,850
I thought about this a little bit not a

452
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:18,570
lot and it's hard and I'm not sure that

453
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:22,980
it's worth addressing without anything

454
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:24,090
other than maybe text I'd like to do I

455
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,650
hear you correctly that you think that

456
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:29,340
this is an issue we should not try to

457
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,750
address in version one quick um that may

458
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,629
be the case I'd like a little bit more

459
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:39,300
time to think about it but at current

460
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:40,530
pace I'd rather not so I guess I scroll

461
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:46,980
I don't actually understand this issue

462
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:49,560
um um if we ever said it seems to be so

463
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,880
reading this first paragraph the fact

464
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,960
the key is computer we see that packet

465
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,420
as a side channel it might be used to

466
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,320
recover the head of protection key um if

467
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,020
it's possible recover the head of

468
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,490
protection key from measuring the cost

469
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,540
of computing it then we have problems

470
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,040
all up and down the stack because we're

471
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,850
constantly doing the wrecker can you

472
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,860
please speak directly into the

473
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,600
microphone yes if it's possible to cover

474
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,030
the head of crashing key from the cost

475
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,459
of computing yet of doing some other

476
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,480
computation or these computations and

477
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,270
we're problems all the way up and down

478
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,520
the stack ah yeah I don't I think that's

479
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,790
another statement of the problem yeah I

480
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,129
think the the problem is probably

481
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,170
limited to the fact that you learn when

482
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,610
a key update happens and might be

483
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,230
trigger line right but there's a perk

484
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,610
but if I'm reading if I'm reading the

485
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,230
next two paragraphs correctly is a

486
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,689
perfectly fine countermeasure which is

487
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:37,230
to pre-compute the next key and what you

488
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,120
do at the time you compute the at the

489
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,390
time of the previous or you do it the

490
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,600
background or packet loss in other ways

491
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,280
yeah um that's that's what I'm saying I

492
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,790
thought about this a little bit I don't

493
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,529
think it's worth doing anything much to

494
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,799
solve

495
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:59,440
whatever the problem is I mean I guess I

496
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,879
I guess I don't understand but what what

497
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,419
what is the problem it information is

498
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,380
attacker learning let's start with the

499
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:14,740
statement of within about hackers

500
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,700
morning okay I propose we not discuss

501
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,169
this till someone can tell you what the

502
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,820
attacker flirting yeah and so I Google I

503
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:23,679
was mostly gonna second Martin time but

504
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,049
I don't think we necessarily need to do

505
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,220
anything about this if we understand it

506
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,960
better maybe we can write it up in

507
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,960
security considerations besides that

508
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:48,370
okay that's that's Derek this is how

509
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,779
Lars gets killed Firefox we okay oh hey

510
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,139
that's actually bit better

511
00:23:49,779 --> 00:24:00,100
cool you may be disadvantaging these

512
00:23:53,139 --> 00:24:03,689
people here okay can cuz you how can you

513
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,689
still hear me okay okay cool

514
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:10,690
anyone want to speak up for for keeping

515
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,070
this as you open martin did you want

516
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:17,019
more time to think about this or are you

517
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,559
comfortable saying right now i'm happy

518
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:20,580
with

519
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,809
maybe martin say man if you want to

520
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,760
think about this more yourself and come

521
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,039
back with some proposed text but I'm

522
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,899
happy with saying the onus is on someone

523
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,669
else and we can close it here rather

524
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,439
than doing anything concrete

525
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,860
so you're saying security considerations

526
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,350
text if that if security considerations

527
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,928
text if such text materializes no I

528
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,990
Shawn who's put his name on this has

529
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:48,010
some ideas or if Martin who opened that

530
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:53,590
has some ideas I know I didn't see it I

531
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:55,690
don't want to hold this okay it hard to

532
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,760
India does anyone think we need more

533
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:02,649
than security considerations texts on

534
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,760
this okay that seems like the direction

535
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,760
will try and go into Jenna

536
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:12,430
and which are you do you want to mark

537
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,950
this as something other than design them

538
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:20,800
I can't understand a word you're saying

539
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:23,680
I want it as something of it

540
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,260
nice recommending quick feet well that

541
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,820
gets closed yeah well if it's me - it's

542
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,730
closed no it's not gonna get any text in

543
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,530
the document yeah but we take we do take

544
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,560
more requests for editorial suggestions

545
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,389
of the nature I'm a little uncomfortable

546
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,490
adding securities considerations text

547
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,600
through that mechanism okay we can

548
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,600
review it if it materializes

549
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,669
you ain't close issues I want to close

550
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,620
issues yeah yeah I don't have a bad idea

551
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,110
to have at this point if somebody's

552
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,149
volunteering to provide text for this I

553
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,260
think we should keep it open otherwise

554
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,040
you can't hear me

555
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:03,760
now we need a dollar whisper okay I'm

556
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:12,280
saying can you hear me now yeah

557
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:14,290
Lars can you hear me understand I think

558
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,810
so I'll make sure with Martin on on

559
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,360
closing closing stuff right and and sure

560
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,220
we can leave this open but that's not

561
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,350
really gonna get our issueless under

562
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,890
control rights so I mean unless unless

563
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:30,909
somebody puts up here then puts the are

564
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:32,320
together right I just want to make sure

565
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,420
that if we get the working group last

566
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,689
call and there's no text about this the

567
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,250
document that's not gonna come up again

568
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,910
as long as we're in that state let's go

569
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,910
ahead and close the issue

570
00:26:47,860 --> 00:27:01,419
when you write something tonight can we

571
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,980
have this discussion on the night please

572
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,570
sure it's important suggesting he'd

573
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,480
write something but not before September

574
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,740
probably I would say that then my

575
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,540
inclination would be to close the issue

576
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,870
and if you want to come up with some

577
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,100
text the editors can consider that and

578
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,209
if they think it's not editorial we can

579
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,110
bring it back to the group you need to

580
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,980
go to the Mike Martin

581
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:28,040
so Mountain please come to the mic I I

582
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:37,070
don't I don't agree this is M stack but

583
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:37,730
I'm willing to consider the fact to my

584
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,530
phone please

585
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,270
this is a timing side channel and we

586
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,639
need to resolve it I can't come up with

587
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,639
the PR until tomorrow but I can work on

588
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,020
it after this meeting

589
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,340
can I please state what the time inside

590
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:54,080
channel is because I don't understand it

591
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:56,090
yet I'm inside channel is that the spec

592
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,540
currently says that you compute the key

593
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,550
as soon as you receive a packet with the

594
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,290
with a new key face what is the attacker

595
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:07,790
learning what is the attacker learning

596
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:15,409
what information does the attacker learn

597
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:17,178
it's the same okay this isn't this is

598
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,580
okay this doesn't say packet number it

599
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:24,260
says we're cover the header protection

600
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:26,419
that is wrong yeah we have text about

601
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:31,580
this for the packet number two

602
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:35,650
correction so either it's not we agree

603
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,649
that the header protection key

604
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:45,830
so concretely we have a very clear

605
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,390
definition of what it means to do pack

606
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,800
remove packet protection and that

607
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,760
includes removing the head of protection

608
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:55,340
and Martin's point is that in the case

609
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,020
where you see that bit flip the middle

610
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,270
of that process contains a non constant

611
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:03,170
idle time operation which is generating

612
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:06,740
a new set of keys the fix would be to

613
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:09,020
generate the next set of keys some other

614
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,280
time okay the right information to the

615
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,679
attacker borings you're not telling me

616
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,490
the attack alone was the value of the

617
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:25,760
key base bit value the key take that

618
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:27,650
okay that's not what this says right I'm

619
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,230
not sure this is particularly serious or

620
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:35,450
anything but we okay maybe acknowledge

621
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:39,080
it that's all can we suggest that that

622
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:42,110
is off line and we'll deal with this

623
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,520
right okay so we're gonna do you sign it

624
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,050
from Sean I don't know why Sean it's

625
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,379
Sean's and we're gonna give it to Martin

626
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:51,500
seaman but Martin seaman I just wanna

627
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,620
can you nod or not nod the outcome here

628
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,140
is at most security consideration text

629
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,059
is that what you're thinking the outcome

630
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,630
would be at most security consideration

631
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:03,139
text not a protocol change do you agree

632
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,890
with that

633
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,720
he says probably yeah I think probably

634
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,640
yes though though we may change the

635
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,490
description of how a protection works to

636
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,920
avoid the you know I'm throwing

637
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,490
something but sure but but not an actual

638
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:25,760
protocol change yeah okay let's move on

639
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:26,809
then next Oh what happens there you get

640
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,240
to see mark learn how to use a

641
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:31,240
Chromebook badly

642
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500

thank you next up is 2670 remove active

644

mr. Donnegan I will find you'll find

646
00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:05,678
that there are slides on this question

647
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:07,890
in the materials ok right this is a fun

648
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,890
one

649

space when we do this one Oh

652
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:58,539
acknowledgment delay yeah can we get rid

653
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:04,620
of the notification and make it

654
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:04,620
fullscreen um next page please when you

655
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,830
know it's you need to use the arrow keys

656
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,500
rather than the space I don't know who

657
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,730
designed this system all right so we

658
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,280
have a number of options that we've been

659
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,490
discussing on the issue and it seemed

660
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,820
like it was not going to resolve on the

661
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,960
thread because we had weak preferences

662
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,210
in every direction it's one of those

663
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,590
wonderful scenarios where there's weak

664
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,860
preferences so I'm going to go through

665
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:36,610
the three options this is what Nick

666
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:40,240
proposed which is to remove the scaling

667
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:42,340
of the activate parameter those people

668
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,309
who are not aware of this we express the

669
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:47,020
time that the stack holds on to it

670
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:50,408
delays the acknowledgment of an ACK

671
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,210
eliciting packet and we express that in

672
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:54,400
microseconds but we have a scaling

673
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,770
parameter that's exchanged as a

674
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:02,110
transport parameter this one would say

675
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:04,720
remove that and the advantages of doing

676
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,809
that is it's much much simpler this

677
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,720
disadvantage here is that as a result

678
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:16,240
your encoding larger values for your

679
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:20,490
actally which will take one maybe for a

680
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,870
three more nacht it's when you encoded

681
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,640
I'll also point out here that if we

682
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,330
decide that this was a bad idea in

683
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,220
retrospect

684
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,580
adding a transport parameter back for

685
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,260
this one is super complicated so we

686
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,449
would be kind of committing to this

687
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:41,350
unless we wanted to revise the protocol

688
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:43,150
completely next play please option B you

689
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,908
might wanna hit the fullscreen e button

690
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:48,270
again and then I know what yeah that

691
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:48,270
might do it

692
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:57,560
terrible thing isn't it all right

693
00:33:51,860 --> 00:34:01,350
option B we express the a delay with a

694
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,970
thank you Mary with a scaling parameter

695
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,659
just like this is what we have in the in

696
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:11,429
the document today with a shift so it an

697
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:13,740
integer shift shift to the left 3 which

698
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,350
is a default our shift to the right when

699
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,540
you when you encode this one can reduce

700
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,239
the bytes on the wire it's very simple

701
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,070
to implement the number of gates that

702
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,529
you have to do to do this if your

703
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,270
concern about gates is trivial someone

704
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,130
pointed out the fact that if you really

705
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,320
have that few gates then you should

706
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:36,600
probably be roaring at delay Thank You

707
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,790
Roberta and it the disadvantage with

708
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,670
this is that if your native time unit is

709
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,560
not microseconds then you end up with

710
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:47,880
some bad rounding sometimes if you want

711
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,009
to keep the the scaling in use and then

712
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:55,770
some multiplication and division in that

713
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:57,900
case anyway next place right our yeah we

714
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,910
go and what was proposed on the thread

715
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,500
is multiplicative scaling which

716
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,210
basically says we just multiply number

717
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,370
rather than shifting it which

718
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:09,870
degenerates to a shift if you choose

719
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:11,279
certain values and arguably it's the

720
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,830
most complex but really we're not

721
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,170
talking about complexity here these are

722
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:19,350
no complex options and that's change

723
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:22,230
because of clarification yes I don't

724
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:26,339
think that divide is very quite for sin

725
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:28,170
because there yes now there's a good

726
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,680
point I should have made that point

727
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,540
already but as you say you can pick in

728
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,609
an exponent of 2 and then you can do it

729
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:40,320
as a as it shifted rather than a

730
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:42,180
divided and next next please the problem

731
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,860
with the multiplication is not that it's

732
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,859
more expensive it's at it's error-prone

733
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,360
acknowledge the error error point was

734
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,340
the points again emphasizing that this

735
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,280
is not very important I'm proposing here

736
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:03,510
that we invoke the alternative

737
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,800
decision-making process here and that is

738
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:08,020
documented in 39:29

739
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,450
the process would require us all

740
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:16,540
agreeing to adhere to that process and

741
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:22,000
then voting no matter what Dave Clark

742
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:25,540
says we do vote so can I ask the chairs

743
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,130
to run this and I'll sit down on the

744
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,390
floor because I don't think I've got

745
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:34,510
anything more so to be clear we are

746
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,830
choosing to the option a B and C they

747
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,830
seem to be the options we have some

748
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,480
interesting combinations of people with

749
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:45,460
different preference orders so a graphic

750
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,560
just oh one last point the discussion on

751
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,480
the issue made it very clear that we

752
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,970
wanted a negative vote so rather than

753
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:57,760
voting for a we would want to hear the

754
00:36:51,970 --> 00:37:00,160
people who hated a because that well you

755
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,630
know you can't live with a and we may

756
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,009
find that there's silence on all three

757
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,020
options in which case we might have to

758
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,640
find some other way so it seems like the

759
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,860
first question should be to see if

760
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,660
everyone agrees that there's not a

761
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,300
strong view and so that this is the

762
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,890
appropriate process to use Ted is

763
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,970
stepping back for the mic is it Nancy

764
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:20,109
author of those things okay do people

765
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,060
have thoughts that does anyone disagree

766
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,610
with that statement that they're they're

767
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,570
not strongly held views here and so we

768
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:31,630
just need to make a decision

769
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:34,750
Oh Martin Duke I'm now I'm gonna clear

770
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,850
about the procedure so if we slightly

771
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:39,790
prefer one are we not supposed to hum

772
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:43,930
because we can live with anything if you

773
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:45,400
slightly prefer one of them it depends

774
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,899
on how slight it is of course but if you

775
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:52,240
want to express that perfect preference

776
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:57,970
you would hum for the other two thank

777
00:37:52,240 --> 00:38:00,490
you that's ed hardy as author of RFC

778
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:03,069
3920 nine I would actually suggest one

779
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,950
of the other procedures in 39:29 for

780
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:08,410
this which is the pick somebody and make

781
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,319
them decide procedure the working group

782
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,230
can come to accept that instead of the

783
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,180
working group make the choice if you get

784
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,010
to that point you can simply pick

785
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,808
somebody by lot from the working group

786
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:25,549
and say they're going to decide

787
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:29,450
given if what Martin said was true that

788
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:36,049
there's pretty much equal selections

789
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:40,040
among the different potential choices

790
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:42,259
here then that one is far faster and I

791
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,599
suggest you do it rather than a vote so

792
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,829
that I think there's sort of it's rather

793
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,290
equal amongst the people who have

794
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:50,680
expressed an opinion on the issue no I

795
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:53,089
was gonna correct that okay right there

796
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,910
from my reading of this and this is just

797
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:58,160
my rating of this one of the options is

798
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:02,899
distinctly less preferred than the

799
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,899
others but that that may complicate its

800
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,730
suggestion although my reading is that

801
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,099
ie is much less preferred but there are

802
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,589
a few people who are advocating for that

803
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:14,750
Ted Hardy speaking again if if that's

804
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:16,308
the case then if you're selecting it by

805
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,809
random lot then there's a fair chance

806
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:20,359
that you'll get somebody who doesn't

807
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:22,309
like a because there are more of them

808
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,140
but there is always a chance that you

809
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:27,740
will end up with one of the people who

810
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:29,990
likes a as a result of that but the

811
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,569
whole thing and all of this is

812
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,879
predicated on the idea that everybody

813
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:37,308
can handle any of them that it's a

814
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,319
preference but we all agree that the

815
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:42,200
technical choices here all do the work

816
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:45,980
and it's it's just a question of whether

817
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,259
you can get to a decision that we all

818
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:51,380
agree we can all accept and so if you

819
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,530
want to do it with a vote sure but I the

820
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,940
other one would be faster although we're

821
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,230
spending time talking about how to make

822
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,670
the vote so I think we have to factor

823
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:03,650
that into does anyone disagree with the

824
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,349
statement that Ted just made that all

825
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:10,000
the options are technically viable and

826
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,000
that this is just a matter of preference

827
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:19,009
christian said no you need to get the

828
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,509
mic if you want to explain that we were

829
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,950
totally fine with whittling this down an

830
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,569
hour - right I mean we don't we don't

831
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:26,450
have to do it this way but but the

832
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:27,360
discussions are on the issue do I need a

833
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,649
beat

834
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,990
because there are announcement

835
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,700
requirements and other things in RC 3929

836
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:44,160
if you can just come to an agreement

837
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:48,710
here well the concern with option a is

838
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:53,129
that it will increase overhead and so I

839
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:54,990
don't know how much of a concern it is

840
00:40:53,130 --> 00:41:00,330
which is a concern that has driven us

841
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:02,370
all along this design and typically the

842
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:06,360
act delay could be something like a

843
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:08,609
quarter of the RTT so that means

844
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,600
increasing the overhead of packets by a

845
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,750
bite or two so I would like to have the

846
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:18,290
discussion occur ham is that do people

847
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:21,380
believe that it is not a very concerned

848
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,380
[Music]

849
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:28,860
all or the contrary because if people do

850
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:31,740
not believe it's a very concerned and

851
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:35,930
option a is just fine if they do believe

852
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,930
it is not and that's a binary decision

853
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:54,190
can I know on the quarry speak first so

854
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,110
gory forests are not very helpful

855
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,540
comment but I don't have any data on

856
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,770
this I do have higher RTT paths I do

857
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,009
care about overhead

858
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:07,350
has anybody measured it if we do a if we

859
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:07,350
don't do it now I will perfectly pump

860
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:14,110
so maybe the amendment that we need to

861
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:16,030
do is a first B and C and then if it

862
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:19,630
goes to B and C we decide between those

863
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:22,150
two would that be reasonable that seems

864
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:27,310
to have supporting the right okay and

865
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:29,110
rippln andrew McGregor parsley the issue

866
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,549
was this is that we're communicating a

867
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:35,380
whole lot of excess precision that is

868
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:38,200
useless right and so B I think is

869
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,670
preferred over this because it removes

870
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:46,689
the overhead and it means we're not

871
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:48,850
communicating useless excess data so

872
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,700
should we proceed in that fashion then

873
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:54,970
you go a versus B and C and then see how

874
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:58,569
we go from it yep so I think we'll just

875
00:42:54,970 --> 00:43:02,700
do a straight home who prefers a and

876
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:07,390
then who prefers B or C in other words

877
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:10,060
no scaling or some form of scaling are

878
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,910
we ready to make that decision or at

879
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:16,540
least gather that data

880
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:22,029
no we're not doing that this is a normal

881
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,500
everyday pedestrian ietf home such as it

882
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,080
is

883
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,090
so the first time again is if you prefer

884
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,490
the option a which is no scaling we

885
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:32,050
don't believe we need scaling the second

886
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,029
home will be you believe we need some

887
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,790
form of scaling without talking about

888
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:40,840
which particular form that will take is

889
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:47,140
that clear okay please come now if you

890
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:48,850
believe we do not need scaling please

891
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:53,670
hum now if you do not believe we need

892
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:55,828
scaling I hear

893
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,900
but one might interpret as one person

894
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:59,690
humming if we weren't trying to dia

895
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,010
naanum eyes that data

896
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:07,650
please hum now if you believe we need

897
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:11,369
some form of scaling that seems like an

898
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:13,980
extremely clear result for the record

899
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:16,770
there is a strong sense of the room that

900
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,599
we need some form of scaling Martin can

901
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:21,000
I request that when you phrase the next

902
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:31,619
hum you put the word now at the end and

903
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:32,220
not at the beginning thank you what you

904
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,990
said

905
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,470
please hum now if bla bla bla bla bla

906
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:44,009
bla okay

907
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:47,578
invert the pedantry noted so are we

908
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:50,549
ready to decide between option B and

909
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:55,170
option C do we believe we have all the

910
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:58,170
information available I'm going to ask

911
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,809
again two questions I will ask you to

912
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,000
hum for option B exponential and then

913
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:05,040
I'll ask you to hum for option C

914
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,710
multiplicative you can hum for both if

915
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,020
you have no preference or you have some

916
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:15,329
other state where you believe that both

917
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:20,359
are okay so please hum if you believe we

918
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:20,359
should do exponential scaling now

919
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,360
okay thank you and please come if you

920
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,370
believe we should do milk with

921
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:33,690
multiplicative scaling now someone's

922
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:42,569
trying to override the pudding over

923
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:44,610
there I I would the the person was very

924
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:50,910
very slightly outer but it's by no means

925
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:53,730
clear um we have working group members

926
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:56,640
who are suggesting we use the process of

927
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:00,120
coin flipping pioneered in the HTTP

928
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,129
working group that requires the working

929
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,350
group as a whole to buy into the fact or

930
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,210
to the notion that it's more important

931
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:12,299
to make progress than it is to get what

932
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:13,710
you want I here well give me the coin

933
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:22,860
just in case because I'm always willing

934
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:25,500
except money in spent go go time

935
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,240
I just want to comment that one of them

936
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,000
is currently in the draft and in all the

937
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,009
implementations and the other one isn't

938
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:44,250
like can we just do nothing and move

939
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:47,370
with this but that's a pretty good point

940
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:49,140
why are you not sure yet Ian yeah no no

941
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,880
he should be ad that's next level I

942
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,980
really messaging people offline to be

943
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,810
like can we just not do anything so I

944
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:59,430
rise to support Ian on this like okay if

945
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,830
that's an argument video using we can

946
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:04,549
use that for a lot of issues I don't

947
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:06,720
think that's a tenable argument though

948
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:08,940
there are people who are interesting one

949
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,089
to change the code to be multiplicative

950
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,720
it's one operation it's not a lot of

951
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,720
change to good

952
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,819
Martin Duke I agree with the in an actor

953
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,410
just because I don't think it is a big

954
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,050
deal I don't think anyone's gonna be

955
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:27,330
dramatically affected and just reducing

956
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,070
churn change and PRS and consensus costs

957
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:31,529
at this point is quite valuable and my

958
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:34,050
preference for B is not at all technical

959
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,110
is slowly to not

960
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:40,140
unnecessarily shift the standard for

961
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:42,360
non-critical reasons so it sounds like

962
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,609
the proposal which has a non-trivial

963
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,670
amount of support is to close this issue

964
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:55,860
with no action because it's already in

965
00:47:47,670 --> 00:48:01,080
the spec do we have anybody who believes

966
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:05,210
that we shouldn't do so and it already

967
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,210
hasn't been discussed we just move on I

968
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,240
don't want to make the technical point

969
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:17,190
but there is a difference between the

970
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:19,169
two mechanisms with a shift you do it's

971
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,270
natural to go from microseconds to

972
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:25,410
milliseconds by dividing or multiplying

973
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:27,810
by 1,000 it's not a thousand 24 I know

974
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:31,140
it's a simple and silly perhaps a minor

975
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:33,090
point but milliseconds to microseconds

976
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:39,509
as a multiplication by thousand not a

977
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:41,850
shift by ten I mean it just is simply

978
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:44,430
what it happens if you want approximated

979
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:48,210
to be thousand 24 that's the discussion

980
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:52,020
you want to have that I caused the whole

981
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:56,370
passage I I completely agree with

982
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:59,940
but now on the other hand people who

983
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:04,890
want precision can always use a scaling

984
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:08,240
of one and that good if they effectively

985
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:12,480
forced them to go back to option a and

986
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:15,270
so maybe we can ask to people preferring

987
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:22,610
option see if they can live is using

988
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:22,610
scaling one and then Excel we can live

989
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:43,129
Machinery Tama really

990
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:47,950
if the problem is conduction from

991
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:50,960
microseconds to milliseconds or having a

992
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:54,348
multiply you can deduce your multiply

993
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,680
from the sheet value that's that's not

994
00:49:54,349 --> 00:50:00,319
an issue Minh I I am I am already

995
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,480
wondering why people are so concerned

996
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,849
about that optimize your dumb

997
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,640
multiplication that's all come on

998
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:09,829
we have modern CPUs are pipelining many

999
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,990
implementation you're not getting into

1000
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:16,130
CPU stole their I have a hard time

1001
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,930
believing that it has any effect

1002
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,260
whatsoever on the grant Bachmann's of

1003
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,259
the same

1004
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,600
so from a design perspective why would

1005
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,299
he is a shift you would use a shift to

1006
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,190
save bytes because shift is smaller than

1007
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,130
a multiplier but this is a value that

1008
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:39,320
send once in the transport parameter so

1009
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:46,460
we don't really have to pay anything for

1010
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:49,310
making it a modifier now in order to

1011
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,560
unpack the pack frames you need a pack

1012
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,360
apply this value that's negotiated with

1013
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:58,520
a parameter to the value in the egg

1014
00:50:53,360 --> 00:51:01,190
frame puts for every a crate gave its

1015
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,950
Ganassi Google question about process

1016
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:07,640
this is a change to the transport dock

1017
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:10,399
and the transport dock is under the late

1018
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,930
stage process my understanding of that

1019
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,480
process and please correct me if I'm

1020
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:17,000
wrong was that if something doesn't have

1021
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,410
working with consensus then we close it

1022
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
with no action and move on with our

1023
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,009
lives

1024
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,410
if clearly this doesn't have consensus

1025
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:27,410
why are we still going around in circles

1026
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:30,730
that's part of the adoption process for

1027
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:32,690
adopting new issues or considering

1028
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:36,100
census process and how would close

1029
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,100
issues thank you

1030
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:42,980
so it appears that we wouldn't be able

1031
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,870
to do a coin flip for example now

1032
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,680
because it seems people do still have

1033
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,940
some strong feelings having said that it

1034
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,359
seems like a large part of the working

1035
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,890
group does want to just move on my

1036
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,630
suggestion would be to discus there was

1037
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,879
some discussion after the hum

1038
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:02,210
specifically Ian made his comment and I

1039
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,860
would rerun the hum one more time to see

1040
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,610
if anybody's mind has changed and if

1041
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,050
we're still split right worried about it

1042
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,900
then it was also because it was a

1043
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:14,030
certian Roberto and and Martin I would

1044
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,270
rather have any result than have to talk

1045
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:18,770
about this more but just in case we

1046
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,500
actually have to have one I'm going to

1047
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:23,600
point out that an option see if you

1048
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:28,250
choose zero you're going to have some

1049
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:34,540
problems and an option B if you choose

1050
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:36,860
zero nothing happens and it just works

1051
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,840
okay I'd like to do another hums let's

1052
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,470
drain the queues quickly well I've now

1053
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,380
invented all

1054
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:45,430
C prime which is it's C except it's the

1055
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:48,260
multiplier of minus 1

1056
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:48,640
I'd like helpful discussion at the mics

1057
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,980
please

1058
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:58,250
Navaro let's let's do another hum a

1059
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:04,520
normal everyday ITF vanilla option B

1060
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:12,619
versus option C if you prefer option B

1061
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:18,079
please hum now if you prefer option C

1062
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:21,310
please hum now that seems like clear

1063
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,310
support for option B to me

1064
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:33,870
but did I just hear from people that

1065
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,180
they were unwilling to change their

1066
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,350
implementations I couldn't hear that did

1067
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,460
I just hear from people that they're

1068
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:42,089
unwilling to change their

1069
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:44,130
implementations that is one that's

1070
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,750
really good intuitive that from that's

1071
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:51,710
what I'm interpreting from this one

1072
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:54,180
that's an interesting sign I have to say

1073
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:57,360
because that's what turned that one yeah

1074
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,339
if I'm reading that and to be clear we

1075
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:02,640
don't make a decision based just on hums

1076
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,870
if people have technical arguments that

1077
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,060
they think will change people's minds

1078
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,170
please bring them now it's off or we're

1079
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,700
not hearing this we're not hearing the

1080
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,970
minds change we're hearing the mines

1081
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,589
pretty much focusing on option B let's

1082
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,330
drain the keys relatively quickly Eckerd

1083
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,530
sure I mean Martin that wasn't my

1084
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:18,900
primary motivation my prayer meditation

1085
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:21,000
was we have something in the spec like

1086
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,090
if it's fine then like I don't want to

1087
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,060
like go over it again again I don't

1088
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,980
think it's big for these for us like as

1089
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,370
Ian said it for C I probably be if you

1090
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:36,680
see we're in this back I'd like fine

1091
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:38,009
Martin dude okay Eric let's take it home

1092
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:42,240
Wow

1093
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:53,070
okay all right let's move on then how do

1094
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:57,270
okay right record that thank you oh this

1095
00:54:53,070 --> 00:55:02,180
groans another direction okay 28:44

1096
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:02,180
david's bananas in these Walker's Jervis

1097
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:15,520
dear it's glossy and cool so this issue

1098
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,410
came up from discussions on some other

1099
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,500
issues where basically we realized that

1100
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:22,149
as currently defined in the document the

1101
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,410
client connection ideas don't actually

1102
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,980
accomplish what they're trying to

1103
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:28,839
accomplish so in quick the goal of the

1104
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,000
connection ID is when you receive a

1105
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:34,240
packet it allows you to identify which

1106
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,890
connection is back in Napster and there

1107
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,868
are cases where you don't need those

1108
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,299
let's say as a client if you have one

1109
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,650
newbie port connection you don't need to

1110
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,210
multiplex they all go to the same

1111
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:45,369
connections you can use your length

1112
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,200
connection ideas that was kind of the

1113
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:48,940
rationale behind them in the first place

1114
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,730
and how I I personally have been rude

1115
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:54,340
reasoning about them except in the

1116
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:57,190
current document it says that the server

1117
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:00,490
can decide to use zero length connection

1118
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:02,470
ID even when it cannot multiplex and

1119
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:05,020
then that has a whole bunch of

1120
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:06,790
repercussions such as oh when you do

1121
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:09,580
that the clients no longer allowed to

1122
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:13,150
migrate or if there's a not rebinding

1123
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:16,630
everything crash and burns and so what

1124
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:19,180
I'm proposing I have a PR for this is to

1125
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:21,369
say look you can use your like

1126
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:23,830
connection IDs if you can do multiplex

1127
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:25,810
without connection IDs it's pretty

1128
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:28,920
simple a connection ID is something that

1129
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:32,500
is only in the direction towards you and

1130
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,990
that's how you you use them that makes

1131
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,970
the spec a bunch simpler removes a bunch

1132
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,220
of text stuff that was disallowed and I

1133
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:41,020
don't think the one use case of a server

1134
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,399
who wants to use you like the knish

1135
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:48,220
attendees and multiplexing is are very

1136
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:50,380
useful use case so I'm not in Thompson I

1137
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:52,540
just label this proposal ready we've had

1138
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:55,960
a bunch of discussion on this one it

1139
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:58,810
still didn't slip the net I think David

1140
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,390
solution is is correct using information

1141
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:05,020
that you control to ensure the packets

1142
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:09,700
are routed to you is very good using

1143
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:12,009
source address based routing doesn't

1144
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,660
work uniformly in this protocol because

1145
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:18,130
of the risk of gray bindings and

1146
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:20,500
vibrations if that's the case we can put

1147
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:21,670
this through our normal process see if

1148
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,060
we can do with consensus calling the

1149
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,160
list

1150
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,410
of people feel that there are problems

1151
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,910
with this proposal that would benefit

1152
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,009
from discuss in this room let's do that

1153
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,049
now otherwise we'll just do but

1154
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:34,210
consensus comma list

1155
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:37,180
you got a am i it just seemed that

1156
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:39,550
this proposal excludes the case of two

1157
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:43,029
machines that know that they're not the

1158
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:48,630
kindness of any kind just not using

1159
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:53,050
connection edges so this requires that

1160
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:56,500
server does not use source connection

1161
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:58,450
source IP information from the packets

1162
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,550
seems unnecessary

1163
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:05,740
if the server know that the source is

1164
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:08,380
not behind net so you're in this context

1165
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,910
does is there multiple clients talking

1166
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:14,080
to that same server on the same port

1167
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:16,720
yeah and guess yeah yeah imagine many

1168
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,240
machines belonging to I know Google

1169
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,980
whatever Akamai that I'm not behind that

1170
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,770
they just want to make a point-to-point

1171
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:28,870
connection to each other they use the

1172
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:32,740
same port but they unit they use the

1173
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:34,540
same destination port so that breaks

1174
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,310
connection migration yeah

1175
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:38,680
they not gonna make right they're like

1176
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:43,060
stationary their actual server hardware

1177
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:45,160
they're not mobile I honestly think that

1178
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:47,860
that's a bunch of complexity for a use

1179
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,240
case that were like never at least a who

1180
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,000
are never going to use like the

1181
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,439
connection IDs are not a big overhead

1182
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,630
there's another big overhead either you

1183
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,920
just say talk always use connection lead

1184
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,740
you just forget about it

1185
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:07,210
but why making it make a statement must

1186
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:08,979
not use source of the packets because it

1187
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:14,359
breaks these features that we think are

1188
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:17,849
important to the product occur

1189
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:19,319
yeah yeah I apologize I'm noticing this

1190
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:22,709
earlier when it was being floated around

1191
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:24,689
a lot of messages going around on I mean

1192
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:25,948
this is a pretty substantial deviation

1193
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:29,058
from what we previously agreed upon

1194
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:31,199
which was it was reasonable to build a

1195
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:33,059
server which had effectively the same

1196
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,890
like connection semantics of TCP which

1197
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:37,140
is to say that you use the five to 450

1198
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:38,249
bucks and you didn't care about if you

1199
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,529
didn't care about like having that

1200
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:41,819
rebinding work properly and this seems

1201
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:43,109
like a previous example shows that and

1202
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:47,969
like that's like a privilege and nothing

1203
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:50,910
to want to do and I understand David's

1204
00:59:47,969 --> 00:59:53,459
understand David's point here but I

1205
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:54,779
point out that the primary use case Dave

1206
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:56,368
is interested in is not something we're

1207
00:59:54,779 --> 00:59:58,109
charging to do and the thing that like

1208
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:02,279
is emulating basic HTTP servers is

1209
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:05,279
something we're told you to do and what

1210
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:07,829
I just said the primary thing that um

1211
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:10,319
that the peer-to-peer use cases are not

1212
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:12,529
something which harder to do can I

1213
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,529
finish

1214
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,319
we are not chartered require connection

1215
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:23,819
migration which are to a wild connection

1216
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,959
migration weenus plus a decision that

1217
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:28,319
you could just opt out a connection

1218
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:29,640
migration if I wanted to and so on while

1219
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,650
I think it's certainly valuable to be

1220
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,509
able to indicate to the peer that you'd

1221
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,759
like them not to use it on their like

1222
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:37,890
them not see it do you let them have a

1223
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:40,049
nonzero life connection ID like let's

1224
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:41,279
say you do an extension and card tuning

1225
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:43,349
of the protocol here and a must

1226
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:45,929
seems like I'm walking by something we

1227
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:47,969
previously agreed to do so I maybe have

1228
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:48,929
some reason to do but it's like I mean

1229
01:00:47,969 --> 01:00:53,219
there's more discussion that we're

1230
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:57,959
seeing now can I try to clarify this one

1231
01:00:53,219 --> 01:01:06,499
maybe I can help so in order to do what

1232
01:00:57,959 --> 01:01:10,019
theyõre is suggesting here we have a 4b

1233
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:12,569
the in order for someone to decide that

1234
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:15,209
it's possible that they can use some

1235
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:17,549
aspect of the source address to

1236
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:20,788
determine which connection the packet

1237
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:22,739
belongs to they have to be certain that

1238
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:25,109
every single client that they were ever

1239
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:26,770
talk to is not going to be subject to

1240
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:28,750
migration

1241
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:32,830
is not gonna be subject it's an

1242
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:37,000
rebinding you don't agree with that that

1243
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:41,740
that I think was it was my point but if

1244
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,450
if that's wrong I'd like to hear why yes

1245
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,250
well I was gonna say that

1246
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:47,049
in terms of the TCP analogy it seems

1247
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,970
like this restriction is fairly

1248
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:51,010
analogous to typically how TCP is used

1249
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:53,730
where a client opens an ephemeral port

1250
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:55,720
and hence the local authority an IP

1251
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:58,840
allowed to identify it like the

1252
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:03,339
connection so it seems kind of in line

1253
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:04,630
but how I don't know just remind folks

1254
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,600
to please stick into the microphone

1255
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:11,500
directly the acoustics near horrible

1256
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:13,740
Tommy Polly Apple so I was just thinking

1257
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,240
maybe one solution we could do to modify

1258
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:19,629
the existing pull request for this to

1259
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:22,509
take into account kickers thoughts on

1260
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:26,619
this is to specify that the server can

1261
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:29,080
have zero length connection IDs for

1262
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:31,390
itself if it in its transport parameters

1263
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,090
also disables migration right so we can

1264
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:35,319
just say that if you want to do this

1265
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:39,070
explicitly disable migration to not

1266
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:40,930
allow it and that way you for this point

1267
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:43,359
to point to server use case that's

1268
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:44,740
totally fine and it essentially

1269
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,119
generalizes this to not be a

1270
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,799
client-server thing but just explains

1271
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:54,520
here are the trade-offs of what you have

1272
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:57,190
to do Erik Kinnear Apple just a brief

1273
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,990
note on there I think disabled migration

1274
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,160
is becoming disabled active migration

1275
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:03,129
because it has nothing to do with Nats

1276
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:07,089
and so I think those things are

1277
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:10,180
orthogonal so if you have if you really

1278
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:11,920
wanted to do this allow the zero length

1279
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:17,529
connection ID and remove the transport

1280
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:19,119
parameter entirely so I think there were

1281
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:20,290
scroll again I think Ian said is

1282
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,970
actually what I was trying to get at

1283
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,340
which is like the way the like your

1284
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:25,959
standard like TCP server works now is

1285
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,700
the client picks on a ephemeral port and

1286
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,619
the server has a static port and the

1287
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,509
server so reasons the 5-tuple deserves

1288
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:34,359
distinguish clients and finds phi2

1289
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:36,490
clients clients ports or dress changes

1290
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:39,670
then tcp is hosed and like things fault

1291
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:43,209
line and so on

1292
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:45,520
uh is great the quick allows you to has

1293
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:48,670
mekin allow you to survive yeah um but

1294
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,900
it is not mandatory but my point is like

1295
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:51,040
it's probably reasonable to say I don't

1296
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,320
carry any this mechanism I just wanna

1297
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,270
say that he's more or less a tcp and in

1298
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,740
those cases like why should be able to

1299
01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:00,880
bear the overhead of any connection ID

1300
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:02,319
so I certainly understand on now David's

1301
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,310
point which I agree with is that if you

1302
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,840
want to make a peer-to-peer protocol

1303
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,430
everybody uses the exact same ports all

1304
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,910
the time then journey that should I use

1305
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,980
the D MUX

1306
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,299
um that's actually I'm a little

1307
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:12,100
surprised rash I having that problem but

1308
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,660
I'm prepared to cleave if you do um but

1309
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,589
it seems like that seems like if

1310
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,359
straightforward way to do that is have

1311
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:18,070
an extension that says like no listen

1312
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,380
you can't even answer a connection ID

1313
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:22,120
I'm also I'm a little surprised and it

1314
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,670
seems like that I'm not quite sure I

1315
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,380
understand what your design is that you

1316
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:27,400
wouldn't know a priori that was not

1317
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,110
saying you should do but maybe that's

1318
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,460
different but it seems like this is a

1319
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:32,290
client meeting we can easily negotiate

1320
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,820
whatever flag it happened to be so I'm

1321
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:36,370
sort of pollinate the feature out at a

1322
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:40,720
must level here um whether you know she

1323
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:42,430
ate the converse my burning crema I

1324
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,200
think I'm here to say what ekor said but

1325
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:48,850
I trailed off at the end the acoustics

1326
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:50,859
in here really suck the the TCP

1327
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:53,470
semantics do you have the downside that

1328
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:55,030
things get screwed up um the world has

1329
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:57,370
lived for the past thirty years those

1330
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:59,980
semantics and the past 28 years if not

1331
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:02,380
or however long that's been going on I

1332
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,980
mean so these are risks that pretty much

1333
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,420
everybody

1334
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,260
there's connectivity risk in the

1335
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:10,390
internet yeah great we know that um I

1336
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:12,070
would essentially support a slight

1337
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:13,900
change to this PR that essentially just

1338
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:14,530
notes that hey if you want to use TCP

1339
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:27,190
semantics

1340
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:29,950
great you get TCP guarantees and yeah so

1341
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:32,380
it doesn't matter if we have

1342
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:34,629
functionality that tries to get us

1343
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,460
around the NAT because invariably

1344
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:38,680
somebody is not going to support all the

1345
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,990
features that actually make that work

1346
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,640
which means that the application stacks

1347
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:44,140
are always going to have to have their

1348
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,270
timeouts and their reconnects the

1349
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,379
timeout and the reconnect is ultimately

1350
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,450
the only way you're going to get

1351
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,560
reliability in a vast number of

1352
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,609
scenarios anyway

1353
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,590
it's gonna have to be there

1354
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:56,540
why are we talking about this why isn't

1355
01:05:54,590 --> 01:06:00,550
there just editorial saying that look

1356
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:00,550
you're gonna have to do this sometimes

1357
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:09,259
give its Ganassi so the the problem here

1358
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:13,340
is the the reason we have client

1359
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:15,470
connection IDs is so quick clients can

1360
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:18,770
multiplex just the same way that servers

1361
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:21,640
do but as a client I can run a bunch of

1362
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:26,210
connections from the same source port

1363
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:28,339
otherwise you don't need them and most

1364
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:30,860
like browsers today we'll use ephemeral

1365
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:32,210
ports use them as your langston like

1366
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:33,680
that's why the Google quick encoding

1367
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:36,080
didn't have those but we added those

1368
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:39,020
time connection ID stage Jeff quick to

1369
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:42,410
allow this use case in the current spec

1370
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:45,620
that doesn't work because if as a client

1371
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:48,049
I want to create a connection I don't

1372
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:50,569
yet know if the server is using these

1373
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:53,060
TCP semantics and then everything falls

1374
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,620
over if I put multiple connections on my

1375
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:57,170
same local port and the service using

1376
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:59,420
the 5-tuple so if we don't want client

1377
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:02,960
connection IDs to work then let's just

1378
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:04,610
remove them from this back we're

1379
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,790
thinking about closing the queue soon by

1380
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:10,250
the way Martin sometimes and I I think

1381
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:15,529
Becca's point there is a really good one

1382
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:17,150
and mostly convincing for me I'd be I

1383
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:19,250
think I'd be almost okay with the idea

1384
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:21,820
of what Brian said if you want these

1385
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:24,470
aviso Mattox you get sick tcp guarantees

1386
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:26,000
the only reservation I have and I'd like

1387
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:30,740
people to think about this a little bit

1388
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,260
is that this is a unilateral decision in

1389
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:35,149
a two-party protocol and whether or not

1390
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:38,360
we need to have some sort of negotiation

1391
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:41,600
for that property or not I just

1392
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:43,700
interject there you said you there in my

1393
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,990
mind I'm wondering if you know this is a

1394
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:48,500
decision that can be made by the

1395
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:49,209
application being mapped onto quick does

1396
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:54,250
that help

1397
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:56,240
that might yes but not necessarily I

1398
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:59,210
suspect that this is going to be one of

1399
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,890
those cases where you have as as igor is

1400
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:03,380
described as over the server scenario

1401
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:05,100
where it makes them absolute sense to

1402
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,940
have this

1403
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:10,440
for HTTP right it will I see HTTP where

1404
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:13,170
I put this in my browser I would rather

1405
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,540
not have the server unilaterally make

1406
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:19,170
this decision for me because I know that

1407
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:20,910
I am mobile and this is the this is the

1408
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:24,540
bit where I have some reservations about

1409
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:30,660
simply saying TCP cement extensive

1410
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:35,460
eternities pro vector so i'll say again

1411
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:36,689
that we as a protocol as as a group of

1412
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,819
people making a protocol what we are

1413
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:41,879
doing is providing potential

1414
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:44,729
functionality to endpoints and these

1415
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,770
endpoints can decide to not use this

1416
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:50,279
functionality regardless of what we spec

1417
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:52,710
in particular even if we have con ID it

1418
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,300
can be ignored by the server it I mean

1419
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:57,600
con ideas their core routing for the

1420
01:08:54,300 --> 01:09:01,230
server in this particular direction so

1421
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,700
having this does not guarantee that we

1422
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:06,179
get anything better than TCP like

1423
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:08,460
functionality regardless I will also

1424
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:12,390
state that servers who are silly enough

1425
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:15,630
to do this globally are going to see

1426
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:17,970
much worse outcomes than servers that

1427
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:19,800
actually put the con ID on here if we're

1428
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:22,140
worried about performance this will fix

1429
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,730
itself I don't think we need to talk

1430
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:26,070
about this deeply because it's gonna fix

1431
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:27,569
itself regardless so Roberta would your

1432
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:34,049
proposal be to close this issue with no

1433
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:36,809
action ego yeah basically similar to

1434
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:40,109
Roberta said if a server have clients

1435
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:41,820
that Wando mcGirk migrate and it has

1436
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:44,820
zero connection it is just a broken

1437
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:48,330
server but not all servers are designed

1438
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:51,299
to serve mobile clients some servers are

1439
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:53,069
designed to serve stationary client that

1440
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,680
they know that they really know about

1441
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:57,719
and they know what their properties are

1442
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,270
and those who define the result should

1443
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:04,610
not be penalized by requiring to have

1444
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:04,610
this connection ID that they don't need

1445
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:16,530
at all firstly I'd like to add my plus

1446
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:19,020
one what David says if we keep honestly

1447
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:23,400
make this change it is really

1448
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:26,580
to have one implementation that does

1449
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:29,219
both client and server because the

1450
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:31,019
requirements on how the sockets are

1451
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:32,820
being mapped the connections becomes

1452
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:35,300
different on the client and the server

1453
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,299
side

1454
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:44,700
Tommy Polly Apple one other proposal for

1455
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:47,340
how we could deal with this given the

1456
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:49,950
current conversation is to kind of take

1457
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,960
this PRM maybe move it out of the

1458
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:53,730
transport to allow the transport to kind

1459
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,190
of be open to allow any use of

1460
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:57,570
connection IDs and put this into the

1461
01:10:55,190 --> 01:11:00,509
like manageability document

1462
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:02,700
I'm sorry applicability document to give

1463
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:08,219
guidance about how to deploy it now

1464
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:10,830
that's fine as hmm those are not

1465
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:12,390
standing spec documents does guidance on

1466
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:23,070
this for how to deploy me to be

1467
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:26,790
standards track reference gauzy I think

1468
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:31,320
what it boils down Martin described it

1469
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:34,080
really well is that it is a property of

1470
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:36,900
the server to want to use old TCP

1471
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:41,550
semantics or new quick connection ID

1472
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:45,599
semantics and if we allow it to

1473
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:48,420
unilaterally make that decision then we

1474
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,610
end up having to negotiate this the

1475
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,620
problem is this is something that's a

1476
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:55,080
client you need to decide before you

1477
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,580
start your connection and so you can't

1478
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,350
negotiate something when you haven't

1479
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,450
talked to the other side before and

1480
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:06,840
that's why like this breaks down pretty

1481
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:11,099
quickly Andrew were you and cute yes I

1482
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:13,380
think the proposed change is a strict

1483
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:17,280
improvement over the routing in red with

1484
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:19,110
a one word death on top which is an in

1485
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,690
point should not use a zero in

1486
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:24,330
connection my deal is in other words

1487
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:28,250
this is a clearer explanation of what

1488
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:31,080
this means and it expresses a preference

1489
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:32,880
but if you don't make it a must

1490
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,780
requirement then it

1491
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,030
she's the same thing as the other

1492
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:39,179
wording in let everybody know what the

1493
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:43,409
consequences are I'm interested to see

1494
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:45,210
what David thinks about that so Martin

1495
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:47,699
Thompson while Dave is going up there I

1496
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:50,510
think that is a good improvement

1497
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:53,759
I don't think it covers the unilateral

1498
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:55,350
decision making process because the

1499
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,090
problem here is that we have one

1500
01:12:55,350 --> 01:13:01,800
endpoint can make a unilateral decision

1501
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:03,210
that affects the other endpoint now

1502
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,300
looking the side that we're comfortable

1503
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:11,489
with that but I don't think it addresses

1504
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:13,860
that concern so but the peer does

1505
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:18,089
multiple things one of them is this must

1506
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:20,339
that Andrew suggests reach or should

1507
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:22,770
another thing is that because we have

1508
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:26,850
this must it allows us to remove a bunch

1509
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:29,790
of text I think further down going yeah

1510
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:32,040
that a little bit that says oh if you

1511
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:33,239
receive the signal which is the server's

1512
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:38,909
using this you're like connection ID

1513
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:41,459
disabled these features and the problem

1514
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:44,400
is if we turn the mast up there to

1515
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:48,060
assured then you end up leaving the

1516
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:49,830
clients guessing and maybe we're okay

1517
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,780
with that with saying like hey we

1518
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:54,239
document this as a server if you do this

1519
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:58,139
you won't work with some clients but

1520
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:59,879
that has drop risks if some servers

1521
01:13:58,139 --> 01:14:01,949
decide to do it and some clients decide

1522
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:06,060
to multiplex on the one socket then

1523
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:07,650
things fall over anchor and then I think

1524
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,810
we're gonna try and find a way to move

1525
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,949
on and I think it's important to

1526
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,659
recognize we're actually talking about

1527
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:17,519
two features which are sort of coupled

1528
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:21,269
one feature is sustaining migration

1529
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:23,370
error side and one feature it on this

1530
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:25,949
one one feature is having multiple

1531
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:27,269
connections on the same host port pair

1532
01:14:25,949 --> 01:14:29,250
on the air side I mean there is having

1533
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:31,980
one connection on tubular sports

1534
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:33,420
proposed no side and those beans are

1535
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,949
being like operative of the same feature

1536
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:36,030
but they're like very different for like

1537
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:39,690
the server's perspective and they're

1538
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:43,500
very different from the input to the

1539
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:46,199
design in system so um I guess I'm

1540
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,739
trying to understand it's it it's

1541
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,989
basically

1542
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:51,239
research in TCP that you can't survive

1543
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:52,888
like that you can't have two clients

1544
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,869
with the same like this important

1545
01:14:52,889 --> 01:15:01,099
parameter sighs um like if you're the

1546
01:14:54,869 --> 01:15:06,570
server um it just right and um and so I

1547
01:15:01,099 --> 01:15:08,840
think the question the question that the

1548
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:13,170
way to turn around like Martin's

1549
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:16,170
question is like should we require all

1550
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:18,210
quick servers regards of an application

1551
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:20,070
Iran to support the more rich semantics

1552
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:22,440
of how Iong the scene whose portrait on

1553
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:23,699
their side or should we allow them to

1554
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,299
can you operate it's easy peasy metrics

1555
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:28,739
hum and um I guess the thing I think

1556
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:32,099
basically I think that's probably worth

1557
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:35,369
on got emprender to COAS like Roberto's

1558
01:15:32,099 --> 01:15:36,420
comments and David's comments is like is

1559
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,009
this really something which has to be

1560
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,989
done to quickscope versus again telling

1561
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:42,090
which in an application scope and are

1562
01:15:39,989 --> 01:15:43,860
there in particular like does the HTTP

1563
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:45,570
using application we were charted for we

1564
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,710
need that or that isn't nearly another

1565
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,808
application which is coming out later

1566
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:53,639
which then we can layer a new semantics

1567
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:56,550
on yeah so Martin tell some Roberto

1568
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:59,960
convinced me off mic that the changed

1569
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:03,150
that Andrew proposed was sufficient I'm

1570
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:08,610
I think that we should take the P R with

1571
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:12,799
the must changed what should because you

1572
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:12,799
have you have servers out there that can

1573
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:19,320
to echos point there you have and it's

1574
01:16:17,909 --> 01:16:20,999
not application so much as it is

1575
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,619
deployments but you have deployments in

1576
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:26,309
which you can make this decision for

1577
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:30,079
yourself and I think that's perfectly

1578
01:16:26,309 --> 01:16:33,749
acceptable now the conversational hand

1579
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,210
so I I don't think we should put this at

1580
01:16:33,749 --> 01:16:39,329
the application layer because all of the

1581
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:41,989
concepts that this impacts are at the

1582
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:45,808
transport layer action IDs migration and

1583
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:48,178
also like Martin was saying this is a

1584
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:51,599
property of your deployment like is your

1585
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:54,480
client sharing a port like my HTTP

1586
01:16:51,599 --> 01:16:56,369
browser can share a port it's not a

1587
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,070
property of the fact that we're running

1588
01:16:56,369 --> 01:17:02,239
HTTP or something else

1589
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:05,329
that that said moving this to a shirt

1590
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:07,489
and maybe adding some text on I can add

1591
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:09,170
like a sentence on here's what will

1592
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:11,989
break if you violate it should and you

1593
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:14,690
can do it if you know that it's your

1594
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:17,269
network there no Nats Jana then you can

1595
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:23,089
do this but that I would be personally

1596
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:25,940
okay with kutzle help lastly my

1597
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:28,070
preference also goes to having something

1598
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:30,739
stronger than should maybe something

1599
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:38,659
something like must unless you know that

1600
01:17:30,739 --> 01:17:41,780
that is it miss Maddocks works is not

1601
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:45,769
interfere closes as well um um I guess

1602
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:47,599
I'd be comfortable like with the should

1603
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:49,250
piece of the part that Andrew pointed

1604
01:17:47,599 --> 01:17:50,960
out the rest it because I think

1605
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:52,219
certainly encouraging people not to like

1606
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,760
well I anticipate semantics is a fine

1607
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:56,929
plan if it turns out that like people

1608
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,480
everyone wants to do that we can pull

1609
01:17:56,929 --> 01:18:00,829
that off later um but I'm less

1610
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:04,159
certain about the other pieces we think

1611
01:18:00,829 --> 01:18:06,380
we'll have to not go away um er um but

1612
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:08,059
we can less study that problem I'm I

1613
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:11,270
think I'm less comfortable with this

1614
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:12,380
sort of should unless you like know that

1615
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,579
the America doesn't have mats with those

1616
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,349
kinds of things personally process the

1617
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:16,730
point is that like the applicate that

1618
01:18:15,349 --> 01:18:19,520
the server's want to tolerate those

1619
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:20,718
behaviors um so like I think it's fine

1620
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,070
to say like here that here the shitty

1621
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,199
consequences that will happen if like

1622
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:25,429
you you know if you don't do this like

1623
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,860
I'm happy to have that be like arbitrary

1624
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:29,090
long and scary but on the point of

1625
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,159
having normative Texas says like you

1626
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:33,050
can't do it unless you um you know and

1627
01:18:31,159 --> 01:18:33,920
so cuz it was also fine words like don't

1628
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:36,380
do this since we're taller the

1629
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,849
consequences but the saying don't do it

1630
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,460
less those consequences don't apply it

1631
01:18:37,849 --> 01:18:43,699
okay let's see if we can drain the cues

1632
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:47,210
quickly a lot for this I'm not sure I'm

1633
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:48,678
understanding close the bike place I'm

1634
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:50,270
not sure if I'm understanding the issue

1635
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:52,550
here correctly let's assume I have a

1636
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,230
client that always uses the same the

1637
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:56,989
same part to make new connections and

1638
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:59,269
wants to use connection IDs to

1639
01:18:56,989 --> 01:19:01,909
demultiplex and now the client wants to

1640
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:07,060
establish two connections to to the same

1641
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:07,059
server then this will just break right

1642
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:16,909
well so that's what this PR is saying is

1643
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:20,449
that if the server accepts multiple

1644
01:19:16,909 --> 01:19:22,638
connection also of the same port it must

1645
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:25,039
like use locally could actually ID or

1646
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:27,079
should now use connection IDs because

1647
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:28,309
otherwise it will break so that's the

1648
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:31,880
failure mode that we're trying to solve

1649
01:19:28,309 --> 01:19:33,829
just to clarify there the the the end

1650
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,980
point that chooses not to use a

1651
01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:39,558
connection ID but that chooses not to

1652
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:42,558
use a connection ID has to use address

1653
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:45,050
and port to disambiguate what's the

1654
01:19:42,559 --> 01:19:47,090
nature of them but it's it's only

1655
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:49,630
information that its users not be not

1656
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,630
the remote sites

1657
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:06,060
so so we should make it a must because

1658
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:09,330
this is a Kinect this is a decision that

1659
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:11,070
the rubber makes and the client has no

1660
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:14,010
way of knowing like let's assume the

1661
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:15,870
client once really wants to connect - to

1662
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:20,250
connections because the server's serving

1663
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:22,200
two domains so it it has to know if it

1664
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:24,870
if it's allowed to establish those two

1665
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:27,450
connections from the same from the same

1666
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:29,700
port or if it has to open the news and

1667
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:32,360
socket and established two connections

1668
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:35,010
given to something

1669
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,929
it's Ghazi sure so to explain the shirt

1670
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:38,400
I think so my personal profits was a

1671
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,020
mosque that's what I put it in there but

1672
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,650
the reason I could live with assured is

1673
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:45,240
if you only violate that should when you

1674
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:46,530
know your clients and your deployment

1675
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:48,120
take your that work like that you are

1676
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:51,389
aware that this condition won't happen

1677
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:53,400
that's why that allows those use cases

1678
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:56,550
to still survive and not have to batter

1679
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,830
the bust that's why we care about but I

1680
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:00,660
would add a concept it's Austin are you

1681
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:01,920
very clear what options we want to move

1682
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:03,630
to the next issue but I think what do

1683
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,310
you want to see happening it's very if

1684
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:08,610
you take the action item of the river

1685
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:11,520
revving the PR we'd see if this

1686
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:14,670
discussion on the issue happening

1687
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:17,130
afterwards that lets us you know come to

1688
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:19,200
consensus on this if it sounds like it's

1689
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:21,780
a very small change and maybe then

1690
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,309
that's a small amount of discussion if

1691
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:26,420
there's any chance we can come back to

1692
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:28,320
this tomorrow but then you know it's

1693
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:30,690
we'll see what happens but that that

1694
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:34,410
would I think be what we're doing into

1695
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:36,240
the next steps here how all did the PR

1696
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:38,040
before tomorrow and then good decide if

1697
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:41,910
we have time for tomorrow night great

1698
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:43,170
thank you and if you're able to do that

1699
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:44,730
and you put something up please remind

1700
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:50,030
us tomorrow so we remember to come back

1701
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:50,030
to it let's move on

1702
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:59,870
next up is Unruh couple unrecoverable

1703
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:04,800
loss pattern leads to deadlock 2863

1704
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:11,220
Martin Stephen where are we at with this

1705
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:13,470
one can I can I make a procedural

1706
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:17,760
suggestion this is still being discussed

1707
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,690
in the design team sure so it I mean I

1708
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,400
would fall today

1709
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:25,070
yeah I'd punt it for tomorrow okay

1710
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:25,070
tomorrow might be good okay thank you

1711
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:39,210
that leaves us on 2763 coordinating spin

1712
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:42,599
Martin Thompson where we at

1713
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:45,540
I think this market proposed already I

1714
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,910
apologize but then there's a Fiat there

1715
01:22:45,540 --> 01:23:02,190
is a PR on this one that removes the

1716
01:22:47,910 --> 01:23:03,360
offending text it's very small let's

1717
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,809
discuss whether we think that's a

1718
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,809
terrible idea

1719
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:15,299
okay so we remove this text so the the

1720
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,940
specific text that's going away I don't

1721
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,830
know why others there's two changes here

1722
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,389
one of them takes connections and talked

1723
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:25,140
about network paths which i think is a

1724
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:27,180
an editorial change the the real

1725
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:34,560
substance of this change is that remove

1726
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:38,370
paragraph there no that was a separate

1727
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,840
that was simply a mention of this one so

1728
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:42,030
this PR change made some changes to

1729
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,200
network paths Ryan mentioned the other

1730
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:47,250
one I don't think that's the fix for

1731
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:49,800
this one says there's another that's a

1732
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:53,460
different pull request this is 2763

1733
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:54,810
right if you go back to that if you go

1734
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:58,110
back to that pull request we can look at

1735
01:23:54,810 --> 01:24:00,780
that paragraph because there's a PR that

1736
01:23:58,110 --> 01:24:03,719
I could find if we could but we can just

1737
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:05,790
look at the green text going down that

1738
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,050
paragraph there it says in case mom

1739
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:10,200
actions shape they share the same

1740
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:11,820
network path and there's and

1741
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,750
recommendations here about doing things

1742
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:17,549
like coordinating spin I think we have

1743
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:19,020
agreement amongst the people that are

1744
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:24,860
participated in the discussion anyway

1745
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:27,660
that this is aspirational at best and

1746
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:30,599
there is a PR I will find it I apologize

1747
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:33,150
for not linking it properly that to

1748
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,680
simply remove that paragraph okay is it

1749
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:36,269
worth discussing this anymore here or

1750
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,860
can we just get a normal process in this

1751
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:42,780
issue I will take the only process on

1752
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:48,269
this one okay great thank you all right

1753
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:52,130
that was 2763 next up is 2834 long

1754
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:52,130
header packets and router connection IVs

1755
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:06,780
hi Nick thanks Microsoft I opened this

1756
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,610
issue and we had a lot of discussion

1757
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:10,980
initially it was essentially stating

1758
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:14,099
that in the load bouncer stateless lis

1759
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:17,540
load balancing the long header packets

1760
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:20,580
based off of the destination IP address

1761
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:22,650
was not possible but we came up with the

1762
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:26,519
solution Thanks zu ho that you can use

1763
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:29,129
the long header source destination

1764
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,990
connection ID and it achieved the

1765
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:33,300
results of your need itself I don't have

1766
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:34,740
any further need to keep this open

1767
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,080
there's a little bit more discussion but

1768
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:39,630
I'm fine with closing this no I'm happy

1769
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:42,300
to close no actually yes anyone disagree

1770
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:43,710
with that okay I think we'll just do

1771
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,210
that the next round of consensus closed

1772
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:53,270
and that sounds nicely thank you very

1773
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:55,980
much excuse me that takes us to 27:17 in

1774
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:58,830
if you want to say let's reset you need

1775
01:25:55,980 --> 01:26:00,120
to send a larger packet than before this

1776
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:01,980
has been a fair amount of discussion I

1777
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,480
think we have an approximate proposal I

1778
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:07,379
finally wrote it up this morning

1779
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:09,660
politically so I I guess I would say

1780
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:11,730
since I just heard up like two hours ago

1781
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:14,130
maybe come back to it tomorrow if

1782
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:16,139
tomorrow after people get time to at

1783
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,790
least read the PR that's a bit but I

1784
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:20,190
think Martin I am David all kind of

1785
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:22,110
converged in a general shape it's just a

1786
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:23,309
matter of getting the text okay worded

1787
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,440
correctly because it's a little subtle

1788
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:27,960
if I could put the onus on you to remind

1789
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,669
us tomorrow to discuss that when the

1790
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,730
time comes I'm happy to do that thank

1791
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:31,730
you

1792
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:40,740
next up then 2785 David Ignasi to let

1793
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:43,160
disallow use of reuse of stateless reset

1794
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:43,160
tenants

1795
01:26:46,589 --> 01:26:55,510
it's me again so the current spec allows

1796
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:57,999
set block for each connection ID you

1797
01:26:55,510 --> 01:27:00,039
have locally you tell the other side

1798
01:26:57,999 --> 01:27:03,219
what the cross spawning citrus reset

1799
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:04,839
token is so that if you receive

1800
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:06,579
something later there you just send us

1801
01:27:04,839 --> 01:27:08,349
it reset and they know that it's a valid

1802
01:27:06,579 --> 01:27:12,728
sailors reset and they close the

1803
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:14,530
connection one of the interrupts one of

1804
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:17,379
the implementation was using all zeros

1805
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:19,599
father stateless recent tokens and

1806
01:27:17,379 --> 01:27:21,399
people are like oh this is breaking my

1807
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:25,179
code that's somewhat bad at text saying

1808
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:27,699
oh you could do that with so Martin add

1809
01:27:25,179 --> 01:27:29,619
it Thompson added some really good tax

1810
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:32,678
explaining the doubt side of doing that

1811
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:34,598
which is mainly that if you use them

1812
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:36,550
then there are some things the attacker

1813
01:27:34,599 --> 01:27:40,959
can do it looses the security properties

1814
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:43,599
of stateless reasons I was wondering if

1815
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:46,239
this is actually useful and if we could

1816
01:27:43,599 --> 01:27:49,119
just like instead of having all the text

1817
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:51,280
about oh here's the caveats because it's

1818
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:56,228
not a useful feature just say no we they

1819
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:57,579
have to be different and woulda yeah so

1820
01:27:56,229 --> 01:28:00,489
long terms it's not about losing

1821
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:02,949
security properties per se it's simply

1822
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:05,619
about additional steps that you have to

1823
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:07,148
take in order to ensure that you retain

1824
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:09,489
those security properties and it goes

1825
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:12,489
through what those are I specifically if

1826
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:15,009
you have to connection IDs that have the

1827
01:28:12,489 --> 01:28:15,428
same stateless reset of token associated

1828
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:17,859
with them

1829
01:28:15,429 --> 01:28:20,349
you can't forget one of the other well

1830
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:22,689
you can't forget one while the other is

1831
01:28:20,349 --> 01:28:29,289
still in play otherwise you end up with

1832
01:28:22,689 --> 01:28:31,629
in a nice Oracle so the questions for

1833
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:33,339
the group is do we want to have this

1834
01:28:31,629 --> 01:28:36,269
complexity that arcuate or do we just

1835
01:28:33,339 --> 01:28:36,269
wanna simplify things

1836
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:50,979
sir any good reason to reuse them let's

1837
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:55,179
hear that that's fast we saw I think we

1838
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:57,879
should diesel reuse because if ah if we

1839
01:28:55,179 --> 01:28:59,829
are all of us then we need to reference

1840
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:02,379
count on the receiver side the state

1841
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:05,709
let's reset tokens I mean because what

1842
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:08,439
many connection is might map to a single

1843
01:29:05,709 --> 01:29:12,369
state acceptable then if you are

1844
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:14,949
retiring one of those connection ID then

1845
01:29:12,369 --> 01:29:18,219
you need to decrement the state rested

1846
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:21,909
token refers constant and they keep it

1847
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:24,629
until it becomes zero so it's this is a

1848
01:29:21,909 --> 01:29:28,419
the translated a and this sorry

1849
01:29:24,629 --> 01:29:31,030
complication I say with a marginal

1850
01:29:28,419 --> 01:29:35,108
benefit at rest so I think we should you

1851
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:37,978
know this and make it simpler so you're

1852
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:37,979
supporting the proposal

1853
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:45,269
and just for my benefit did anyone want

1854
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:47,909
to speak for the status quo

1855
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:52,320
cuz I'm perfectly happy to just cut that

1856
01:29:47,909 --> 01:29:55,799
text okay

1857
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:59,369
oh sorry is there a PR for this one no

1858
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,869
there's no payout but we left it in an

1859
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:03,719
ambiguous state so it's good that we

1860
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:04,980
have this discussion and are we now

1861
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:06,989
placing a requirement upon

1862
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:11,129
implementation to generate this protocol

1863
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:15,959
violation so here's the requirement

1864
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:17,060
would be that they are unique or at

1865
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:20,070
least

1866
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:21,810
probabilistically unique I'm not going

1867
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:24,840
to require that they be unique in in

1868
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:25,440
absolute terms are unique within that

1869
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,190
connection

1870
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,509
ideally okay the scope of uniqueness is

1871
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,860
another problem that I want to talk

1872
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:35,880
about right now because that's kind of

1873
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:38,730
complicated but you would allow people

1874
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:42,090
to generate a protocol violation if they

1875
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:43,650
saw fit on the connection but allowed

1876
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:45,360
not you would know I require because

1877
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:46,619
tracking all of them is ridiculous and

1878
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,440
they're actively doing that that would

1879
01:30:46,619 --> 01:30:51,780
be my concern I would suggest maybe that

1880
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:55,199
we require protocol violation if any

1881
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:59,610
currently active if any to currently

1882
01:30:55,199 --> 01:31:01,080
active us no because that we do have the

1883
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:05,400
possibility of forgetting currently

1884
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:08,969
active ones so yeah I was almost there

1885
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:11,339
with you for a moment but yep okay it

1886
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:14,880
sounds like the next step is a PR will

1887
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:17,489
go through the normal process Martin do

1888
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,889
you want to write the peer should I call

1889
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:21,059
Thanks you're gonna write a David Martin

1890
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:23,360
said he like buttons you know can you

1891
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:26,969
say to yourself please

1892
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:29,119
you look Lars is assigning 2785 thank

1893
01:31:26,969 --> 01:31:29,119
you

1894
01:31:29,489 --> 01:31:36,860
that takes us to 27:41 revisit initial

1895
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:39,690
keys discard the ekor

1896
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:41,790
yeah procedural this is also stalled on

1897
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:44,099
the previous keys thing so we should

1898
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:49,580
probably punch punch um tomorrow yep

1899
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:51,960
please bring it up then thank you and

1900
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,340
we're getting into the assigned issue so

1901
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,510
we're gonna start asking if there's

1902
01:31:53,340 --> 01:32:00,679
progress and

1903
01:31:54,510 --> 01:32:03,260
we need to reassign these issues 25:34

1904
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:05,519
ecn tax disables ECM too aggressively

1905
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:10,289
this was raised by Martin Duke and

1906
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:12,510
assigned to Jonna Jonna in general um

1907
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:14,219
there's a piano didn't it's got some

1908
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:17,610
comments it's on me

1909
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:18,510
I'm gonna go update it and try to get it

1910
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:21,630
through this week

1911
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:24,239
ok anyone need to discuss anything about

1912
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:29,090
this one or just wait for that they are

1913
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:29,089
and therefore the process okay

1914
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:33,889
[Music]

1915
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:47,969
26:56 raised by and owned by Jonna gents

1916
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:54,018
okay discarding connection stated server

1917
01:32:47,969 --> 01:33:00,030
on unvalidated clients July yourself

1918
01:32:54,019 --> 01:33:02,940
this one I'm thinking should be mod

1919
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:05,759
editorial but there's a resolution at

1920
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:09,799
the end again there's basically

1921
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:15,690
clarification that needs to be added and

1922
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:23,150
this is yeah just sentence also that I

1923
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:23,150
need to add but it's not a design point

1924
01:33:24,829 --> 01:33:32,308
yes so you're proposing to flip this

1925
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:33,360
issue territorial yes okay if folks have

1926
01:33:32,309 --> 01:33:36,719
a look at that if anyone has an issue

1927
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:39,420
that please bring it up now or unless

1928
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:43,530
directly cherubs otherwise will flip at

1929
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:45,869
a time why aren't you okay with that um

1930
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:48,389
none Thompson I will want to check that

1931
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:52,199
this is fine but I'll wait for the PR

1932
01:33:48,389 --> 01:33:55,610
let me give me to do the PR and then in

1933
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:59,369
just remember remind ourselves that yeah

1934
01:33:55,610 --> 01:34:00,679
of this okay maybe record that in the

1935
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:06,110
issue that the intent is to flip to

1936
01:34:00,679 --> 01:34:06,110
character yes yes

1937
01:34:06,999 --> 01:34:14,780
that takes us to 25:41 clients cannot

1938
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,849
abandon initial packets well server see

1939
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:22,869
previous discussion about the scouting

1940
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:22,869
Keys okay that's one that cluster right

1941
01:34:23,109 --> 01:34:33,070
2496 version ossification use French

1942
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:35,389
nikka this has slides is there or here

1943
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:39,438
can we doing in 25 minutes we can

1944
01:34:35,389 --> 01:34:41,019
introduce it um we should start entirely

1945
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:43,429
up the chairs

1946
01:34:41,019 --> 01:34:48,619
well so we have that one and we have one

1947
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:53,119
two three four five nine issues left

1948
01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:55,159
they've all been assigned before this is

1949
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:57,289
one of our last big issues it's the

1950
01:34:55,159 --> 01:34:58,280
sauce version so I want of may push it

1951
01:34:57,289 --> 01:34:59,570
of tomorrow so we can have the

1952
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,789
presentation and the discussion without

1953
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:05,148
needing to rush and may be used for 20

1954
01:35:01,789 --> 01:35:06,919
minutes now - that's fine with me

1955
01:35:05,149 --> 01:35:08,959
the other possibility would be to

1956
01:35:06,919 --> 01:35:10,219
attempt to do it today on theory that we

1957
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:11,209
don't have any great solutions and

1958
01:35:10,219 --> 01:35:12,919
people when it gets on for something

1959
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:21,199
great overnight but I'm really happy to

1960
01:35:12,919 --> 01:35:22,459
out in white the Charest is you know my

1961
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:29,388
only concern is that that people might

1962
01:35:22,459 --> 01:35:31,699
lose state right we have a we have a

1963
01:35:29,389 --> 01:35:34,429
decent but not impossible list for

1964
01:35:31,699 --> 01:35:38,030
tomorrow um I think you missed a couple

1965
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:38,209
while you're away where does that leave

1966
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:40,478
us

1967
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:40,479
sorry

1968
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:48,349
right there it is 2084 discuss record

1969
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:52,190
with the connection ids not be

1970
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:53,660
correlative all and this was raised and

1971
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:56,120
I believe owned by ekor

1972
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:58,070
where are we at with this eka I promise

1973
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:59,690
to write text oh well I'll just write

1974
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:01,849
text it seems like I think this is the

1975
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:02,540
right tactic right I'll try that I'll

1976
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:06,020
try to do it now

1977
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:07,340
now like this week now now like

1978
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:18,680
depending on Thresh the issues on maybe

1979
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:21,050
right now now okay please do 2170 in bed

1980
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:26,390
quick version and expansion opened by a

1981
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:27,650
car owned by mt i think we came to

1982
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:29,180
conclusion that no action was needed

1983
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,860
Martin I don't agree on the taste if

1984
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:33,740
it's not it's just out of squat bias

1985
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:34,400
yeah so I didn't understand that clothes

1986
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,349
please

1987
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,580
always place clothes please alright

1988
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,870
we'll do that by the normal process

1989
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:42,650
anyone to have any objection to that

1990
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:46,300
here in the room okay we'll take it to

1991
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:46,299
the lists do consensus call thank you

1992
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:57,380
Eric are you gonna get up about that one

1993
01:36:52,760 --> 01:37:04,280
way this one okay need more conservative

1994
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:07,460
about migration to you opened by Eckhart

1995
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:09,110
yeah cuz I sent a PR for this there's a

1996
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:10,250
lot a lot a lot of discussion on this

1997
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:13,190
issue about a whole bunch of stuff that

1998
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:15,590
has been addressed by other issues so

1999
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:18,259
the final thing we talked about in the

2000
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:19,670
interim was basically we should have a

2001
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:21,260
threat model for migration of what we

2002
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:25,150
think different attackers can and cannot

2003
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:27,140
do and so this is purely documenting the

2004
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:28,940
capabilities that we think exists today

2005
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:31,340
if we don't like them we should open an

2006
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:33,860
issue to change those capabilities but

2007
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:35,450
this should not be any new information

2008
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:39,679
it's things that are stated elsewhere in

2009
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:41,090
the draft and collected so the contents

2010
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,470
of the PR are also right there on the

2011
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:47,540
issue so we don't have to look at it if

2012
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:49,850
- but so it basically I can go through

2013
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:53,120
it in about two minutes

2014
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:54,470
you have to which kind of turned into

2015
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,639
three types of attackers there's

2016
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:58,010
somebody who's on your path

2017
01:37:55,639 --> 01:38:00,679
and that's like a middle box that's

2018
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:03,320
routing you packets and that's great

2019
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:05,119
because they can do anything they want

2020
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:09,739
to your packets like not let them go

2021
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:11,598
through and that's a problem so they can

2022
01:38:09,739 --> 01:38:13,188
inspect packets modify packet headers

2023
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:15,439
obviously they can't change what's

2024
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:16,969
inside the ciphertext they can inject

2025
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:19,309
new packets they can delay the packets

2026
01:38:16,969 --> 01:38:20,570
randomly or with purpose and they can

2027
01:38:19,309 --> 01:38:23,389
drop the packets so that's somebody

2028
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:25,639
who's on path somebody who is off path

2029
01:38:23,389 --> 01:38:28,419
has the ability to see the packets going

2030
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:30,349
by so they basically have a tap into

2031
01:38:28,419 --> 01:38:31,639
somebody's sporting in their packets

2032
01:38:30,349 --> 01:38:33,979
where they can observe them some other

2033
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:37,130
way they can't cause those packets to be

2034
01:38:33,979 --> 01:38:40,130
dropped or delayed or modified in any

2035
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:41,570
way but they can copy them and inject

2036
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:43,369
them with their own modifications so now

2037
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:45,530
you have two packets which might either

2038
01:38:43,369 --> 01:38:47,929
be the same or subtly different and of

2039
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:51,349
course they can see all the external

2040
01:38:47,929 --> 01:38:53,449
bits of the packets an off path attacker

2041
01:38:51,349 --> 01:38:55,610
who I should have titled that long path

2042
01:38:53,449 --> 01:38:59,209
attack another a limited on path

2043
01:38:55,610 --> 01:39:03,860
attacker has the ability to inspect

2044
01:38:59,209 --> 01:39:06,679
packets and modify some of the ones that

2045
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:09,469
are going by but you you end up with the

2046
01:39:06,679 --> 01:39:11,539
situation where somebody has forwarded

2047
01:39:09,469 --> 01:39:12,739
your packets faster than the original

2048
01:39:11,539 --> 01:39:13,999
packets where you get there so there's

2049
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:16,098
two copies of the packet in the network

2050
01:39:13,999 --> 01:39:17,959
so the one that's going through them

2051
01:39:16,099 --> 01:39:20,419
they can modify but for example if they

2052
01:39:17,959 --> 01:39:23,389
delay it beyond the other copy the other

2053
01:39:20,419 --> 01:39:26,749
copy wins and gets there first so if you

2054
01:39:23,389 --> 01:39:28,699
keep scrolling to the guarantees yes

2055
01:39:26,749 --> 01:39:31,099
that one will become much more clear if

2056
01:39:28,699 --> 01:39:33,409
you're asking about the third one yeah

2057
01:39:31,099 --> 01:39:35,630
so an on path attacker can screw you

2058
01:39:33,409 --> 01:39:37,249
completely because they're on path and

2059
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:38,389
you need them to move your packets and

2060
01:39:37,249 --> 01:39:40,999
if they don't move your packet so you

2061
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:43,760
don't have a connection so that's pretty

2062
01:39:40,999 --> 01:39:46,249
much what 1 2 3 & 4 say there there's a

2063
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:50,929
little bit more nuance there around

2064
01:39:46,249 --> 01:39:53,719
migration where like point to if you are

2065
01:39:50,929 --> 01:39:56,869
an on path attacker you and you are on

2066
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:59,809
path for both the paths that the

2067
01:39:56,869 --> 01:40:01,579
connection is currently on and the path

2068
01:39:59,809 --> 01:40:05,300
that a endpoint is trying to migrate to

2069
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:07,999
you can prevent that migration however

2070
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:09,530
you should not and we believe currently

2071
01:40:07,999 --> 01:40:10,880
cannot prevent migration

2072
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:13,460
to a path for which the attacker is not

2073
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,690
on that so if you are on one path but

2074
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:18,500
not on the other you can't stop me from

2075
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:20,329
switching to that other one and point

2076
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,340
four here is kind of the obvious like

2077
01:40:20,329 --> 01:40:23,659
yeah you can screw up the connection if

2078
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:27,050
you delay packets or drop them or

2079
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:28,129
something like that so that's on path

2080
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:31,610
attackers do you're basically screwed

2081
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:34,369
because they're on your path off path

2082
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:35,750
attackers can race packets and we make a

2083
01:40:34,369 --> 01:40:37,098
couple assumptions about an off path

2084
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:40,190
attacker in order to have it be the

2085
01:40:37,099 --> 01:40:42,619
absolute worst case possible so an off

2086
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:45,019
path attacker we're going to for now

2087
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:46,519
assume has the ability has some magical

2088
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:49,219
better routes to your actual destination

2089
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:50,809
where they can race a hundred percent of

2090
01:40:49,219 --> 01:40:53,059
your packets and have a hundred percent

2091
01:40:50,809 --> 01:40:54,889
of those packets get to the server first

2092
01:40:53,059 --> 01:40:56,510
we're also going to assume that they

2093
01:40:54,889 --> 01:40:59,690
have unlimited resources to do things

2094
01:40:56,510 --> 01:41:01,309
like attack Nats and cause you to rebind

2095
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,750
and take over your old court on that

2096
01:41:01,309 --> 01:41:04,579
nack and get super lucky about which

2097
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:06,020
port they end up with and so we're

2098
01:41:04,579 --> 01:41:09,079
basically looking for the worst possible

2099
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:10,520
thing that could have happened and in

2100
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:12,440
that worst possible case and we believe

2101
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:14,449
it's a fairly rare case but it is

2102
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:16,759
possible that an off path attacker can

2103
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:21,769
take your packets and offer you improved

2104
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:23,840
routing to your endpoint and they can

2105
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:27,590
then become what I've named the limited

2106
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:30,770
on path attacker so they can do that

2107
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:33,230
yeah I'm sorry I feel like I'm losing

2108
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:34,690
the plot here on an off path that area

2109
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:36,709
doesn't get copies your packets right

2110
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:38,269
they do okay that's right that's the

2111
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:40,849
bonus is it so it's not off pot in the

2112
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:42,409
conventional sense not just one and we

2113
01:41:40,849 --> 01:41:43,880
should we should indeed rename it

2114
01:41:42,409 --> 01:41:44,900
because there's some other text in here

2115
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,730
about the difference between an active

2116
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:49,638
and a passive attack and yes thank you

2117
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:51,079
very so there there's this is strictly

2118
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:52,940
defined as an active attack and this is

2119
01:41:51,079 --> 01:41:54,920
somebody who's getting copies so yes

2120
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,969
this is a man on the side and I'll

2121
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:58,429
actually go through in the PRA and

2122
01:41:55,969 --> 01:42:00,710
rename it more fully I have a reference

2123
01:41:58,429 --> 01:42:02,030
to the definitions of those names and I

2124
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:05,599
use them in one place but it'd be nice

2125
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:09,139
to use them everywhere consistently so

2126
01:42:05,599 --> 01:42:11,300
yes so let's see point to hear you're

2127
01:42:09,139 --> 01:42:13,190
off path attacker can forward packets

2128
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,020
and offer you improved routing and she

2129
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:17,989
will use that improved routing the

2130
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:20,420
difference between at which point they

2131
01:42:17,989 --> 01:42:23,199
become kind of on path which is why I

2132
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:25,249
call it limited on path

2133
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:26,509
because there's still a copy of your

2134
01:42:25,249 --> 01:42:28,610
packets going over your original path

2135
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:30,110
and so an on path attacker can just drop

2136
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:32,449
your packets and then you're screwed a

2137
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:35,299
limited on path attacker can drop your

2138
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:37,909
packets and you're just fine because the

2139
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:39,559
original copy still gets there so that's

2140
01:42:37,909 --> 01:42:41,690
the that's the difference there so for

2141
01:42:39,559 --> 01:42:43,400
example if I'm sitting here on the side

2142
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,589
and forwarding all your packets I can

2143
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:47,388
delay them to slow you down

2144
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:49,849
only as slow as the original one until I

2145
01:42:47,389 --> 01:42:51,949
start losing the race and this gets kind

2146
01:42:49,849 --> 01:42:54,679
of finicky and tricky so we can draw

2147
01:42:51,949 --> 01:42:55,909
some pictures and stuff but let's see so

2148
01:42:54,679 --> 01:42:57,050
an off path attacker should not be able

2149
01:42:55,909 --> 01:43:01,070
to cause a connection to just straight

2150
01:42:57,050 --> 01:43:03,409
up clothes they should not be able to

2151
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:05,659
cause migration to a new path to fail if

2152
01:43:03,409 --> 01:43:09,920
they can't also observe and get copies

2153
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:12,440
and race packets for the new path if

2154
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:14,210
they can observe that they can become a

2155
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,978
limited on path attacker if you migrate

2156
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:18,590
to that new path and they can also

2157
01:43:15,979 --> 01:43:21,979
attack an app and pretty very attractive

2158
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:24,289
yes in the interest of time um that may

2159
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:26,479
be point so we're good

2160
01:43:24,289 --> 01:43:27,650
oh then no most of all pretty much all

2161
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:29,030
of those attacks are already described

2162
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:31,489
in the text this just collects them all

2163
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:33,289
in one place okay so that is actually

2164
01:43:31,489 --> 01:43:34,999
last point Thanks

2165
01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:38,090
I have people had a chance to look at

2166
01:43:34,999 --> 01:43:40,699
this probably not it was less than very

2167
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:43,130
recent okay so what we might do is uh

2168
01:43:40,699 --> 01:43:46,098
let folks have a chance to catch up with

2169
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:47,269
it and then if there's no further

2170
01:43:46,099 --> 01:43:50,749
comment we'll go ahead and see if we can

2171
01:43:47,269 --> 01:43:55,219
get consensus on the list any other

2172
01:43:50,749 --> 01:44:01,099
thoughts about it right now okay thanks

2173
01:43:55,219 --> 01:44:03,519
for doing that Eric next up articulate

2174
01:44:01,099 --> 01:44:08,920
principles of definition of error codes

2175
01:44:03,519 --> 01:44:13,659
2388 opened by MT and owned by empty

2176
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:13,659
there is a full request for this one

2177
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:26,470
I would like feedback on that one 2880

2178
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:28,120
yeah I got some positive feedback none

2179
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:29,980
of it was particularly negative I don't

2180
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:34,480
think although there was a request to do

2181
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:37,480
the same for HTTP HTTP has the

2182
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:42,450
distinction of having both connection

2183
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:46,240
and stream local their own codes and so

2184
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:48,970
it would be slightly expanded text but

2185
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:51,280
this this both defines what the

2186
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:55,630
principles are and also expands on some

2187
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:58,840
of the error handling advice I guess we

2188
01:44:55,630 --> 01:45:02,050
have in the document so um this was

2189
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,400
about the peers betcha we told ya

2190
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:06,100
something like I think it's ready for a

2191
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,759
proposal ready I probably should have

2192
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:09,010
done that already

2193
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:10,600
yeah okay go ahead and do that well go

2194
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:12,430
ahead and give me a consensus dollars

2195
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:15,150
then hey folks haven't had a chance to

2196
01:45:12,430 --> 01:45:15,150
look at it please Jim

2197
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:27,040
next up write up our security target

2198
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:29,500
against on path attacks this is whatever

2199
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:33,820
it was just talking about 11 hours ago

2200
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:37,390
oh okay it's the same it's effectively

2201
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:39,309
the same text isn't it it's almost the

2202
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:41,650
same text there was some discussion at

2203
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:42,820
the previous interim about ekor building

2204
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:44,080
on top of this with some of the other

2205
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:46,000
sections that are in there so there's

2206
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,320
some TBD in the PR for like here's a

2207
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,090
bucket but that should probably have a

2208
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:50,469
separate issue than that one sorry there

2209
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:54,520
was a lot of noise do you say it's ready

2210
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:56,920
or not the current PR covers the

2211
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,720
migration cases here my understanding of

2212
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:00,490
this issue is it's a security target

2213
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:02,860
against an on path attack for during

2214
01:46:00,490 --> 01:46:04,630
things like the handshake etc and so the

2215
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:07,000
current text that is being added has a

2216
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:10,150
section for handshake and the contents

2217
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,850
is TBD with the intent that this issue

2218
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:14,710
or a similar issue to be written by

2219
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:18,340
somebody in line behind me can fill that

2220
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:20,560
in okay yeah I can take that Randy that

2221
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:22,390
ball too quickly I was basically I need

2222
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,310
a taxonomy for it which I had kind of

2223
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:25,750
half in my head which now Eric has done

2224
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:28,630
and so like I can go in that quite

2225
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:29,800
quickly so I'll review his and then

2226
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:31,179
write some section

2227
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:34,750
it sounds like I was ready new section

2228
01:46:31,179 --> 01:46:36,480
rather than a PR okay so we'll wait for

2229
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:40,960
them

2230
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:46,360
22:05 Johnna artists act and act frame

2231
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:49,300
must not decrease oh yes by Google hey I

2232
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:51,790
think we decided that we didn't want to

2233
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:54,520
do anything about this I think this is

2234
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:55,719
closed with no action unless I'm miss is

2235
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:59,320
that correct Anna can you give me a

2236
01:46:55,719 --> 01:47:01,889
thumbs up or do you not remember so Ian

2237
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:05,290
doesn't this go to the easy end problem

2238
01:47:01,889 --> 01:47:07,659
that I don't know but don't we have a

2239
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:09,580
separate issue yes we do that we just

2240
01:47:07,659 --> 01:47:13,239
discussed it and Jonna said that it was

2241
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:17,320
in progress I think this was the fix to

2242
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:18,780
the to that problem so right can you

2243
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:21,429
remind me John

2244
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:23,259
hey I think the conclusion was that we

2245
01:47:21,429 --> 01:47:25,869
were not going to change this PR this

2246
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:31,599
issue but we were going to document the

2247
01:47:25,869 --> 01:47:40,000
ecn issue so no design change on this

2248
01:47:31,599 --> 01:47:41,409
issue there was a resolution documenting

2249
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,780
the other issue yeah if you have a few

2250
01:47:41,409 --> 01:47:46,480
hundred progress maybe once that's done

2251
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:48,519
this case closed with it right we

2252
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:52,089
discussed on the PR and I think the PR

2253
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:58,900
has the appropriate resolution to the

2254
01:47:52,090 --> 01:48:01,630
ecn issue so my recollection and it's on

2255
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:04,269
the issue so I get this wrong I

2256
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:06,460
apologize was that we would not require

2257
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:09,250
that the largest acknowledge continued

2258
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:13,420
monotonically increase but we would I

2259
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:17,679
like the fact that if it does not then

2260
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:20,530
you run the risk of disabling ACN and so

2261
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:22,630
there would be an encouragement to have

2262
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:24,849
the value increased this is to

2263
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:26,980
accommodate all of those absurdly

2264
01:48:24,849 --> 01:48:28,900
limited devices that only seem an

2265
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:31,269
acknowledgment for a single packet and

2266
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:34,598
things like that yeah you're gonna add I

2267
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:36,400
should there and basically say I spend

2268
01:48:34,599 --> 01:48:39,099
all the consequences right and follow

2269
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,150
the show is there anything useful for

2270
01:48:39,099 --> 01:48:41,590
the working group to discuss right now

2271
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:46,808
no

2272
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:48,969
we have a proposal yeah me what was what

2273
01:48:46,809 --> 01:48:51,489
was useful was airing that and saying

2274
01:48:48,969 --> 01:48:53,469
guarding nod and that was worth the time

2275
01:48:51,489 --> 01:48:54,699
was my writing so we'll wait to hear

2276
01:48:53,469 --> 01:48:57,099
from the editors is when they think they

2277
01:48:54,699 --> 01:49:00,969
have a proposal ready yeah the peer

2278
01:48:57,099 --> 01:49:06,030
should be ready soon and again that

2279
01:49:00,969 --> 01:49:06,030
needs an authentication okay thank you

2280
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:16,179
excuse me next up 23:42 raised by igor

2281
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:19,780
and owned by some bits flying between

2282
01:49:16,179 --> 01:49:22,690
hearing eric smith connection migration

2283
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:25,030
as a defector there's a PR that should

2284
01:49:22,690 --> 01:49:26,500
be ready to go ready to go okay should

2285
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:28,210
already be reviewed I think Martin

2286
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:31,960
needed to click a button on it but other

2287
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:33,250
than that right anyone have something

2288
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,300
want to discuss about that or can we

2289
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:40,599
just go ahead and try getting sense

2290
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:42,099
analyst you were yeah I said technically

2291
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:44,199
that they are as good it's done

2292
01:49:42,099 --> 01:49:47,440
I would edit I would add some more

2293
01:49:44,199 --> 01:49:49,239
verification of why the servers are

2294
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,848
gonna do it and what clients would do

2295
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:55,690
with this knowledge editorial so

2296
01:49:51,849 --> 01:49:56,920
technically it's ready yeah that's an

2297
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:59,678
interesting point so there were some

2298
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:02,800
questions raised about whether or not

2299
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:05,440
that transport parameter should exist or

2300
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,880
didn't and as part of that if it

2301
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,769
continues to exist we should have some

2302
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,309
editorial text explaining why it exists

2303
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:14,380
and when you would use it and if it

2304
01:50:11,309 --> 01:50:15,909
doesn't exist then we don't need that so

2305
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:17,559
I didn't add that text here because if

2306
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:22,839
it if the outcome of that is it doesn't

2307
01:50:17,559 --> 01:50:24,610
exist then there's no point right so

2308
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,639
we're ready to go in terms of try to get

2309
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:28,719
consensus okay so we'll go ahead and put

2310
01:50:27,639 --> 01:50:32,739
that the next batch of consensus of

2311
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:36,190
calls that thank you and that takes us

2312
01:50:32,739 --> 01:50:38,379
to almost the end 2389 be clear about

2313
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:42,638
the purpose of disable migration that

2314
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:46,030
sounds million yeah

2315
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:49,829
okay so Saanich same same resolution

2316
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:49,829
then finally 2602

2317
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:58,809
raised by Jonna assigned to a an idle

2318
01:50:57,519 --> 01:51:01,389
time that needs a more descriptive end

2319
01:50:58,809 --> 01:51:03,549
more description sorry I meant to read a

2320
01:51:01,389 --> 01:51:04,389
PR for this I apologize I get married

2321
01:51:03,549 --> 01:51:06,429
one fight tomorrow

2322
01:51:04,389 --> 01:51:07,899
so just get to it when you can okay we

2323
01:51:06,429 --> 01:51:10,839
don't necessarily need by tomorrow we

2324
01:51:07,899 --> 01:51:13,479
just need to see its emotion tomorrow is

2325
01:51:10,839 --> 01:51:18,489
a good time okay so that takes us to the

2326
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:22,179
end of the accepted design issues on the

2327
01:51:18,489 --> 01:51:24,068
late stage drafts which is a very

2328
01:51:22,179 --> 01:51:26,019
specific set of constraints but still

2329
01:51:24,069 --> 01:51:27,669
yay us

2330
01:51:26,019 --> 01:51:29,769
we have a number of them that we defer

2331
01:51:27,669 --> 01:51:32,199
to discuss tomorrow hopefully we'll have

2332
01:51:29,769 --> 01:51:35,409
a nice chunk of time to do so

2333
01:51:32,199 --> 01:51:37,388
and then that that leads me to believe

2334
01:51:35,409 --> 01:51:41,648
we might be in a state where those

2335
01:51:37,389 --> 01:51:43,239
drafts at least will be able to be

2336
01:51:41,649 --> 01:51:45,639
moving a little bit towards working for

2337
01:51:43,239 --> 01:51:47,829
last call or at least stability shortly

2338
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:49,719
after we get all those incorporated I

2339
01:51:47,829 --> 01:51:51,039
think tomorrow will result at the end of

2340
01:51:49,719 --> 01:51:52,689
this discuss planning and one of the

2341
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:55,568
things we'll talk about is the other

2342
01:51:52,689 --> 01:51:57,010
drafts the HDP and recovery drafts

2343
01:51:55,569 --> 01:52:01,030
getting them into that late stage

2344
01:51:57,010 --> 01:52:02,409
process offline I think maybe we should

2345
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:04,869
talk to the editors about whether there

2346
01:52:02,409 --> 01:52:06,339
any HTTP or recovery issues that we need

2347
01:52:04,869 --> 01:52:08,438
to carve out some time for tomorrow

2348
01:52:06,339 --> 01:52:11,199
because the ones that we did defer to

2349
01:52:08,439 --> 01:52:13,329
tomorrow could take a significant chunk

2350
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:17,499
of time based on the interrelationships

2351
01:52:13,329 --> 01:52:19,808
they're generally anger we we punted on

2352
01:52:17,499 --> 01:52:22,599
some issues during the interim from

2353
01:52:19,809 --> 01:52:24,309
recovery to the IETF because we want of

2354
01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:26,019
the broader idea of audience be present

2355
01:52:24,309 --> 01:52:28,599
yes we should make sure to get to those

2356
01:52:26,019 --> 01:52:32,319
tomorrow right all right then we need to

2357
01:52:28,599 --> 01:52:34,479
probably go away and come up with a run

2358
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:35,889
list for tomorrow that incorporates all

2359
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:37,389
those issues we deferred but leaves time

2360
01:52:35,889 --> 01:52:41,559
for that and the planning discussion

2361
01:52:37,389 --> 01:52:43,329
that'll be the bulk of the day I we've

2362
01:52:41,559 --> 01:52:45,519
got eight minutes left I don't know that

2363
01:52:43,329 --> 01:52:46,599
we can really use that productively

2364
01:52:45,519 --> 01:52:49,469
unless we want to try and have the

2365
01:52:46,599 --> 01:52:49,469
planning discussion now

2366
01:52:54,290 --> 01:53:01,150
I remember there was a look at you

2367
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:09,389
does anyone have anything that we can

2368
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:21,060
productively discuss in now effectively

2369
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:23,580
five minutes sure great hi Brian

2370
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:26,670
Crandall toreador of the manageability

2371
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:28,200
and applicability dress um there are a

2372
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:32,850
few open issues on these you can maybe

2373
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:36,239
like um many of these are things for

2374
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:37,770
which before the just before the draft

2375
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:40,219
outline the area and I went through and

2376
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:42,840
basically put some text in for them

2377
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:45,840
there are some that we will need some

2378
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:48,090
help from people you will see that aside

2379
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,739
from one of these which is assigned to I

2380
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:53,489
think that's the that's the picture that

2381
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:55,739
means Yoon's but is that from two of

2382
01:53:53,489 --> 01:53:57,000
these there are not people assigned we

2383
01:53:55,739 --> 01:54:01,459
may be coming to some of you in the

2384
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:04,680
hallways and press ganging you into um

2385
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:06,390
providing us some text for these um if

2386
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:07,950
you would like us if you would like to

2387
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:09,600
like what through this if you list and

2388
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:12,300
see if there's you can volunteer to add

2389
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:15,380
syntax that would be even more pleasant

2390
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:17,790
for us again for you thank you very much

2391
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:19,140
thank you Brian I think it's easy for

2392
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:21,480
people to forget that we have these

2393
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:22,860
drafts they're becoming more important

2394
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:25,049
and I think we'll be spending more time

2395
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:27,269
on them as the core the base drafts

2396
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:30,210
settle down so expect to see these more

2397
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:31,860
on there's a couple of meetings you can

2398
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:34,650
take a minute or two also to talk about

2399
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:36,089
sort of what the plan would be now going

2400
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:38,700
forward or the work includes right I

2401
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:40,980
mean we still have quite a few issues

2402
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:43,679
open that's all we did today we didn't

2403
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:45,690
get through them all this is also still

2404
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:47,190
quite a longer list of editorial issues

2405
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:49,259
some of them are not you know

2406
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:51,509
spelling fixes but actually require some

2407
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:53,070
work but it's um some work willing to

2408
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:56,310
happen on the draft so but we hope that

2409
01:54:53,070 --> 01:55:01,110
once of the design issues are more or

2410
01:54:56,310 --> 01:55:02,640
less done we can hope is that the drafts

2411
01:55:01,110 --> 01:55:04,940
enter a period of stability where maybe

2412
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:07,590
a Troyer stuff gets fixed but we're not

2413
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:09,330
hopefully gonna do more design work and

2414
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:11,330
that allows the implementations to catch

2415
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:13,350
up

2416
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:16,230
hopefully this could be after the

2417
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:19,469
September October inner end so we will

2418
01:55:16,230 --> 01:55:20,009
say what we said before that maybe in

2419
01:55:19,469 --> 01:55:22,560
Singapore

2420
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:25,260
if that plant hands out we can actually

2421
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:28,410
spend the session on some things that

2422
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:31,440
are not be one related and there's

2423
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:33,480
there's quite a few proposals around I

2424
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:35,790
think the the ones that certainly seems

2425
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:38,160
to draw a lot of interest inside the IGF

2426
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:40,560
it's things related to RTC web there was

2427
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:42,269
the whole dispatch thing yesterday and

2428
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,510
but if there's other things that we have

2429
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:48,450
for example multipath as an item on our

2430
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:50,760
Charter which is it feels like this will

2431
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:52,860
be a much harder much longer-term thing

2432
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:56,610
and it's also maybe not quite as

2433
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:58,410
urgently needed as the RTC stuff but RTC

2434
01:55:56,610 --> 01:56:01,019
could be a topic that we spend a session

2435
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:02,630
on in Singapore if you guys stop opening

2436
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:06,810
new design issues for a moment

2437
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:08,820
Eric Eric Kinnear Apple there's also the

2438
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:11,070
quick I'll be draft which in my mind is

2439
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:13,230
kind of coming with the one not with the

2440
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:14,820
stuff after and we should probably give

2441
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:17,849
that some airtime and ask people that

2442
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:19,019
like read it correct cuz that's another

2443
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:21,540
one that we've maybe been forgetting

2444
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:22,830
exists that is one that sort of I feel

2445
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:24,720
that this has a natural home in this

2446
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:26,460
working group while the RTC web

2447
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:28,920
discussion is a much larger one right

2448
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:30,830
and there will certainly be most pieces

2449
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:33,960
probably will not be in this working

2450
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:34,800
yeah but by talking saying we'll spend

2451
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,690
some time talking about something like

2452
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,130
RTC whatever it doesn't mean that that

2453
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:39,450
work will be done here it just means it

2454
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:41,280
will start to have a discussion with me

2455
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:43,200
so we're talking to the area directors

2456
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,389
about what the proper dispositions of

2457
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:50,519
things like extensions versus new

2458
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:52,500
applications using quick might be this

2459
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:54,570
is about nuga I'm gratified to hear that

2460
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:56,520
you believe that that this working group

2461
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:58,230
is the home for that however I remind

2462
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:01,610
the chairs that has not been adopted and

2463
01:56:58,230 --> 01:57:04,139
I wish and I said it's not a home for it

2464
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:05,670
potentially not we still haven't decided

2465
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:07,920
what the disposition for things like

2466
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:08,970
extensions and new applications using

2467
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,160
clickers are going to be

2468
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:15,270
Oh quick I'll be specific quick I'll be

2469
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:16,500
specific lecture yes so um I not not

2470
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:18,030
probably Montreal but I would like

2471
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:20,220
certainly in the interim to get some

2472
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:21,840
time to discuss it with a group and move

2473
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:23,130
for adoption and then we can iterate

2474
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,230
further off of there I think it's

2475
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:27,090
important that it at least be an adopted

2476
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:29,129
document before we go to RSC would be

2477
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:32,580
one the people have guidance on how to

2478
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:33,880
do this and I think that the the

2479
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:35,769
discussion of that is

2480
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,530
is probably a prime thing for Singapore

2481
01:57:35,770 --> 01:57:40,690
that sense yeah or maybe even at the

2482
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:43,000
internet way up time it would probably

2483
01:57:40,690 --> 01:57:44,589
require some small amount of recharging

2484
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,090
because at the moment we have a pretty

2485
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:48,460
specific list of work items and that

2486
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:49,840
isn't one but but you know we wrote that

2487
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:52,420
charter like years and years ago when we

2488
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,949
didn't know about this stuff um I'll

2489
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:55,510
make you a deal that that we we do a

2490
01:57:53,949 --> 01:57:57,719
call for adoption when you keep your

2491
01:57:55,510 --> 01:58:06,370
hands off the Marion for a couple months

2492
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:07,900
I'm never gonna live that down am i I do

2493
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:10,960
have a bit of a worry that we're gonna

2494
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:12,879
start discussing RTC etc before we start

2495
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:16,810
discussing what we currently labeled as

2496
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:19,120
v2 features I'm worried that we're gonna

2497
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:20,560
start discussing WebRTC etc before we

2498
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:24,250
start discussing what are currently

2499
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:27,100
labeled as v2 features either getting v2

2500
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:29,110
chartered or something like that would

2501
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,969
be a really good idea before we start

2502
01:58:29,110 --> 01:58:33,280
discussing with RTC and quick in

2503
01:58:30,969 --> 01:58:35,620
particular because otherwise I think

2504
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:37,300
we're gonna end up with outcomes that

2505
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:46,420
would be very different than what would

2506
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:48,580
happen otherwise general you go I don't

2507
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:51,850
think that the quick help me to have

2508
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:56,519
needs a change in the Charter we already

2509
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:56,520
have some text that says we will discuss

2510
01:58:56,580 --> 01:59:01,269
specific sensors how quick and

2511
01:58:59,409 --> 01:59:03,879
describing deployment and manageability

2512
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:05,920
implications of the protocol it goes a

2513
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:09,850
little bit past just the implications I

2514
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:11,770
guess but yeah let's not lawyer up on

2515
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:13,780
charter changes right now it's just it

2516
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:15,670
may be necessary want to talk TVs

2517
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:16,929
because my back time for magnets to

2518
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:18,730
figure out whether you know he's

2519
01:59:16,929 --> 01:59:20,139
comfortable with us just taking that on

2520
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:22,269
under the current Charter on it's really

2521
01:59:20,139 --> 01:59:29,370
a narrow director decision whether you

2522
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:29,370
know anything else for today

2523
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:33,820
okay we'll see everyone tomorrow

2524
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:36,329
hopefully and continued a good pace of

2525
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:36,329
work thank you

2526
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:43,210
that's premature you haven't signed the

2527
01:59:40,989 --> 01:59:44,558
blue sheets yet you can come up and you

2528
01:59:43,210 --> 01:59:47,460
can also bring them at least one of them

2529
01:59:44,559 --> 01:59:47,460
is still out there somewhere

2530
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:25,679
go on they see Jim Kyle the Union our

2531
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:28,009
village why I know you guys are talking

2532
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:32,100
about the intermediate yeah I've space I

2533
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:35,430
saw your email yes yes to 270 I think

2534
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:38,940
it's a matter of funny way to room

2535
02:00:35,430 --> 02:00:43,220
whether it's bogus to get there yeah

2536
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:43,219
what your nearest major airport Oh

2537
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:55,520
you
