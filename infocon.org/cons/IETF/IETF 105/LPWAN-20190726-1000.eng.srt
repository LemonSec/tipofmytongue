9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,899
hello - Alex will be joining us from

10
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:10,060
Ithaca but it was much easier that just

11
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:13,120
I mean it could stand with me at the

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,650
chair so with this we're staying as

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,350
usual we won't distribute the blue

14
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:21,580
sheets immediately we'll wait like 10 to

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:25,210
15 minutes so the usual late people so

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,789
this is an IETF official meeting all the

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:31,119
best practices of ITF meetings apply in

18
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:33,790
particular the rules about patterns if

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,220
you're aware of any IPR that applies to

20
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,290
the discussion that takes place in this

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,869
room whether it's from your sponsors or

22
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,729
weather please let us know or refrain

23
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:47,140
from talking about this and if you don't

24
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:49,000
want to speak during the meeting you may

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,090
always talk to the chairs after the

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,520
meeting the other best practices also

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:59,470
apply anti restaurant and all the others

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:03,158
so they are listed on this page the

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,408
meeting is being filmed and recorded and

30
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,489
actually it will be published on Yahoo

31
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:11,500
on YouTube I'm sorry yet and actually

32
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:17,279
what's very cool is you can extract the

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,279
transcripts from the YouTube page

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,290
I'm sure you can make a rule that

35
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,579
translator

36
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,500
yeah with YouTube and fix me so yeah so

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,870
everything is recorded minutes are being

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,510
taken blue sheets will be distributed I

39
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:36,040
want to make sure that we have people

40
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,880
joining the etherpad that's the mean we

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,660
used to take minutes what's very cool is

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,650
you can join it online and if you speak

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:50,230
to the mic please check after that what

44
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,060
you said was captured quietly make sure

45
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,209
that your name was kept shot correctly

46
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,910
so we publish accurate minutes okay so

47
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,560
please all join these the pad and and

48
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,350
preview the minutes as they are being

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:09,310
taken mostly if you've been speaking so

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,570
who can take minutes okay we have two

51
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,220
three

52
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:21,160
is there somebody on the on the double

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:23,170
even you yes okay thank you okay and

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,480
then the other material is available on

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,458
this page it's it's also available from

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,989
the agenda page on the IETF site and

57
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,630
that's actually what we use to go from

58
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,880
from presentation presentation so we

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,070
have a lot on our plate today but we

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,530
have 2 hours some kind of confident that

61
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,489
we won't have any problems I won't be

62
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,530
pressing people I don't think so the the

63
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,170
new thing compared to the agenda that we

64
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,170
had published or till about date is that

65
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,489
we have an interesting presentation on a

66
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,899
shield limitation coming from Chile so

67
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,680
this one will be actually appended to

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,300
the presentation by Adam in each so in

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,040
those 15 minutes I guess the mini will

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,380
speak for like 10 minutes and then we

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:11,530
will be able to discuss I don't know any

72
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:13,870
provinces psychic the by Sheik since so

73
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,130
we'd be able to do this case that has

74
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:21,130
value will at some time then six arcs

75
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,990
no one so this time there was a lot of

76
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,750
work done on the lower one specification

77
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,700
many discussions on the mailing list so

78
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,350
we we gave more time to even so we can

79
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:38,180
we tell us the best and latest about how

80
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:42,860
low how one profiles shake then the data

81
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,080
model and actually I just got a text

82
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,550
from sera she said I won't be joining

83
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,750
the meeting immediately cover start

84
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:53,150
without me said yes if so why she's not

85
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,490
there at the time after the young thing

86
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,229
I would like to push it till he arrives

87
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,100
but I guess you will be there because

88
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:04,610
it's now an hour from now

89
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,980
then the co-op's magic context who I am

90
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,280
to the minimal step to discuss I am

91
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:14,900
again and Calais will show us the

92
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:18,109
progress until the discussion Charlie

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:21,289
was supposed to to present to give us an

94
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:25,400
eye Tripoli status as it goes

95
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,990
Charlie did not join the mythical so I

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,289
don't know if you would be with us if

97
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,200
Charlie you could join let us know do

98
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,800
you sit shown in a Michiko all right

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,599
don't

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,460
so I'm not too sure that we will have

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,930
Charlie this time but ok we'll get the

102
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,760
news next time and and then we'll

103
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,740
discuss free chattering because we are

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,230
pretty I mean the basic OBE so I show

105
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,950
here so the bearing thing for which

106
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,890
offering was complete chick so chic is

107
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,909
now past so we can very actively work on

108
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:02,510
the rich after now and that's it so as

109
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,700
just said main work item is now complete

110
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:10,730
that's the baseline chick technology and

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:13,700
that was main effort in this group we

112
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:17,360
plan to submit the coop compression to

113
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:20,740
ASG November no ha we still in line with

114
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,940
disco I think we are from the last intro

115
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,940
from your perspective it's okay

116
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,970
so we'll have we'll have a discussion at

117
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:35,470
the end about rich chattering Suresh

118
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,470
that's pretty much it for the intro

119
00:06:41,680 --> 00:07:08,949
any bashing hello good morning and so

120
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:12,580
this is a stages about the basic sheet

121
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:17,680
draft ipv6 static context were currently

122
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:20,440
in version 21 so I'll spend just one a

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,210
minute or two remembering people what

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,430
this draft is about so it should new to

125
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,650
the working group if you haven't looked

126
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,560
at that before you here's your chance to

127
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:32,679
understand what this is about and then

128
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,259
I'll go over what we've done since last

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,020
I definitely a little report on the

130
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:42,729
hackathon we had we can just before this

131
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:45,310
week and what's coming up after this and

132
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:47,590
in the back of the slides have the list

133
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,110
of changes if there's any question of

134
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:56,619
what exactly we did we can go over that

135
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:59,020
but otherwise just skip it and then so

136
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,560
what sister after bad I like to say

137
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,229
there are three parables in one draft

138
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,720
one deliverable is a generic header

139
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:10,990
compression mechanism that uses a static

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,590
context this gives the name shake to the

141
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,639
whole technology static context header

142
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:23,948
compression so it's that thought in blue

143
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,680
in my protocol stack here in option ipv6

144
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,169
UDP but actually nothing in this header

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,930
compression mechanism is dedicated to

146
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:34,750
these protocols so we can apply it to

147
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,828
anything that regular has things that

148
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,690
that look like headers in the same draft

149
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,609
we also have the specification of a

150
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,579
fragmentation protocol and we have three

151
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,680
versions of fragmentation free modes

152
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:50,699
which address different underlying

153
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,339
network requirements these are

154
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,300
free boxes of described here and it's

155
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,120
kind of compression over fragmentation

156
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,709
it's not really encapsulated that gets

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,280
people a little bit confused sometimes

158
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:08,400
we need to be better at explain and in

159
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,230
the same draft we have a simple example

160
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,079
I would say of how we can apply

161
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,590
compression to ipv6 UDP it's simple

162
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,100
because we don't consider ipv6 versions

163
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:20,280
options sorry

164
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,950
and so all the fields are happen only

165
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,589
once and fixed in position fixed in

166
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,160
length so it's pretty simple and the the

167
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,160
more complex stuff comes before in coop

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,020
so this is a red box here so you will

169
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,180
find these free things in the same draft

170
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,880
and so other graphs do the rest of the

171
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,520
stuff like this red box shows the coop

172
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,030
draft so applies had a compression to

173
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,300
all this upper protocol stack and the

174
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,640
other drafts like she calls it foxy over

175
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,180
Laura that we'll hear about today

176
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,360
do these red boxes how do we apply

177
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,800
mostly fragmentation over various

178
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,170
technologies because they have their own

179
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,120
specificities and so they pick you one

180
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,490
or two or three of the fragmentation

181
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,950
modes and set parameters so that it fits

182
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,190
the characteristics the underlying

183
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,570
technology so that's my view of the

184
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,540
whole work we're doing in this working

185
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:24,960
group yeah and so far the draft I'm

186
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:29,250
talking about has specified the format

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,100
of frames that go over the air of the

188
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,250
three person to the underlying layer but

189
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,770
so far we haven't defined how we express

190
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,900
how we represent the rules that are used

191
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,630
for compression and fragmentation so a

192
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,120
part of the other drafts propose a

193
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,040
representation of the context the rules

194
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,350
the parameters for fragmentation and

195
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,339
everything this way this is not in this

196
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:56,940
draft okay what has happened since the

197
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,860
last meeting so fairly long list of

198
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,090
technical stuff but we had

199
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,910
IOT idea review by custom which was

200
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,610
funny ha

201
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,980
of the document we discuss with Caston

202
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,950
at Prague and agreed on most of the

203
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,850
changes we improved the description of

204
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,670
ikana Road there was mistakes in the

205
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,010
description

206
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,170
we received received an ad a review by

207
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:27,040
Suresh

208
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,160
it's a completed ITF last goal I haven't

209
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,640
heard of any comment so so far looks

210
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,000
good and we published 20 and 21 in the

211
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:42,310
last few days so the account status is

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,620
waiting for write-up for me yeah so it's

213
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,109
like a procedural step for me to issue a

214
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,000
ballot like so it gets like on the next

215
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:59,920
available filly chat so that's so you

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:01,870
don't have to worry about a chai issue

217
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,520
the ballot and the author updates the

218
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,230
draft raft is saying hey or this review

219
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,540
and I'm fixing it right and then the

220
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,220
some of the IES she read an older

221
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,050
version and some of them read the newer

222
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,030
version and that kind of like I wanted

223
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,189
to avoid that and in any weights idea we

224
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,810
usually you don't do anything like like

225
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,570
because nobody's going to start working

226
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,880
on it so this afternoon like it should

227
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,470
be pallet and then we get on like next

228
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,350
like giving the number of pages so

229
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,840
previously you placed us explicitly on a

230
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,060
Tele chat but now it's like automatic so

231
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,440
it looks at the reading load and then

232
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,670
puts it on until the chat so I'm

233
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,130
expecting the 22nd of August if he be on

234
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,660
until chat okay so it seems like people

235
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,730
time to read the stuff like all the

236
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,130
Directorate reviews and everything and

237
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,900
so on whatever it's like left over

238
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,210
because some of the directorates to last

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,069
call and tell each attributes separately

240
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,170
so like Jenna's for example does it

241
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,270
separately so they do a last cause

242
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,900
review and look at the updates and do a

243
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,699
tell etcetera reactor okay so I don't

244
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,920
expect any anything to come out of it

245
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,510
but they they do one the time to do that

246
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,640
so they can expect like two week window

247
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,060
so that's what I'm saying 22nd would be

248
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,160
a to date so and if you want like a

249
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,479
style like dominate like if you want to

250
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,560
be on the call you can be able to call

251
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,999
you cannot speak and less like in

252
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,439
and let's give you but you can be on the

253
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:20,689
call anybody can be an observer on the

254
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:22,069
call but I could pack Stella hey like

255
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:23,389
you know if I have some questions for

256
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,160
you you can actually answer it so it

257
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:27,829
gets done quicker rather than make

258
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:35,569
another two weeks okay yeah if possible

259
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:37,040
I'd like to be on the call so you can

260
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:42,860
decide if you want to join so it's about

261
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:49,839
it 4:00 p.m. and in France like Thursday

262
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:52,309
okay thank you thank you so much just

263
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,779
just a quick read report on the

264
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:58,639
hackathon there were 10 team members

265
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:02,779
over the weekend yeah

266
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,300
went seven here on free remote from

267
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:09,230
Chile is been in Japan so actually it

268
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,819
was the Soh he worked overnight for us

269
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,980
and when we came back in the morning he

270
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:18,378
had and quite a lot of work our night so

271
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:20,750
that was really great and so we

272
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,269
basically worked on two fronts one is

273
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,519
make open chic easier to use so

274
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,829
producing documentation cleaning up a

275
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,459
dinner a tutorial how you get surf

276
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:35,359
install it and also improve the

277
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:37,579
functionalities of the code quite a lot

278
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,309
of work merging several branches that

279
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:44,989
kind of diverged between meetings so we

280
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:47,149
now have a compression and fragmentation

281
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,269
integrated into the same brain sync

282
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:53,089
which wasn't the case before and I'll

283
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:56,300
talk about em later

284
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:58,069
coming up legs well nothing Suresh

285
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,069
described but it's going to come in

286
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:03,439
terms of the draft itself and we want to

287
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:05,209
communicate more about shakey educate

288
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,589
people about chick we get lots of

289
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,050
question I don't quite understand how

290
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:12,439
this works etc so we kind of agreed

291
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,079
we'll prepare a full-blown tutorial on

292
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:18,410
check that we can create the lower lines

293
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,378
or other groups that are interested in

294
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,420
carrion will open check of course in I

295
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:28,480
know this economic work to evaluate

296
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:30,430
performance and applicability this is

297
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,990
outside the draft itself but just to

298
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,859
communicate with you the kind of

299
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:38,350
interest we get about chick so of course

300
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,360
there are other drafts of this same

301
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:46,779
working group that use shake obviously

302
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:49,079
but the most happening club CDTI PVC

303
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,149
compression overall one over six Fox

304
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,979
already a couple years ago coop

305
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,680
compression of our LTM so we're not

306
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,839
compressing UDP ipv6 but just a co-op

307
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,760
part of an IP enabled Network and still

308
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,699
getting benefit of the compression so

309
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,430
just even to mention that co-op is not

310
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:09,490
shake is not dedicated to the IP layer

311
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:13,660
to sit below the IP layer it can sit at

312
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:18,459
any any point in the stack as a sexual

313
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:21,329
oral one and shake is being evaluated to

314
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:24,189
the lower Alliance for the LMS

315
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:27,930
transmission or lower one so they have

316
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:31,600
the LMS over UDP IP OSX and so we have

317
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:35,229
you deploy ipv6 or wrong one so that

318
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,570
could solve that problem Daniel here is

319
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,269
interested in using shake for IPSec ESP

320
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,490
compression and in terms of

321
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:45,070
implementation we have open shake which

322
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,250
already mentioned we have a Cleo they

323
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,560
have commercial card both in C and go

324
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,209
language both for the devices in the

325
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,149
network so commercial-grade

326
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,920
operational and I just showed last week

327
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,269
about the new implementation so Sondra

328
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,178
is going to tell us a little bit about

329
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,359
it just after my my presentation and

330
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,220
riot have expressed interests are not

331
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,129
currently actively working on it but

332
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,140
they have intention of implementing

333
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,870
implementing open shake in right either

334
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,370
by rewriting a C implementation which

335
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:23,260
would be for a different implementation

336
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:28,530
or by running micro - overwrite and

337
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,530
using reusing some of the open G code

338
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,780
okay well Joanie to go over the changes

339
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,770
do you have any specific question home

340
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,120
now it's there for reference so I guess

341
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:46,389
you can tell us about

342
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,389
your implementation any question

343
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,750
okay hello everyone so I'm Sandra says

344
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,540
bells from Universidad de Chile and I

345
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,160
will present a lot from actually this is

346
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,030
a world from the legal he's a master

347
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,880
student and this year we started

348
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:30,270
implementing the draft or she cover

349
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,160
loyal one so I'll just give a brief

350
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,340
report of what is the status of this

351
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,380
implementation so basically this is the

352
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,280
architecture that we are using this is

353
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,640
our experimental setting so we have a

354
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,540
low pi end device which is connected to

355
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,770
a rack wireless gateway and then this

356
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,600
connects to the the things network and

357
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:57,929
the other part of shake is implemented

358
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,070
in Amazon Web Services so he's using API

359
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:05,100
gateway talking via rest to the network

360
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,770
server and the actual implementation of

361
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:13,169
shake is in in lambda function inside

362
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:16,889
the AWS services so this is the status

363
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:19,440
of the implementation what you see here

364
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:22,230
on the right is the the modules that are

365
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,090
that are part of the implementation so

366
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,370
basically we have a big module with

367
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,290
compression the compression and the

368
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,780
other module is for fragmentation and

369
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,670
reassembly the one that is almost ready

370
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,030
is the first part the compression the

371
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:39,480
compression this has a compressor which

372
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:42,450
gives the output aesthetic packet and

373
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,450
then the die compressor which received

374
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:49,020
the chip packet and the output is an

375
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:51,179
ipv6 plus a UDP packet and then there is

376
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,030
a parser that gives us access to all the

377
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,070
headers in a chic packet and the rural

378
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,200
manager which is a one that loads the

379
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,750
specific rule that we need to apply for

380
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,510
for a compression action so all the

381
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,250
rules are implemented outside in a

382
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,110
dictionary and then the role manager

383
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,520
just loads the specific rule that we

384
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:16,530
need to apply for a compression and then

385
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:18,480
so this is around a 90 percent ready

386
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,580
they have fragmentation and reassembly

387
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,179
module this is in charge of an aura

388
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,120
student so I will see his work next week

389
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,610
and then I can tell you if this is also

390
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,178
working or not I couldn't say yet if

391
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:36,678
it's working I already said this so so

392
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:39,409
far we we have tested the day uplink for

393
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,299
the compression and it's working we

394
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,460
haven't yet tested the downlink but the

395
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,668
coldest is their Israeli we just need to

396
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,529
do the testing and also for the

397
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:53,480
fragmentation we haven't done any tested

398
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:56,059
any testing yet what we have pending

399
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,379
still so this 90% comes that from the

400
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,690
fact that we haven't yet implemented

401
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:01,908
these two compression the compression

402
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,669
actions which is mapping certain at

403
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:06,350
least be basically because so rodrigo

404
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:09,619
said he's connected actually he said

405
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:13,189
that he wasn't using them and so he just

406
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:15,830
skipped the implementation for now and

407
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,860
then as i said we need to third attack

408
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,189
the downlink for the compression and we

409
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:26,330
want to do one end-to-end testing with

410
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,309
with all the IP connectivity entrant so

411
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,230
this is this is gonna be the last part

412
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,480
to test so we plan to do it first for

413
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,710
only for only for the compression and

414
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,440
then we have when we have the

415
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,399
fragmentation convey to then they're

416
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,779
complete thing and i was gonna say

417
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:52,428
something else well i forget so that i

418
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:55,789
think thats so maybe we can try to make

419
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:56,899
some interrupting as soon as you give us

420
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:06,320
rules right

421
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:09,199
it's all my fault no Nadia just UDP yeah

422
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,350
it's just and and and also we plan to

423
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,269
make the code public so it's not there

424
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,889
yet we haven't documented the code yet

425
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:17,360
but it's gonna be available so we will

426
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:23,439
tell the group when their code is is

427
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:26,449
ready to to access control and so I I

428
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:31,629
understand that your presentation is 50%

429
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,629
ready but did you look at the other one

430
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:41,210
[Music]

431
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:43,400
both both yes boss both of them so I

432
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,980
what I understand is that Rodrigo

433
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,690
whatever he couldn't find in one he just

434
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,280
went to the general one and then

435
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:55,850
implemented wattage another one said

436
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:58,000
yeah okay thank you thank you very much

437
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,740
we're very interested in your feedback

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,360
if you saw anything missing you know

439
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:10,690
trying to do this connaissance of the

440
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:13,549
Aloha world and if we find something

441
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,110
thank you very much and understand he

442
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:19,960
will be at the next meeting in Singapore

443
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:22,729
right no I mean you already grow your

444
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,040
atom yeah so maybe we can plan for

445
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,040
interrupts let's work on that

446
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,830
I hope it's very clear to everyone in

447
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:37,100
the room that was very critical now is

448
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,870
to get a command format for the rules so

449
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,909
we can feed the rules into both

450
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,500
implementations and try one

451
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,210
implementation on one side and do the

452
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,220
implementation on the other side right

453
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,690
right now is kind of blocking us for

454
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,490
interrupt because we can't express the

455
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,679
rules in the fashion that both codes can

456
00:23:49,490 --> 00:24:04,040
digest so that's really the next

457
00:23:51,679 --> 00:24:04,400
important step for us good morning

458
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,799
everyone

459
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,740
Carlos so you get from seefox so I'm

460
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,610
gonna talk about the the draft IETF lp1

461
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:16,100
chic over sea Fox just a quick note to

462
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,799
say to welcome the new member in the

463
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,928
group because alex is not here and I

464
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,240
think I saw Alex in the note there so

465
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:25,809
congratulations Alex on the arrival of

466
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,809
the new member

467
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:35,550
so yeah very quick update there is we

468
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,260
have none modifications to the draft

469
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,080
what we've been doing is working on

470
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,330
optimization of the sea shake parameters

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,520
for payload fragmentation and data

472
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,899
integrity over sick folks as a reminder

473
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,670
sig Fox has a fixed say size for the

474
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,000
payload so in the uplink is 12 bytes in

475
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:56,580
the downlink is 8 so basically we can we

476
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,560
can optimize for that one single frame

477
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,810
size that that is not changing and

478
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,429
that's idea to to make sure that that we

479
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,139
add to the to the best possible numbers

480
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:06,690
for the different applications that we

481
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,440
foresee to to use this data integrity

482
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,120
and fragmentation so we have two basic

483
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,540
scenarios the first one is a single bag

484
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,260
header that is right now optimized for

485
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:22,470
minimum overhead in providing an ACK

486
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,379
size of 13 bits in the downlink and the

487
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,480
other one is two might shake uplink

488
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,770
heathered that is optimized for maximum

489
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,770
payload with an ax sighs after 43 bits

490
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:37,650
in the downlink so this is more or less

491
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,960
what the the simulations look like if we

492
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,140
want to push the limits what a single

493
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,420
byte header we can go all the way to

494
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,090
roughly 300 bytes a little people with

495
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:52,110
that but 300 bytes are comfortably and

496
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:56,790
this is using the icon arrow mode so the

497
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:59,580
idea sorry maybe has to support this

498
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:02,430
payload with as little as a single byte

499
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,750
and 13 base needed meaning that in the

500
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,610
best-case scenario if there are no

501
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,950
fragment losses of course we will use a

502
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:11,729
single a single downlink message to

503
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,300
support all those four messages sent in

504
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:19,590
the uplink to support 300 bytes for a

505
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,960
2-byte shake uplink Heather again on the

506
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,000
icon or mode we can support all the way

507
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,450
to two thousand bytes not only sorry

508
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,080
that it's recommended but that's what it

509
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,580
would work then again one as little as

510
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,879
one single act would be needed to

511
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,320
support all that payload and in this

512
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,019
case it'll be our 43 bit act that

513
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,049
fits perfectly finding there in the sea

514
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:46,389
Fox a downlink so we plan to keep

515
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:49,029
working on this and of course bring in

516
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:51,100
bring it to to implementation to try to

517
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:57,580
test the limits of the protocol and see

518
00:26:51,100 --> 00:27:02,769
how we can sorry we can we can further

519
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:13,960
optimize the protocol so that's it

520
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:53,100
any questions okay thank you and the

521
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:58,899
next presentation will be 25 minutes

522
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:01,449
okay so here everyone my name is Eva

523
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:04,239
Petrov and I will be presenting the

524
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:09,399
advancement of the sheikah vellore one

525
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,710
trust and so he will start by giving you

526
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,289
a little bit of context about laura1

527
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,100
then I will present you the changes that

528
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:20,799
happen since the last IDF and then I

529
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,279
will tell you what was some of the

530
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,769
rationale for the changes that we did

531
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,840
and we can have a discussion if you have

532
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,840
any ideas or any comment

533
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:38,918
so in Lourdes there are three types of

534
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:42,309
devices three classes those are across a

535
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,700
B and C Class A are the most constrained

536
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:48,360
once that can receive down links only

537
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,299
after sending me a drink

538
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,219
Crosby chef

539
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,649
sometimes words at which they can

540
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,820
receive darlings and Class C code

541
00:28:55,649 --> 00:29:02,549
through C's downlink anytime

542
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:05,279
obviously this is important in terms of

543
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:08,249
how the fragmentation is specified

544
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,659
because sometime ours might differ

545
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:18,809
between the different classes then they

546
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:21,509
are confronting messages that I will

547
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:25,070
also tell you a little bit more about

548
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:29,549
what is our opinion a little bit later

549
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:31,249
and another particularity of flora one

550
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:33,749
is that there are multiple

551
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:37,409
implementations of network servers and

552
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:39,929
device tax which means that there might

553
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:45,179
be some differences in implementations

554
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:48,950
that do not allow to use some of the

555
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:54,289
nice properties of underlying there and

556
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:57,960
so there are parts in the Mac layer

557
00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:01,320
headers that could arise ice or that

558
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:05,369
could be useful for us to use name the

559
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:08,399
effort and effort which I will show you

560
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:12,539
in a second how they they are structured

561
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:15,869
and the last particularity that I want

562
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:18,600
to mention right now is that due to some

563
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:23,908
differences in regulations in different

564
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:28,199
countries the maximum size of packets is

565
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:30,840
quite a bit different between optimum

566
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,179
redu conditions and supporting mo Radio

567
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,678
conditions in some parts of the world so

568
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,879
this is also something we have been

569
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:44,340
taking into consideration when providing

570
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:49,049
the parameters for the laura1 or the

571
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:55,168
Sheik fragmentation so as you can see in

572
00:30:49,049 --> 00:31:00,179
this picture we have different headers

573
00:30:55,169 --> 00:31:05,010
in the lower one packets and some of

574
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:11,940
them namely the folks used for optimum

575
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:14,700
session of radio have to write your

576
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:19,010
links and some other things that are

577
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:23,570
below IP but they can vary in size which

578
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:27,000
could make a little bit harder the

579
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:31,770
selection of most optimal parameters for

580
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,170
all types of payloads sizes and then

581
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:37,500
there is the effort that I mentioned

582
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:41,910
earlier which is mostly for applications

583
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:45,960
to specify what what is the payload

584
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:48,300
about and I will explain how we use it

585
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:55,530
in order to communicate information

586
00:31:48,300 --> 00:32:00,389
related to and she crew ID so since the

587
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:05,430
last IDF in Parc our document was

588
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:10,080
adopted by the working group and it was

589
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:15,630
in version 3 now we have published two

590
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,330
new versions and we received some very

591
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:22,140
useful feedback so thank you everyone

592
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:29,399
that gave us has some ideas some

593
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:33,150
recommendations so here are the changes

594
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,840
that went in the document since the

595
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:42,660
version that was accepted by the working

596
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:51,810
group I think there's something in there

597
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:54,630
here I have been talking about some of

598
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:59,190
them at the last idea but they were not

599
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:00,990
part of the chart so as some of them

600
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:10,220
still changed so I will present them

601
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:18,000
again here so we updated the information

602
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:32,940
we've dated we got in sync with base

603
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:36,420
document so sorry so we got in sync with

604
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,780
the base document and updated some of

605
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:44,610
the terminology and some of the figures

606
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:47,760
to match the base document we decided to

607
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:50,159
switch to icon error for uplink

608
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,030
fragmentation and so we believe it to be

609
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:57,090
more optimal for those cases for the

610
00:33:54,030 --> 00:34:02,460
downlink fragmentation we decided to

611
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:05,490
keep the course modest Class A devices

612
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,380
we will need to be sending up Linux in

613
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:15,000
order to be able to receive the download

614
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:18,510
links anyway and so we provided some

615
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,790
more details how Laura one terminology

616
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:29,010
maps to ITF terminology so that people

617
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:32,279
from both as deals and read the draft

618
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:40,460
easily without having to keep too much

619
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:42,870
information in their heads and we

620
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,230
decided to replace the quite generic

621
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:48,629
term devices which seem to be confusing

622
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,810
for some readers with the more precise

623
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:53,810
one and devices where it was appropriate

624
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,890
so we then decided to split the airport

625
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:16,209
up that we were using for a clique

626
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:19,750
fragmentation into two so that we have

627
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:23,200
one which is more optimal for smaller

628
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:29,710
packets and one that can handle the

629
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:32,040
requirements of ipv6 packets

630
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,040
yes

631
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:50,100
those one of the airport is the

632
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,100
possibility to be used also for

633
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:57,100
compression whereas this is the F port

634
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:00,850
of default and the airport up short is

635
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:03,520
only for fragmentation basically in F

636
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:06,790
port up short you don't have any space

637
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,509
for additional row IDs so you have

638
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:13,300
effectively only one row ID and in the

639
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:16,420
case for F port of default you have

640
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,360
space for other room IDs so one of them

641
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:36,310
is for fragmentation and the rest of

642
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:44,680
them so that we select F word for

643
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:47,350
fragmentation compression Airport

644
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,319
circuit the National the ignited that

645
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:53,470
the rule IP and the rest of the paper

646
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,750
below after that is different in

647
00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:00,129
fragmentation than in compression so

648
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:02,980
actually having silver rule I t4f balrog

649
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:06,060
default as know using fragmentation

650
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,390
itself and it's consuming a lot of it's

651
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,320
okay

652
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:13,890
that interesting we can consider it yes

653
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,890
the Minich

654
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:21,920
as a ninja you know I think the way it's

655
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:25,760
described currently I think it's

656
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:31,099
confusing it's been this use of F ports

657
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,920
and roll numbers it's basically the way

658
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:36,920
and have had this discussion on the

659
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,980
missus is that you the weights country

660
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:44,890
describe it looks like you have actually

661
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:47,270
three instances of shape of the context

662
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,700
separately and of course that it's one

663
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:53,780
of the instances for example the F

664
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,790
bought up short this needs one context

665
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:01,400
which has only one room therefore you

666
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:05,720
need three bids and default has an 8-bit

667
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,430
a space for good idea so either you I

668
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,609
mean there's nothing wrong with that but

669
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:13,310
then you should describe it this way we

670
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:16,520
have three contexts that are selected by

671
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:20,750
foot or the way I focus on mailing lists

672
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:25,099
you describe normal IDs to include this

673
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:27,940
F fortified and so if we useful ID

674
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,950
numbers that have at least eight bits

675
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,260
which overlap with the support of Lauren

676
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:37,279
and maybe have some other bits so

677
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:41,300
variable length encoding and the thought

678
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,510
up short uses only a bit and which is

679
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,980
its value of F port so in the vision of

680
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:50,230
shape this means you have only one

681
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:53,150
context recruits very good idea

682
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,460
so either one of the other if obviously

683
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:58,030
agenda is exactly the same you get the

684
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:02,380
same compression same frames out of the

685
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:06,950
but the description would be so pick one

686
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:09,770
of the two but should be clear I think

687
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:23,200
how could you actually proposed text the

688
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:23,200
week okay yeah thank

689
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:30,170
from from Java Rodrigo Munoz is fighting

690
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:37,390
out on some platforms you cannot access

691
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:42,230
the airport so for example in icon okay

692
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:45,170
Olivia is oblivious that it's possible

693
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:49,730
there so so what if you can come to the

694
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:52,730
mic so I will just hello perfect

695
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,720
yeah vertical you can access GF buttons

696
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:57,200
of icon

697
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,660
I think it's the Roman structure that

698
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,350
circuit or something like that I can't

699
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:06,259
find the documentation if you want if

700
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:09,049
it's a lower one certified device be

701
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:12,490
able to access efforts because it's the

702
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,490
part of the lower one specification

703
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:18,709
thank you

704
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:22,100
so Richard you if you have questions you

705
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,800
can find that you know of Olivia and ask

706
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:27,100
him he'll be glad to help you I'm sure

707
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,100
of it

708
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:41,480
ok so I carry on as we have said Paris I

709
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:43,370
sell three bikes in order to be able to

710
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,960
optimize for the different radio

711
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:51,500
conditions as I said earlier in some

712
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:58,580
regions the maximum packet size is 11

713
00:40:51,500 --> 00:41:00,890
bytes and in case there is some that are

714
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,500
present this might be reduced even

715
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:06,940
further that's why we decided to keep

716
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,940
some flexibility there

717
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:17,090
and yes we updated the terminology to

718
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:17,930
match that of the - 18 version of the

719
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:23,570
sheet raft

720
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:29,540
I mean added extra examples yes the

721
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:34,609
rocker the title 3 bite is just was

722
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:41,960
a shot or is probably it's forever

723
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:44,930
fragmentation and yes we received some

724
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,630
feedback from the chairs that we need to

725
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:55,819
real connect the author list so we did

726
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:58,400
that and yeah we we hand out some minor

727
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:08,050
other comments from the working group as

728
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:12,829
well yes and here is an example of the

729
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:18,760
pellet format so we have at the upper

730
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:23,540
side of the slide the regular packet for

731
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:30,650
the short illusion and which doesn't fyd

732
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:34,220
and window number and we have in the

733
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,710
down part of the site fragmentation

734
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:40,220
where we have those two additional

735
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:46,099
fields so one is for F poor chart and

736
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:49,930
the other for the effort of default in

737
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:56,119
the short version we have detailed

738
00:42:49,930 --> 00:43:00,020
accounts and then the pivot and we only

739
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:02,500
use one byte for the additional header

740
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,500
yes

741
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,530
she typed one bit is expiry is really

742
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,460
just going in such case or is it

743
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:21,640
something we can skip I was wondering if

744
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,640
the lowercase D type in one bit is

745
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:41,029
the Tigers production the first one in

746
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:43,220
state your name so together but it's

747
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:46,099
also when you finished your transmission

748
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:50,479
you have to delay and wait if you have

749
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:53,390
some so you must keep your context or a

750
00:43:50,479 --> 00:44:02,450
certain period of time so using the de

751
00:43:53,390 --> 00:44:04,879
tag another fragment and she came again

752
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:09,979
from chemic so this means that you can

753
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:15,499
mix up to session or to a place with one

754
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:19,788
bit because I believe we said in the

755
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:22,430
beginning of the draft - not until the

756
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:27,170
fragments yes that's correct

757
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:28,489
I mean so yeah I always surprised to see

758
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,739
the tight bits

759
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:33,140
yeah even though you said you don't

760
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:35,890
intend finally you could do with that I

761
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:40,489
think you I did it just for extra safety

762
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:43,788
think it's moment okay you think lists

763
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:47,869
for extra safety yeah maybe a little you

764
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:51,890
want to act so system yes he do you me I

765
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:56,599
have connection issues very well perfect

766
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:59,390
so we did detect just days of hello

767
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:03,789
recovery because it's faster to detect

768
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:07,308
an issue when the detect change but we

769
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:11,569
specify that we don't want to use and to

770
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:14,150
mix to session at one time because we

771
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:21,099
are in embedded contacts with lot of

772
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:25,579
constraints so it radius provinces and

773
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:29,150
or all memory and RAM needed in

774
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:31,839
microcontrollers and subdued simplify

775
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,839
implementations

776
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:40,310
oh good but it was when we thought that

777
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,860
it was better to have better light

778
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:45,440
hitters it was a meat neck so it can be

779
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:50,660
discussed and we are open for feedback

780
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,190
on that I figured that if you have all

781
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,290
sorts of timeouts and rest condition

782
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:56,510
that avoids race conditions with time

783
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:58,180
outs opening somewhere I guess it's a

784
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:08,930
good idea

785
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:11,230
Thank You Lily okay so yes and over here

786
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:14,118
you can also see the format of the

787
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:17,390
acknowledgement I hope that doesn't come

788
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:24,260
as any surprise for people that know the

789
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:28,759
original sheet dropped so we have in the

790
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:33,350
details if it the encoded bitmap in case

791
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:37,130
of an error

792
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:46,940
I mean missing fragment and then padding

793
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:52,070
has made it so caring come for the

794
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:57,230
version two we mostly did some very

795
00:46:52,070 --> 00:47:01,180
small changes fixed some figures updated

796
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:05,119
the reference to - 19 and make sure that

797
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:09,919
we are in sync with this version of the

798
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:17,390
trust and fixed some examples and added

799
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:20,150
some more another bushes for example I

800
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:22,759
saw that they are not white bind in the

801
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,859
sheet compressions I'm a bit afraid of

802
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,530
the implementation issues it can break

803
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:29,359
so the confession residue is not the

804
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:31,490
white line and the paper comes right

805
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,470
after so I guess this is the decision

806
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,890
you make here but when you get so more

807
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,890
rational

808
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:49,200
so the decision for the residues himself

809
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,900
to be bit is for compression efficiency

810
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,169
so if there's only one bit of entropy in

811
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:59,130
some field and we only send one bit on

812
00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:02,190
the wire and then the question was do we

813
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:07,880
had to abide alignment after the

814
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:10,589
residues before the payload but then I

815
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,940
think the reason was that we would get

816
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:15,869
to padding's

817
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:18,750
and begin case of fragmentation and so

818
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:22,319
we decided would had only once and that

819
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:26,099
why we we stuck the payload right after

820
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,710
the residues and we we work under the

821
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:32,940
assumption that shifting is no costs at

822
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:35,760
one CPU cycle and so extracting the

823
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:40,440
bytes with shift doesn't cost compared

824
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:43,760
to sending a bit link more computation

825
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,529
power than transmission on opportunities

826
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,809
and there are long threads on the

827
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:50,700
mailing list on that so you can take

828
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:55,529
more and come back to us and ask

829
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:57,779
questions thank you just for to make

830
00:48:55,529 --> 00:48:59,819
good point shaking it is quite easy but

831
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:03,029
chichi turkey egg whites like in the

832
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:04,890
example we have might be might be

833
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:09,839
complex for the implementers but okay

834
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:18,960
fine developed I think is the iteration

835
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:23,220
thank you thank you so now things that

836
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:26,880
have been discussed as possible coming

837
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:32,308
changes is to remove the restriction of

838
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:37,170
the row ID size basically right now we

839
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:41,279
are saying we recommend people to use

840
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:46,589
the to have ports and have row size of

841
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:49,170
six bits but in some applications that

842
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:51,069
might be insufficient in others it might

843
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:55,809
be Morden

844
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:59,259
enough so the comments that we received

845
00:49:55,809 --> 00:50:01,119
to us to try to really organize the

846
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:04,690
draft so that we don't have these

847
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:07,630
restrictions and this is something we

848
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:11,819
intend to do have some specified

849
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,819
varieties that are recommended for

850
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,059
fragmentation maybe still keep two of

851
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:21,448
them that is something who you have to

852
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:25,239
to decide I think we'll keep two of them

853
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:27,640
but in any case the applications should

854
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:29,819
I mean implementers should have the

855
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:36,969
flexibility to decide what is the

856
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:41,788
optimum ROI decides for them and they're

857
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:45,940
having some small typos and some small

858
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:49,269
details that were missed missing in the

859
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:53,680
draft and that were maybe confusing a

860
00:50:49,269 --> 00:51:00,218
little bit implementers so we will be

861
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:04,479
fixing those so now about some more

862
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:07,630
technical details in water there is a

863
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:10,538
bit which is called F pending which can

864
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:16,930
tell an end device that the network has

865
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:19,449
more data to send to it in the draft we

866
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:25,479
explicitly state that we don't want to

867
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:29,380
rely on this thing because it is not

868
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:31,538
handled very well by some of the

869
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:35,859
implementations so it might cause some

870
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:39,400
issues and similarly for a confirm

871
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:43,140
versus and comfort misuse it is possible

872
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:46,539
for some stacks to send a confirmation

873
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:49,538
before the Sheik payer and the sheet

874
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:53,380
layer can actually attend the extra

875
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:57,699
payload and the confirmation could very

876
00:51:53,380 --> 00:52:00,130
well be piggybacked with the Sheik

877
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:03,900
payload so it didn't make too much sense

878
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:06,660
to use confirmed messages in this wreck

879
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:14,249
we might be sending more messages than

880
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:18,538
needed so now a little bit more details

881
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:24,089
why we decided to do step size of tree

882
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:27,499
but after some consideration and running

883
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:31,200
some experiments we found that this is

884
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:34,319
this seems to be the optimal at

885
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:38,939
ourselves if we want to be able to vote

886
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:43,859
from time to time sent some commands

887
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:47,339
using the F hoped header in door one and

888
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:53,609
at the same time be able to say to send

889
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:57,359
big payloads without using too much size

890
00:52:53,609 --> 00:53:02,220
in the me in the bitmaps the bigger

891
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:04,890
terms improved the bitmap size but at

892
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:14,189
the same time as I said we have less

893
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:17,219
flexibility so what is remaining right

894
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:20,930
now is to finalize the high D

895
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:24,329
computation there is some text already

896
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:29,098
regarding this thing but I believe it

897
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:33,989
needs to still be improved and I think

898
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:36,569
this is the only pending thing to do

899
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:40,049
except I mean if you receive any more

900
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:41,819
reviews we'll be more than happy to to

901
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:43,799
discuss if there are other things to

902
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:54,650
change but this is the only thing that

903
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:59,849
came over to us recorders messages

904
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:03,329
antiquity code so the ERC 32 can we use

905
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:06,660
another algorithm in laura1 we do know

906
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:08,489
that is CRC for a standard remedy but we

907
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:13,069
do have the message integrity codes

908
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:17,479
which are based on a ESC map it is it

909
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:17,479
possible to to use them

910
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,959
okay Dominique yes your question could

911
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:29,130
be twofold are you talking about

912
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:33,709
removing the Czech fragmentation or

913
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,709
implemented and implementing another

914
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:43,680
computation - for the check okay so it's

915
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:46,319
totally possible and the draft stage is

916
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,288
just in 42 with its default polynomial

917
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:52,288
is a recommended algorithm but you can

918
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:54,809
implement your own as long as usually it

919
00:54:52,289 --> 00:55:01,880
were passed in or for the purpose so

920
00:54:54,809 --> 00:55:01,880
that's that's fine thank you

921
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:09,328
so we would like to get some more

922
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:14,519
reviews of course modules are always

923
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:19,019
welcome and we believe that we should be

924
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:23,669
ready for last call before the next ITF

925
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:25,499
what is the church the process I mean if

926
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,690
there are no remaining question and

927
00:55:25,499 --> 00:55:30,089
document this table the chairs are more

928
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,859
than happy to go for walk up let's go so

929
00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:34,680
I've seen just one issue that needs to

930
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:37,410
be resolved is this longer normal

931
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,569
efforts in discussion format that's the

932
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:42,479
only discussion I've seen so once you

933
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:44,729
complete that yes we'd like to have one

934
00:55:42,479 --> 00:55:46,859
or two reviews from the room just to

935
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:50,239
make sure you know that some things are

936
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:52,949
code before I go let's go so are there

937
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:56,579
two people in this room could volunteer

938
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:59,190
to review the document judges and even

939
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:01,799
one more hand Dominique

940
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:04,380
okay so please sort out the issue

941
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:06,769
Dominique and then I will ask George us

942
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,930
and Dominique is already on it anyway

943
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:12,180
yes but for that one issue yeah but it's

944
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,609
all the rest of document so so so please

945
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:17,698
and then then yes we will do the last

946
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:20,519
column in what's holding us okay perfect

947
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:24,180
somebody on the drummer yes there's a

948
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:26,450
question from Joe is it possible to have

949
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:32,710
a stable a variable times

950
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:35,299
depending of the NTU when Sun is free

951
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:36,800
where did you become his free bytes for

952
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,829
the tile or could you make it variable

953
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:44,079
by by definition the system by

954
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:46,970
definition the tile size is the fixed

955
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,250
value that fits all I'm to use and

956
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:51,980
that's how the system was built so now I

957
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:54,920
should send you on a variable minimum

958
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:59,570
size and it's kind of meta redesigning

959
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:02,410
the protocol so know the tight side is

960
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:06,820
really this minimum constant and then

961
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:09,710
the otherwise the a corner doesn't work

962
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:17,329
are we talking about a corner by the way

963
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:21,230
so Joe and Eve you will get the link is

964
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:24,680
with unity okay so in a corner you need

965
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:27,829
to be able to resend data that was lost

966
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:30,560
and if the MTU has been reduced then you

967
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:33,020
cannot send the same message as you send

968
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:37,910
before you had to send smaller messages

969
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:40,310
and and in the new the data that shows

970
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:42,770
resending needs to fit somewhere in the

971
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:46,430
reassembly buffer and so the tile is

972
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:49,190
this minimum piece that you which you

973
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:55,879
pave the the whole reassembly buffer

974
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:58,250
that's why it's fixed and I would like

975
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,829
to rephrase what Sergio says maybe

976
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:03,650
because here you take a value of 3 for

977
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:06,440
every year on our products but if a

978
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:09,020
products is just used for in Europe then

979
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:17,990
you you take the u.s. constraint and

980
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:21,980
maybe here you can have hurt so let's

981
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:25,549
hear what to behavior saying I can we

982
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:30,920
have any views well yeah we decided that

983
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:38,359
for sanctification and also in future we

984
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:39,820
will have ice going from us Europe which

985
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:44,960
with mother

986
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:48,109
so it's already difficult to have

987
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:52,640
something changing countries we don't

988
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:57,190
want to add more complexity on that the

989
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,190
cost is a wider or bigger

990
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:05,900
but most of the time it would be

991
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:13,880
compressed so it's acceptable cost makes

992
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:20,510
sense thank you so do we have any

993
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:30,740
questions might be possible to be

994
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:33,530
negotiated a protocol set up yeah I mean

995
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:36,140
for me this might be part of the

996
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:39,140
bootstrapping if there is something we

997
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:45,009
do later maybe we should change this

998
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:47,569
behavior at that time for example yeah

999
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:49,130
you know from killing so you could also

1000
00:59:47,570 --> 01:00:00,880
define some rule like this with

1001
00:59:49,130 --> 01:00:03,980
different size we come back to the

1002
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,410
argument that maybe the implementation

1003
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:09,530
will be a little bit more complex but

1004
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:17,390
you may be it still something cool to

1005
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:21,380
consider it in the same different sizes

1006
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:23,170
but then you have the sizes or you could

1007
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:28,849
as part of the provisioning for the

1008
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:30,890
provision so those three is actually a

1009
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:36,260
must or should I mean now is it takes

1010
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:38,868
place right now it's a must I think yeah

1011
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:41,060
I think it's a must vanish you what one

1012
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:43,330
day to negotiate you to do another RFC

1013
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,740
as you will say or no it's negotiable

1014
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:48,160
but further all implementations will

1015
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:51,200
have to do three 8s would be that we get

1016
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,750
so if that's that's really what you want

1017
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:57,649
that's what you get

1018
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:59,660
okay well we might consider whether it

1019
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:03,020
makes sense to make it short or

1020
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:04,940
something but it's okay you can either

1021
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:07,280
some sentences that it might be

1022
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:10,610
overwritten by some configuration just a

1023
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:16,160
sentence like this and some out-of-band

1024
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:39,800
methods okay yeah okay thank you thank

1025
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:43,460
you okay so a very few slides to present

1026
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:49,750
two things the first one is data model I

1027
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:49,750
think it's just up to you

1028
01:01:51,490 --> 01:02:00,020
okay so the data model so to remain you

1029
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:02,839
what we have done in the in the draft is

1030
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:06,350
that we have a very abstract way to

1031
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,350
represent the rule so we never say it's

1032
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:12,860
young or we just as definite define it

1033
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:15,200
as an array and now we need to have

1034
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:17,450
something more formal for different

1035
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,790
reason first when you took Pascal talked

1036
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:22,069
before about interoperability for

1037
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:24,200
example if we want to do interpreted

1038
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:26,890
testing between two implementations so

1039
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:34,100
it's better to to have a common format

1040
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:35,930
we also may need it to two men to have

1041
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,630
some management it means that for

1042
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:41,240
example the device can change some

1043
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,760
parameter in the Schick controller a

1044
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:48,649
compressor we talked about the tie sighs

1045
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:52,750
maybe it's opportunity to do this and

1046
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:53,900
extra saw so we need something that is

1047
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,230
smaller

1048
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:59,510
another example is Christian but say

1049
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:01,970
that maybe we can do ash

1050
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:03,950
the rule to be sure when for security

1051
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:06,680
reason that we are using the same rule

1052
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:08,750
and of course if we do a hash we need at

1053
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,750
the two end of the same similar

1054
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:15,350
presentation so we have to study a way

1055
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:17,170
to represent in a compact way because we

1056
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:20,240
are in compact device in an easy way

1057
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:23,240
this information that's why we are going

1058
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:26,450
to investigate young model to see if it

1059
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:30,500
fits all the requirement we need for

1060
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:34,339
this this management so we have already

1061
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:36,530
a draft but will expire soon but present

1062
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:39,320
to first young model

1063
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:43,310
lastly ITF I presented also something

1064
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:46,210
that was more evolved on envision model

1065
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:49,820
but we are reaching our limits in

1066
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:53,540
annyeong so that's why we we asked the

1067
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:56,660
idea we the chair to see if we can have

1068
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:59,630
contact with the young doctor to see if

1069
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:03,020
we are starting well and we don't make

1070
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:06,890
some big mistakes that will appear in

1071
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:09,620
the future as a restriction so you saw

1072
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:11,660
my request to the management ad a couple

1073
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,700
of weeks ago for a young doctor slot I

1074
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:15,230
really hoped like you would have a young

1075
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,810
doctor assigned to us by now but

1076
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:21,050
unfortunately it didn't happen so just

1077
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:24,860
keep looking at it to get something done

1078
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:26,900
and so if nothing happens I'll probably

1079
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:29,840
talk to the secretary of the again it's

1080
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,870
Mehmet so I'll probably try and see if I

1081
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:37,400
can get a response the end or Chris

1082
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:40,339
directly okay thank you so this is a

1083
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:43,280
physical point so we will shoot soon a

1084
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:46,910
new version of a young model and this

1085
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,640
one can be the base for discussion the

1086
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:52,879
other point that comes from during the

1087
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:56,600
last call with core working group so we

1088
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:59,270
had a proposal from Caston that say that

1089
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:04,460
we for example we have co-op option and

1090
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:10,700
for the moment we define in LP one a

1091
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:12,410
name for each co-op options so for the

1092
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,270
moment it's okay because it's

1093
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:17,299
think that is internal to an application

1094
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:20,540
but when we will go to that young model

1095
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:23,690
of course we don't want to make twice

1096
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:26,360
the work on a core is defining some

1097
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:29,690
co-op option and then LP one we have to

1098
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:32,750
redefine another space for visco up

1099
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:36,050
option so one proposal but we have to

1100
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:39,110
discuss it is for example to reserve in

1101
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:43,010
the seed space that represent all the

1102
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:48,110
value we are manipulating in in shake so

1103
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:50,780
some space for the co-op option and for

1104
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:54,850
example here when we will have us ure

1105
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:58,970
profits value 11 so it will be the 11th

1106
01:05:54,850 --> 01:06:02,060
place in this space on Exeter Xterra so

1107
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:04,459
when core we create new co-op option

1108
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,770
then automatically it will be present

1109
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,620
here and we don't have to do any

1110
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:13,870
translation currently the drawback of

1111
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:17,600
this is that we have to to take a 65

1112
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:20,900
thousand places just for the seed space

1113
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:23,420
which can be a lot so I don't know if

1114
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,460
it's reasonably or not to do that

1115
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:29,090
because the seed space can be very very

1116
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:33,200
huge so it's a possibility so do we have

1117
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:36,380
to do it for co-op option do we have to

1118
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:39,169
do it for over value but we will find on

1119
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:41,300
protocol we we compress so currently

1120
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:45,680
that's an open question and I would like

1121
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:48,140
to have your opinion on it you don't

1122
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:52,250
need to reserve the 65,000 you can

1123
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:54,200
really pick 16,000 or even less and then

1124
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,510
you will have a continuation code and

1125
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,730
you will pick a different range later so

1126
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:00,440
it's not obliged to take the 65,000

1127
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:08,150
right now so you can take this approach

1128
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:12,140
with no right now I think you can have

1129
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:14,080
up to 1000 seats in one talk but if you

1130
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:19,190
decide to go this way maybe we can

1131
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:21,310
change this or just just invent the

1132
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:25,600
continuation code like if you see almost

1133
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:25,600
1,000 it means go somewhere else

1134
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:34,220
just-just you'll have more wrenches with

1135
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:36,680
trenches of coop tons of ways of doing

1136
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:53,980
it without booking the 65,000 I'm sure

1137
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:53,980
you so the next presenter will be me

1138
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:16,519
okay so this is a result of we had the

1139
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:19,429
working group last call on the coop

1140
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:22,670
compression it was also sent to the core

1141
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:25,310
working group to have their feedback so

1142
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:29,799
here is a result of this curve so we

1143
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:35,270
move from now we are in version 9 of the

1144
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:39,890
so we have comments from both groups

1145
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:43,100
about what we are doing in this document

1146
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:45,350
so thank you for all the reviewer we are

1147
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:50,239
also coming from Christian but we took

1148
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:53,569
this week so it's not here it's about to

1149
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:56,089
make a rash of the rules the context in

1150
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:59,089
both sides when you are doing Oscar and

1151
01:08:56,089 --> 01:09:02,149
include this ash in the ad when you are

1152
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:04,969
doing the encryption so this way you are

1153
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:08,719
sure that both devices or the device and

1154
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:10,790
the Chico are using the same rules for

1155
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,730
the compression so it's avoid to have

1156
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:16,460
confusion if for example you you could

1157
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:18,649
get into a deal anis understand as a

1158
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:22,839
debit and of course you you will have

1159
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:26,120
some bad behavior so that's something we

1160
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:28,519
have also to include so from my point of

1161
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:31,759
view it's quite difficult right now to

1162
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,799
push it because we need this data model

1163
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,738
before doing it because of course if

1164
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:39,290
both side user jizan the

1165
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:41,479
and you have one space in one J'son

1166
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:43,880
definition and those space in the other

1167
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:47,179
one so the ash will be different and it

1168
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:49,040
would be difficult to to manage so it's

1169
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,380
something interesting but how to

1170
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:59,300
integrate it right now I don't see

1171
01:09:51,380 --> 01:10:04,180
really how to do it you want so in v8 we

1172
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:08,780
we have only some text edition so

1173
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:11,870
nothing new and in v9 we introduce or

1174
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:15,139
see also command from the co-working

1175
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:18,559
group it was about ossification on the

1176
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:22,310
risk to say okay I am compressing this

1177
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,650
way and then the coop protocol will not

1178
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:26,840
evolve anymore because we have defined

1179
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:29,059
it's version 1 or we have a rule that

1180
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,510
say we have this and this and listen if

1181
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:35,989
something new appears in in a co-working

1182
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:39,140
group when it it will maybe block by the

1183
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:41,660
fact that she cannot evolve so this is

1184
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,489
something that is not really a problem

1185
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:46,070
from the ship point of view because she

1186
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:49,629
is very generic and when the device

1187
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:52,219
evolve then the rule with evolve and if

1188
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:54,380
when everything is designed as a field

1189
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:57,440
we have a way to compress it to

1190
01:10:54,380 --> 01:11:00,560
manipulate it so is not reader problem

1191
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:03,830
but we had some text to say that there

1192
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:09,440
is no risk of ossification with leaf

1193
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:13,910
Shiki ok so here is what I say before

1194
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:16,669
with custom remark is what puts co-op

1195
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:19,219
space into into shake so this way you

1196
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:23,590
don't have trouble and I cover this

1197
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:27,080
point with the data model and so we

1198
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:29,630
finished with walking or sass call all

1199
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,360
the ticket has been closed and we answer

1200
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:34,670
all the questions so now I turn to the

1201
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:37,040
chance what's the next step well the

1202
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:41,450
next step is to find a Shepherd so

1203
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:43,190
probably elack's but otherwise we might

1204
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:44,660
I mean if somebody is interested in in

1205
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:46,339
trying the exercise of being the

1206
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,320
Shepherd of this document we can help

1207
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,490
that person through the process to

1208
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,549
solutes

1209
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:54,830
interesting learning curve so always

1210
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:58,910
open the Shepherd is not named right now

1211
01:11:54,830 --> 01:12:07,370
so but if I appear to take around years

1212
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:08,750
if anybody wants to try the game you

1213
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:17,809
want to try to be a shepherd

1214
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:24,830
I will excuse roads it's not I have been

1215
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:27,860
shepherding I might have a little bit

1216
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:32,809
more locked on cozy but that I you see

1217
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:40,610
and if I have time for this come back to

1218
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:42,530
Alex and me yes are you sure I can fix

1219
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:44,420
somebody like you so I'll just like look

1220
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,070
for somebody in like probably even

1221
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:49,880
outside the group to just do it just to

1222
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:51,410
okay please I mean because it's open I

1223
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:57,920
mean I like to have new eyes basically

1224
01:12:51,410 --> 01:13:13,880
that gives us an additional review and

1225
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:15,920
show scrutiny it's always good quick

1226
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,800
comment from Alexander pillow perfect

1227
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:25,529
thanks to that

1228
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:25,529
[Music]

1229
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:50,269
hello again this is an update on the OEM

1230
01:13:42,989 --> 01:13:55,468
draft so the purpose of this draft is to

1231
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:59,310
discuss the OEM methods and protocols

1232
01:13:55,469 --> 01:14:01,199
for IOT II in the context of shake so we

1233
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:04,739
want to start with really simple stuff

1234
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:08,580
things that people do expect when they

1235
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:10,290
have IP connectivity so they expect ICMP

1236
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:13,590
error messages when something goes wrong

1237
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:16,199
along the path the one who they want to

1238
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:20,360
be able to ping the destination and

1239
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:26,250
maybe run a traceroute to troubleshoot

1240
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:28,889
initial problems and we want to discuss

1241
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:30,199
what and define what we want to do in

1242
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:35,070
the context of IOT

1243
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:37,980
does that all make sense you know how do

1244
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:42,809
we all know that in first - keep it

1245
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:46,889
simple we want to address the methods

1246
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:51,510
and messages in RC 44-43 and not the

1247
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:53,610
extended stuff so this is a come to a

1248
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:55,980
question shortly this is a kind of

1249
01:14:53,610 --> 01:15:01,429
scenarios we considered so this is

1250
01:14:55,980 --> 01:15:03,718
already a year all oops wrong button

1251
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:05,760
obviously from the internet if you have

1252
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:09,150
IP connectivity people want to as I said

1253
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,400
Kathy ICMP a v6 or message bags want to

1254
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:15,870
be able to do a ping a trace valve so

1255
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:18,690
what do we do if the the problem happens

1256
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:21,390
somewhere here on the everyone

1257
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:23,879
what kind of respond do we send back do

1258
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:26,510
we want to propagate those into the lp1

1259
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:30,000
network or not is it safe is it

1260
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:33,989
reasonable etc and also on DL in the

1261
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,179
other way probably we want an ICMP v6

1262
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:39,330
error message back from the device if it

1263
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:41,850
sends an ipv6 message but we don't

1264
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:44,370
explain the device to run a traceroute

1265
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:46,770
because it says nobody just no keyboard

1266
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:49,260
whatever so this is probably not

1267
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:51,179
something we want to consider a thing

1268
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,819
might be something realistic for a

1269
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:55,789
device to do

1270
01:15:52,819 --> 01:16:00,399
so this raft is first discussing the use

1271
01:15:55,789 --> 01:16:04,969
cases and then providing solutions

1272
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:08,329
Chilean here on today you answered my

1273
01:16:04,969 --> 01:16:11,539
question jr. from killing random dress

1274
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:14,709
is it in reading useful to run tres tres

1275
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:16,999
roads in lp1

1276
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:21,289
architecture because the last office

1277
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:23,510
should be none or is this actually

1278
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:30,259
adding that and political device

1279
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:31,939
identities that you Angela okay once we

1280
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:34,760
can imagine our sewage at the traceroute

1281
01:16:31,939 --> 01:16:36,919
stop at compressor and you have a

1282
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:39,319
specific message versus three after

1283
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:40,879
about thirty one network so that could

1284
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:43,149
be interesting that could be a security

1285
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:43,149
issue

1286
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,619
yeah it's really a discussion written by

1287
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:50,568
no means to II think we have the

1288
01:16:48,619 --> 01:17:00,409
definite answer to our discussion so

1289
01:16:50,569 --> 01:17:02,780
it's really debated in static bridge so

1290
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:05,379
since Pascal two layers and individual

1291
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:09,259
contributor since you've mentioned

1292
01:17:05,379 --> 01:17:10,849
Europe I sit here I know where so it's

1293
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:13,609
like your honor I'm aware of like

1294
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:15,499
yahuwah by code indicate why it's not

1295
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:19,879
read the context of shake or all in one

1296
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:22,398
but similar it's cold in something like

1297
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:24,949
the gateway would actually offload the

1298
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:28,010
or processing from the device and we

1299
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:30,469
secrete generators in paris on behind

1300
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:33,429
effective device that can be Mecca file

1301
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:48,429
since any logical function like back but

1302
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:48,429
do that okay so say sorry P on this okay

1303
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:55,308
I'm Bob mosque which I'm looking at your

1304
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:58,568
slide there are only intended it of this

1305
01:17:55,309 --> 01:18:03,470
and type of the top hearing you know

1306
01:17:58,569 --> 01:18:07,760
ipv6 on the top and icmpv6 underneath

1307
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:10,280
is there some cific some intimation of

1308
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:16,130
why the directions are named differently

1309
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:20,480
or is it yeah we're creaming to describe

1310
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:23,000
here is scenario so we're saying we

1311
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:25,549
think it would be interesting for a

1312
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,480
device when they send an ipv6 message

1313
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:31,340
out and there's some issue with his ipv6

1314
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:35,179
message in the network that they are

1315
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:39,170
able to achieve the icmpv6 our message

1316
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:43,340
back and conversely on the other side

1317
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:46,820
but definitely we have ipv6 flowing both

1318
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:49,370
ways and icmpv6 flowing both ways but

1319
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:56,360
this is a scenario on the device side

1320
01:18:49,370 --> 01:19:00,500
and scenario okay that's why the the top

1321
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:04,040
comes with it thank you for the comment

1322
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:06,320
anyway so we haven't honestly we're

1323
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:09,710
having worked at all on this since last

1324
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:17,750
meeting how except for this hackathon

1325
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:20,480
where I roll implemented this part so we

1326
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:24,530
got the code into the the Chicot on this

1327
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:27,950
side and when we said ping from the

1328
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:30,590
internet then the shakur instead of

1329
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,269
forwarding the ping and compressing it

1330
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:38,660
and forwarding to the device will

1331
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:41,720
respond with an echo reply on behalf of

1332
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:45,320
the device and the way we did it which

1333
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:47,180
is interesting is kind of reuse the the

1334
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:51,410
compressor implementation which has a

1335
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:54,170
matching thought we look at ROS and we

1336
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:56,000
have a matching pattern and then we

1337
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:58,670
apply it for compression and then we

1338
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,520
added a few hooks such that when this

1339
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:05,450
matching part matches then we call a

1340
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,080
special code that sends I echo reply

1341
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:09,599
back

1342
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:17,280
so just a point of reference we have

1343
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:19,140
some of this working so that use case is

1344
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,969
it going to be something to make sure

1345
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:23,480
that the end device is actually alive

1346
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:26,490
before replying with a ping back to do

1347
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:28,799
because otherwise you're not making sure

1348
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:31,410
that they will respond with a finger

1349
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,240
right that's a very valid question it's

1350
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:35,250
all part of the discussion that needs to

1351
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,309
take place in and it revives this

1352
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:39,210
discussion is what do we want to do what

1353
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:42,450
do we expect

1354
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:46,590
certainly not responding to the pin ping

1355
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:49,320
at all is probably a bad idea in general

1356
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:52,530
because people expect that you know they

1357
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:55,559
have an ipv6 device and they have some

1358
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:58,440
host with an ipv6 address expect to get

1359
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:01,860
someone so back to the pin but what can

1360
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:05,580
of answer do we want to send how long as

1361
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:09,179
the device been I mean how far back has

1362
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:11,250
a device been seen for us to decide that

1363
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,740
we want to send a reply I don't know

1364
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:15,390
could be an hour could be a day very

1365
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:17,700
much depends on the network on a class

1366
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:19,980
of device if it's Class A Class C of

1367
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:22,920
course is if it's Laura one person you

1368
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:25,559
expected expect an immediate answer back

1369
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:29,550
if its class here you understand that it

1370
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:32,390
may be sleeping you know four hours in a

1371
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:44,460
row so it's all part of the discussion

1372
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:46,980
on the opening question and if you don't

1373
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,830
see any traffic so you don't answer so

1374
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:53,040
this way this management tool you can

1375
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:55,230
see if your device is active it's

1376
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,830
simulating the liveliness of the device

1377
01:21:55,230 --> 01:22:07,019
and you know repeat five minutes just

1378
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:09,360
for running the test but okay so next

1379
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:11,310
steps unchanged from last time discuss

1380
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:14,940
the use cases on the mailing list I will

1381
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:17,370
revive this discussion definitely is

1382
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,839
there some other useful Orion stuffs

1383
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:22,559
that we want to do in the

1384
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:29,610
take vo t and l t1 and then implement

1385
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:31,670
and play with this stuff okay no more

1386
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:31,670
questions

1387
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:36,789
[Music]

1388
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:53,850
[Music]

1389
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:05,309
okay hello everyone my name is Carlos

1390
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,900
Gomez and I'm going to present an update

1391
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:11,460
of the draft and title RTO

1392
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:13,440
considerations in lp1 so first of all a

1393
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:17,040
reminder on the motivation for this

1394
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:19,860
document we have that in many lp1

1395
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,460
scenarios we have longer build on our

1396
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,980
titties

1397
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,750
in ideal scenarios we may have our

1398
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:27,179
titties already in the order of seconds

1399
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:29,310
or tens of seconds and due to a number

1400
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:31,410
of phenomena we may also have higher

1401
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:34,950
order our titties with values up to

1402
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:37,050
several minutes or even more so as a

1403
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:39,330
consequence the rtt nlp-1

1404
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:41,670
and also that the variant of the RTT is

1405
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:44,760
much greater than the typical one on the

1406
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:47,580
internet for comparison the default RTO

1407
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:49,470
in TCP is currently one second and the

1408
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:52,710
default Artyom coop is randomly chosen

1409
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:55,230
between two and three seconds so we have

1410
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:58,680
these particular RTD characteristics in

1411
01:23:55,230 --> 01:24:02,580
LP ones however we also have returns

1412
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:05,580
mission timers for example when we use

1413
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:06,870
coop in LP one and we send a con message

1414
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:11,370
there will be a retransmission timer

1415
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:13,519
running and also she defines two modes I

1416
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:16,230
call ways and I can read that use

1417
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,970
retransmission time as well so the

1418
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:20,669
question here is okay how do we deal

1419
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:25,440
with these particular characteristics of

1420
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:27,720
our titties in LP one so the status of

1421
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,639
the document is as follows the initial

1422
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:33,840
version of the draft was presented in

1423
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:35,370
Prak it contained an analysis of what we

1424
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,160
now call the uplink

1425
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:40,050
RTD this is a round trip where the first

1426
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:42,360
message is in the airplane the the

1427
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:45,300
response comes in the downlink and also

1428
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:49,080
it contained proposal for an algorithm

1429
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:51,870
for the RTO and in this update we have

1430
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:53,220
added this terminology of a planar t

1431
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:55,530
teardown linearity

1432
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:58,320
by the way the latter is the opposite so

1433
01:24:55,530 --> 01:25:00,420
the first packet is in the downlink in

1434
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:03,599
that case and also we've added a

1435
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:06,120
downlink RTD analysis also in this

1436
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,829
presentation I'll show an example of

1437
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:11,219
some preliminary evaluation whose

1438
01:25:07,829 --> 01:25:15,780
the proposed RTO algorithm obtained by

1439
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:18,599
simulation so regarding the downing RTD

1440
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:21,089
analysis we can identify that it

1441
01:25:18,599 --> 01:25:23,159
comprises two components the first one

1442
01:25:21,089 --> 01:25:26,599
is the wait time until the next uplink

1443
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:29,459
transmission and this is because in

1444
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:33,359
technology such as sick fox or Laurel

1445
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:37,648
one plus a a downlink packet can only be

1446
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:39,719
sent in a dedicated time window that has

1447
01:25:37,649 --> 01:25:42,449
been offered as a result of a previous

1448
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:44,999
uplink transmission therefore this this

1449
01:25:42,449 --> 01:25:47,638
component this wait time will depend on

1450
01:25:44,999 --> 01:25:50,369
the application and it might take values

1451
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:53,639
such as in the order of seconds minutes

1452
01:25:50,369 --> 01:25:55,919
hours although it's true that there are

1453
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:58,079
also some special cases where if we know

1454
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:59,459
in advance that we want to perform when

1455
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:01,619
do we want to perform a downlink

1456
01:25:59,459 --> 01:26:04,438
transmission it would be possible also

1457
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:06,179
to program beforehand some bling

1458
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:08,999
transmission so that it might be

1459
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:11,999
possible to minimize this component

1460
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:13,889
ideally even down to zero and then the

1461
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:16,499
second component in the downing RT team

1462
01:26:13,889 --> 01:26:20,129
would be the time since the uplink has

1463
01:26:16,499 --> 01:26:22,469
been completed until the whole darling

1464
01:26:20,129 --> 01:26:27,499
RTD has been completed and we call this

1465
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:27,499
second component a basic darling RT

1466
01:26:31,849 --> 01:26:44,780
which I understand well this is plus a

1467
01:26:47,329 --> 01:26:58,409
yes so these numbers are only for the

1468
01:26:50,489 --> 01:27:02,999
second component yes so this is after

1469
01:26:58,409 --> 01:27:07,138
the uplink has been done yeah so we have

1470
01:27:02,999 --> 01:27:08,760
other theoretical analysis similar to

1471
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,559
the one that already existed in the

1472
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,599
document that was for the Appling RTD

1473
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:16,019
now we have added these numbers which

1474
01:27:12,599 --> 01:27:18,839
correspond to basic down leaner tt for

1475
01:27:16,019 --> 01:27:21,330
lor 1 plus a and also for sig folks for

1476
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:24,600
a variety of well data rates and

1477
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:26,670
Appling mid rates respectively and the

1478
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:29,520
conclusion is similar to the one that we

1479
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:31,980
identified for the appli- values which

1480
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,260
is that in many cases we have RTS which

1481
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:39,389
are already greater than the default

1482
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:42,690
co-op RTO then in the document there's

1483
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:46,980
also discussion of approaches for the

1484
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:48,629
RTO so in perhaps in some cases delay

1485
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:51,540
might not be relevant for the

1486
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:54,270
implication so in that case what one can

1487
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:56,580
do is to set the RTO to the highest

1488
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:58,770
expected RTD in order to avoid spurious

1489
01:27:56,580 --> 01:28:01,290
retries and that's it

1490
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:02,340
however if delay is actually relevant

1491
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:05,540
for the application

1492
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:08,160
meaning that it makes a difference to

1493
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:11,580
retry after one second compared to

1494
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:13,860
retrying after 100 seconds and also if

1495
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:16,530
we expect to find higher-order are

1496
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:19,200
titties in our scenario then we might

1497
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:21,389
consider using an algorithm such as the

1498
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:26,550
one that's presented here we call it

1499
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:30,270
dual RTO algorithm and it is basically a

1500
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:33,720
two-state machine where there's two

1501
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:37,080
separate RT log rhythms used there is

1502
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:39,510
the high RTO state which uses one RT

1503
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:41,400
algorithm which is initialized to values

1504
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:43,500
that are compatible with higher titties

1505
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,540
then there's a lower T or state which

1506
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:48,750
uses a separate RT algorithm which is

1507
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:50,850
consistent with lower TD values so for

1508
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:54,030
example if we are in the hierarchy of

1509
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:56,580
state and then we obtain a number of

1510
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:59,219
consecutive lower TT samples then the

1511
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:01,830
mechanism switches to using the low RTO

1512
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:06,120
algorithm and vice-versa

1513
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:09,140
in the other case so this is just an

1514
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:14,250
example to illustrate what we could get

1515
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:18,860
when we compare what happens if we are

1516
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:23,280
using a standard single TCP RTL which

1517
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:26,160
corresponds to the curve in red here in

1518
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:29,059
this figure we show the RTL values

1519
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:31,050
produced by this standard TCP RTL

1520
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:33,239
compared with the ones that will be

1521
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:35,639
produced by the dual RTO

1522
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:38,369
rhythm which are the ones in green when

1523
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:40,499
there's as an input the sequence of RTD

1524
01:29:38,369 --> 01:29:43,469
values that are shown in blue in the

1525
01:29:40,499 --> 01:29:46,289
figure as you can see this sequence in

1526
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:49,170
this example is basically that RT DS are

1527
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:50,880
by default low like around one second

1528
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:53,460
and then there are a couple of intervals

1529
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:57,360
in which the RT T's are around 100

1530
01:29:53,460 --> 01:30:01,559
seconds and we can observe that the TCP

1531
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:04,049
RTL so if you use a single RTO here it

1532
01:30:01,559 --> 01:30:06,360
struggles with the variance of the RTD

1533
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:10,769
that's the result of the change of the

1534
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:14,639
RTT state and the tcp RTO produces very

1535
01:30:10,769 --> 01:30:16,739
large values even up to 300 seconds you

1536
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:22,039
can see also that it takes some time to

1537
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:25,169
converge for the single TCP RTO and also

1538
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:27,659
the worst case is when the RTT is

1539
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:30,150
already in one second and meanwhile

1540
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:33,360
during this conversions phase after a

1541
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:36,598
transition of the RTD values the TCG RTO

1542
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:40,440
is stained with values of 300 200 100

1543
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:43,380
seconds in contrast with the dual RTO as

1544
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:46,558
soon as there's the detection of change

1545
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:50,849
of the RTD State it switches to the

1546
01:30:46,559 --> 01:30:52,199
appropriate RTO algorithm by the way in

1547
01:30:50,849 --> 01:30:55,880
this simulation what we use is to

1548
01:30:52,199 --> 01:30:58,079
separate TCP rtos however one is

1549
01:30:55,880 --> 01:31:00,840
initialized to values compatible with

1550
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:03,420
high art it is the other one is suitable

1551
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:07,050
for low art it is and as you can see the

1552
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:10,460
dual RTO is able to follow the RTT much

1553
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:15,900
closer than the tcp RTO

1554
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:17,639
so one consideration here is that it is

1555
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:20,460
actually possible or that's the

1556
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:22,889
assumption to know a priori in advance

1557
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:27,510
which will be the higher T T values for

1558
01:31:22,889 --> 01:31:29,940
example if the high art ET intervals are

1559
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:32,280
due to packets being buffered in a

1560
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:34,440
gateway that then can only be sent

1561
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,809
because of some uplink transmission that

1562
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,789
allows that downlink transmission then

1563
01:31:36,809 --> 01:31:41,280
it means that the RTT is actually

1564
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:42,379
related it depends with the time between

1565
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,539
public message

1566
01:31:42,379 --> 01:31:45,829
also another observation is that the

1567
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:47,239
amount of improvement that can be

1568
01:31:45,829 --> 01:31:49,188
achieved will depend on the actual

1569
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:54,619
statistics for example the duration of

1570
01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:57,139
the high or low RTD intervals so well

1571
01:31:54,619 --> 01:32:00,438
this was just an example and well there

1572
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:02,719
are some questions for the group and one

1573
01:32:00,439 --> 01:32:06,530
is okay is there interest in this work

1574
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:08,269
and then if yes then there's a related

1575
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:10,509
question which is okay this document

1576
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:14,389
contains somewhat hybrid content like

1577
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:16,609
informational content about settings for

1578
01:32:14,389 --> 01:32:19,399
the RTO but also then also an

1579
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:21,979
experimental kind of algorithm for the

1580
01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:28,519
RTL and also connected with transport

1581
01:32:21,979 --> 01:32:30,019
area stuff so what do you think so my

1582
01:32:28,519 --> 01:32:33,349
feeling is that we have a cross layer

1583
01:32:30,019 --> 01:32:36,859
issue that's the main thing which is

1584
01:32:33,349 --> 01:32:38,929
like basically you kept this timeout but

1585
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:41,719
authorities at the Italia which says a

1586
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:43,369
probably my message was not received and

1587
01:32:41,719 --> 01:32:45,109
this is good that might be an utterly

1588
01:32:43,369 --> 01:32:48,169
acknowledgements sitting on the Gateway

1589
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:50,149
but your promise deployed there is

1590
01:32:48,169 --> 01:32:52,969
chicken leg between finding out and

1591
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:55,399
device and message because if you turn

1592
01:32:52,969 --> 01:32:58,340
out to send a message we'll pull it but

1593
01:32:55,399 --> 01:33:00,499
then it will also give information to

1594
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:02,719
the other side that something was lost

1595
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:04,938
which is not the case so because it's

1596
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,309
just waiting for you on the Gateway so

1597
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:09,800
so we are missing this this interface

1598
01:33:07,309 --> 01:33:12,859
between yeah probably when I transport

1599
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:15,349
or occupation above co-op well by the

1600
01:33:12,859 --> 01:33:17,840
transport application when it turns out

1601
01:33:15,349 --> 01:33:21,979
instead of creating a real application

1602
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:24,320
in the development when it's it what you

1603
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:26,570
will retry whatever first that's

1604
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:29,478
something which has a result of pulling

1605
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:32,058
stuff and then if that doesn't work then

1606
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:33,649
we will timeout caliper but I think we

1607
01:33:32,059 --> 01:33:37,070
need to describe that model because it's

1608
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:38,989
pretty new to to the model well you need

1609
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:41,299
a message me up to message that doesn't

1610
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:44,119
go further than the Gateway to just try

1611
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:46,789
and teach it so that's the first thing I

1612
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:48,530
need to calculate that now the second

1613
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:50,809
thing I have is no I don't believe that

1614
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:53,179
you can without any cost layer

1615
01:33:50,809 --> 01:33:56,249
interaction like that that you can tell

1616
01:33:53,179 --> 01:33:59,400
what the bounded value is for the

1617
01:33:56,249 --> 01:34:01,499
because the query will tell you that if

1618
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:04,228
you get more message from the network

1619
01:34:01,499 --> 01:34:06,780
into the gate wake you know you get them

1620
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:09,479
faster than that you program but that

1621
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:12,300
chicken become internet right in theory

1622
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:13,260
so so it's a quiz infinitum it's being

1623
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:15,119
an addendum

1624
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:17,969
I'm cheetah the speed at which you pull

1625
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:20,009
it then killed on the uphill can go into

1626
01:34:17,969 --> 01:34:22,289
it as well so we must have some methods

1627
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:26,369
to control the size of the queue on the

1628
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:36,420
gateway escort so so bigger scheme in

1629
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:38,579
which this thing whirls described until

1630
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:42,119
now we have already we have taken the

1631
01:34:38,579 --> 01:34:44,610
device as a device that we know but I

1632
01:34:42,119 --> 01:34:48,360
think you know t1 networks a device is

1633
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:51,089
quite different not only have added

1634
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:54,808
different entities each sentence

1635
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:59,869
differently it's a symmetric timers have

1636
01:34:54,809 --> 01:34:59,869
different so the response is different

1637
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:10,950
[Music]

1638
01:35:11,420 --> 01:36:01,739
so I need some new configuration

1639
01:35:55,789 --> 01:36:03,030
compared to these lp1 networks thank you

1640
01:36:01,739 --> 01:36:05,940
I understand that

1641
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:08,099
next up would be trying to identify like

1642
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:09,190
which are which is the the set of

1643
01:36:08,099 --> 01:36:12,460
parameters

1644
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:14,950
perhaps not only RTT as you say - my man

1645
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:16,840
comes for example inactivity timers may

1646
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:20,320
also have some dependencies some

1647
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:22,540
relationship with this content and yes

1648
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,059
from there we might be able to see if it

1649
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:27,580
makes sense to to consider set of

1650
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:29,650
parameters performance parameters or

1651
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:32,650
behavior parameters in the same document

1652
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:41,740
or perhaps if there's some different

1653
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:45,250
nature like studied them separately yes

1654
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:47,410
also Chariton I would really welcome a

1655
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:49,840
prime statement document which explains

1656
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:52,960
what that implication of this pool model

1657
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:55,330
on the upper layers like like TCP or

1658
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,850
whatever application of a co-op once we

1659
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:59,440
understand what the primes are then we

1660
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:03,130
can look at solutions like this right

1661
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,299
but we need a greater context so the

1662
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:06,490
first thing is probably to write this

1663
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:11,350
problem statement and yes I would

1664
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:13,179
welcome that beautiful stone did you

1665
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:25,900
consider Marcos modeling for this

1666
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:27,900
program I'm not yet but it's very

1667
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:30,549
important because we've Sheik we are ID

1668
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:35,009
the fact that we are behind an empty one

1669
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:44,110
network so we have to adapt a server

1670
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:46,690
very important to us thank you thank you

1671
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:48,759
calles do we have any more discussion on

1672
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:51,549
this topic means probably one of our

1673
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:55,480
more critical topics to discuss with in

1674
01:37:51,550 --> 01:38:00,040
the future so nothing ok so the last

1675
01:37:55,480 --> 01:38:03,610
topic probably Suresh is the rich

1676
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:05,560
offering games so I do not for again the

1677
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:09,670
slides which we presented them a number

1678
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:12,370
of times I can we just need to point on

1679
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:17,410
I ATF 101 instead of H and 105 from the

1680
01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:19,890
data tracker so basically the bottom

1681
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:22,949
line is we are we have split the first

1682
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:25,709
item of the agenda into

1683
01:38:22,949 --> 01:38:29,280
what is complete which is the mention

1684
01:38:25,709 --> 01:38:31,469
document what is well on the way which

1685
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:33,690
is the chic of the full document which

1686
01:38:31,469 --> 01:38:38,429
should adapt the she profiles for the

1687
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:41,999
particular technologies and then the

1688
01:38:38,429 --> 01:38:46,229
chic profile itself which will be the

1689
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:50,969
young model that we have now and so suit

1690
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:53,340
up basically the three main items and we

1691
01:38:50,969 --> 01:38:58,260
have added a new item in the proposed

1692
01:38:53,340 --> 01:39:01,019
charter for what has become the the ICMP

1693
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:05,070
OAM draft right so this is pretty much

1694
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:06,959
what we are asking so rush how do you

1695
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:09,090
see you next faced with it looks you

1696
01:39:06,959 --> 01:39:12,709
know we have documents for this as data

1697
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:12,709
items we are very good shape already

1698
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:25,019
presented HF 101 it's not change just

1699
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:27,329
like put the Chapman and sell it to me

1700
01:39:25,019 --> 01:39:30,150
I'll put it inside the rechecking

1701
01:39:27,329 --> 01:39:33,239
process in the IAC I just wanna wait

1702
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:35,638
till the sig document is done with the

1703
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:37,379
ESG so that's like I think 22nd or

1704
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:39,479
something and then she called the text

1705
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:41,550
to me I'll put in a new version of

1706
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,380
Charter and this like part of the steps

1707
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:45,300
to go through so I need to do like an

1708
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:47,309
informal review an internal review and

1709
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:50,459
an Excel each of them is about like two

1710
01:39:47,309 --> 01:39:52,320
weeks not six weeks one time we've been

1711
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:55,229
working for one year plus on the chata

1712
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:57,389
items anyway it's just it's just that so

1713
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:59,909
the discussion to of today about this

1714
01:39:57,389 --> 01:40:01,949
FTO and Crossley your issues due to the

1715
01:39:59,909 --> 01:40:05,579
pull model no you have to send a message

1716
01:40:01,949 --> 01:40:07,709
to get a message back the more and more

1717
01:40:05,579 --> 01:40:10,199
we talk about it the more it seems like

1718
01:40:07,709 --> 01:40:12,809
it's an important topic for us so should

1719
01:40:10,199 --> 01:40:15,539
we modify that shorter as you've seen it

1720
01:40:12,809 --> 01:40:17,219
since last year or two twelve topic like

1721
01:40:15,539 --> 01:40:25,349
this problem statement to start with I

1722
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:27,300
think is it enough interested in doing

1723
01:40:25,349 --> 01:40:29,909
it and then the a conscience is just

1724
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,249
everything okay okay so we go so many

1725
01:40:29,909 --> 01:40:34,469
lists ask if we have interest in this

1726
01:40:32,249 --> 01:40:36,360
broad segment and I guess the actual

1727
01:40:34,469 --> 01:40:36,720
discussion will come naturally out of

1728
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,790
the

1729
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:42,480
work and then we shot operative no

1730
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:44,970
people are ready for it okay and that

1731
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:46,679
allows a little the deliverables right

1732
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:51,590
so I have a mind stone for it and so on

1733
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:53,970
if it's missed your put the chapter the

1734
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:55,920
ETSU go gone but also had a deliverable

1735
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:57,210
so it if it's just a problem statement

1736
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,480
or you want to work on future and so on

1737
01:40:57,210 --> 01:41:01,440
right so that's kind of like make them

1738
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:03,389
little bows because like lot of the

1739
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,620
times and people are saying okay what do

1740
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:07,080
you want to deliver that's not like

1741
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:08,849
society keep those two separate because

1742
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,620
like one of them we can change easier

1743
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:14,490
than the other so make sure it's in the

1744
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:16,410
Charter and so I mean question to the

1745
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:18,360
room right now right to be put the prime

1746
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:20,370
statements an obvious one that we

1747
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:22,170
already put the RTO in the new Charter

1748
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:24,030
is it something I mean I would like to

1749
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:26,070
get the purse of the robe I mean are we

1750
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:28,050
ready to work on the FTO already does it

1751
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:30,179
make sense for everybody please if you

1752
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:32,070
think we should shop include ear to your

1753
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:38,040
discussion guys presented in the next

1754
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:42,030
charter please harm I repeat because the

1755
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:45,930
harm was light if you think business and

1756
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:53,429
wake up no I just want to make sure

1757
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:55,230
because I see please listen if you if

1758
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:56,550
you care about the after your work in

1759
01:41:55,230 --> 01:42:02,129
these working groups so we already

1760
01:41:56,550 --> 01:42:03,690
include it in the chapter please hum if

1761
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:07,470
you don't think this group should work

1762
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:21,330
on out your problems please have but the

1763
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:25,580
train doesn't want to occur this is a

1764
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:31,710
nagging and Harwell work in a world

1765
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:36,680
language and worship I missed your

1766
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:41,910
question enough how I'll make

1767
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:43,920
lightweight m2m over chicken into a more

1768
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:49,370
Chico Chico

1769
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:55,230
ah compression right with him - okay

1770
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:57,630
meaning is I mean we have three weeks so

1771
01:42:55,230 --> 01:43:01,349
we we've proven quite efficient on the

1772
01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:03,480
technologies we have so we are doing

1773
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:05,040
this the LMS thing already

1774
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:07,410
I mean some people are working on it so

1775
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:08,550
why not I mean if there is document I

1776
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:08,940
mean I would like to see the document

1777
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:10,590
right

1778
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:13,230
maybe maybe start with the document show

1779
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:15,330
us that there is something to do and

1780
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:24,540
well you need to publish like in the

1781
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:25,800
coming weeks though okay so we will pull

1782
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:28,140
the mailing list on this it would be

1783
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:30,270
great to have a document which shows you

1784
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:32,190
know what what kind of Delta I've just

1785
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:33,719
no clue what's missing in Sheikh as it

1786
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:35,370
stands today to do lightweight them to

1787
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:38,670
add me there are new methods or if it's

1788
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:40,679
more like the coop one so please publish

1789
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:52,290
something so - I understand what the

1790
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:55,230
prophets defining a few more compression

1791
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:57,420
options and then describing that it can

1792
01:43:55,230 --> 01:44:01,759
be done with the technology and system

1793
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:04,410
technology cause it needs to be explored

1794
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:08,820
so it's pretty much like co-op then the

1795
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:13,980
same degree of work I mean please please

1796
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:23,460
stop the dock yesterday is that the food

1797
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:26,280
charter or because well my question is

1798
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:31,500
do we have any move way to to provide

1799
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:33,090
the sender nothing rules but yes so if

1800
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:35,580
if you care let's let's go through

1801
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:37,770
through those slides again so basically

1802
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:40,920
that was the current that was the old

1803
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:45,449
shelter okay and so the old shutter are

1804
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:48,330
the very big item one so ATM to which

1805
01:44:45,449 --> 01:44:51,150
was which we actually split as you can

1806
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:55,250
see okay and then they will go through

1807
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:55,250
chapter two so the rework charter

1808
01:44:56,670 --> 01:45:06,300
so the chapter - yes exactly so we split

1809
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:13,050
those things into so the shake is what

1810
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:15,450
we are so this your question is the icon

1811
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:23,850
- I guess it's the data model right okay

1812
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:27,090
and so items raised all the technology

1813
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:30,780
specific documents and the only new item

1814
01:45:27,090 --> 01:45:33,060
really from the old Charter was this OAM

1815
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:34,259
work that Dominic has presented alright

1816
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,940
so all those things we've been

1817
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:37,920
discussing today so the young model is I

1818
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:40,830
came to in the new Charter and now we

1819
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:43,740
will add an item which would discuss the

1820
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:45,480
primes due to the full model and as

1821
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:49,500
deliverables who would have a prime

1822
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:51,780
statement and a work on fgo that would

1823
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,420
be the new thing and then probably yet

1824
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:58,530
another deliverable to be added to

1825
01:45:54,420 --> 01:46:03,300
actually items 3 so items with a sheik

1826
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:07,080
well is it items REO item 1 about you

1827
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:22,290
know like to attend to a commercial

1828
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:24,360
right a library and included ok so yes

1829
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:26,580
the profile is exactly for that we'll

1830
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,290
need documents in the profile game we

1831
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:31,710
need a document which can have Express

1832
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:34,610
Express is how we expect to push the

1833
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:36,600
profile the new format on both sides and

1834
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:40,469
probably that will be a need for a

1835
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:42,180
provisioning flow which explains how

1836
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:44,820
that happens and if we if we actually

1837
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:46,650
sign the rules then we have to explain

1838
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:48,630
how we make it so that the rules that

1839
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:50,969
are the same on both sides is signature

1840
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:58,670
works so so all this should be in a

1841
01:46:50,970 --> 01:47:01,680
document somewhere ok and we had a last

1842
01:46:58,670 --> 01:47:05,340
item for today which was a presentation

1843
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:07,050
of a 22.8 info by Charlie and Bob but as

1844
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:08,430
it goes as charlie is not there I did

1845
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:10,290
not register the mythical

1846
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:12,660
so I guess we will rethink

1847
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:23,400
what's going on that potato 2.15 for at

1848
01:47:12,660 --> 01:48:08,690
the next IETF which means that we so

1849
01:47:23,400 --> 01:48:08,690
okay so okay

1850
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,959
[Music]

1851
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:38,790
