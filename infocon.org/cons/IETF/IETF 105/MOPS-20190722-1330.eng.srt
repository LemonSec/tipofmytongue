00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,160
you a moment to read it all I will not

16

18
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,930
our agenda for today it's pretty much

19
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,320
well it's the same as the one that is

20
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:11,210
posted in the meeting materials we have

21
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:13,039
a jabber scribe that stock and Kyle Rose

22
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,950
has volunteered have been volunteered

23
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,360
just to take notes Thank You Kyle thank

24
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:25,190
you Matt um any particular bashes to the

25
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:29,620
agenda at this point everybody ready to

26
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:34,070
go all right

27
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,710
so by way of introduction just the

28
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,330
purpose of this particular Boff is to

29
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,090
highlight that there are many existing

30
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,490
video activities ongoing in the IETF as

31
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,979
well as many activities ongoing outside

32
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,280
of the IETF using IETF technologies to

33
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,450
do the

34
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,950
stuff and aware of these facts and

35
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,260
having seen some sort of

36
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:57,320
cross-pollination and failure to cross

37
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,990
pollinate over the years we we in the

38
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,310
group of interested parties here have

39
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,320
for a while been proposing that there

40
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,630
should be some kind of an IETF activity

41
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,360
wearing we could identify a core group

42
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,790
of IETF participants working on video

43
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,740
activities as well as some particular

44
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:17,350
topics that we might want to work on in

45
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:20,050
an ongoing fashion so today

46
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,370
challenges include the fact that those

47
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,040
activities really cover an awful lot of

48
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,600
IETF areas there is no specific one

49
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,030
specific area where all the work gets

50
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,750
done it's everything from transport to

51
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,309
art to int and everywhere else and so

52
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,960
there's no clear single home for it

53
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,580
which is why we've landed here today in

54
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,049
in an effort to try to coordinate some

55
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,210
of those discussions and highlight where

56
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,889
there are issues it started to sound a

57
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,739
little bit like maybe an operational

58
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,240
issue or at least its operational issues

59
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,720
that are driving this discussion so

60
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,790
perhaps there's scope for an Operations

61
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,440
working group so the hope today is to do

62
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,000
enough work to demonstrate whether or

63
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,490
not there is interest here in the IETF

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,780
and whether or not we have clarity to

65
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,740
launch a working group or some other

66
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,099
formal type of group to cover these

67
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,440
topics and I've included at the end of

68
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,260
the session some discussion of the draft

69
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,140
charter that we've been circulating for

70
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,520
a few months now so hopefully we will we

71
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,860
will get to that and have a useful

72
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,599
discussion there but in order to give

73
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,830
sort of an overview and understanding of

74
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,890
the kinds of things we're talking about

75
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,439
we're first going to step through some

76
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,669
substantive material both in terms of

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,460
work that's being done in other

78
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,460
organizations it touches on the work

79
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,669
here plus also some of the some of the

80
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,940
open questions so at this point are

81
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:51,660
there any questions or thoughts before

82
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:55,379
we get into it everybody had

83
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,740
lunch and ready for an afternoon nap all

84
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:13,500
righty then okay so I think we are

85
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:17,879
starting with you hi everybody I'm Glenn

86
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,769
Dean from Comcast NBC Universal

87
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,149
I didn't want to boom in your ears and

88
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,360
wake you guys up I'm Glenn Dean from

89
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:27,240
Comcast NBC Universal we're just gonna

90
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,420
pull the presentation up here closer

91
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,860
even closer oh my gosh okay I will be

92
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,849
loud I'm Glenn D from Comcast NBC

93
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,240
Universal once again and we're just

94
00:09:35,850 --> 00:10:08,639
waiting no pressure

95
00:09:39,240 --> 00:10:11,880
I didn't say I did exactly I think I

96
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,569
think the repentant I think they're up

97
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,550
in the browser

98
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:16,550
there's the tides are already pre opened

99
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,730
so I'm going to do the sort of a

100
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,410
historical context setting for some of

101
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,660
this stuff there's two things I'm going

102
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,250
to show two simple slides the first one

103
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,639
is this there's a draft if you go the

104
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,589
the data tracker for this Boff there's a

105
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,050
draft that sort of has the detail here

106
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,959
but I wanted to bring a tension to the

107
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,630
room to some work done over at sim tea

108
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,300
Cynthia is a society of motion picture

109
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,529
and television engineers these guys do

110
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,180
professional video and for the last

111
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:34,319
while they've been really hard at work

112
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,479
on defining their transition plan to ID

113
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,290
networks and of course they sent you

114
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
what that means is that they're

115
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,990
converting all the stuff they do which

116
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,850
used to use other transport technologies

117
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,910
into IP based stuff that's all depending

118
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,899
upon an ITF RFC's and so what you're

119
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,490
gonna find there if you go look at that

120
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,160
draft it's just it's just a normative

121
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,380
list of the top-level stuff they depend

122
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,029
upon and of course below all of those

123
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,860
references there's references and

124
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:00,060
references or references the takeaway

125
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,399
here is that this is the tip of the

126
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,880
iceberg but the professional video guys

127
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,180
are moving to being built in Thapa for

128
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,310
everything they do on top of IP networks

129
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,660
and as such what they're discovering is

130
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,670
that there's a lot of things that work

131
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,589
really well with that we've done here

132
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,599
the ITF and there's a few things

133
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:22,439
sometimes that are little rough edges

134
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,850
and so part of the historic past year

135
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:25,829
has been bringing some of that

136
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,649
experience operationally from those

137
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:31,638
rough edges back into the ITF as lessons

138
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:35,029
learned and turning them back into

139
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,410
feedback and comments and new work for

140
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:39,420
various working groups it's a very broad

141
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,079
set of working groups transport routing

142
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,079
addressing security

143
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,368
has been stuff that they've all recently

144
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:49,029
been interested in touching so part of

145
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:51,889
the the thing that somewhat motivated

146
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,170
getting us here today is work like this

147
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:56,209
that was constantly popping back up and

148
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,019
saying all those things that are coming

149
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:03,079
in from this space video on IP networks

150
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:09,290
that are important and of interest the

151
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:13,670
ITF and potentially new work and what

152
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:15,589
the other one to please so these are

153
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,248
sort of historical detritus that I'm

154
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,249
showing you right now

155
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,600
so villa one that liz is working on

156
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,699
right now is for the last several years

157
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,440
down there's been a group of people that

158
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,320
have been meeting at a regular aside

159
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,730
meeting at every ITF as we've traveled

160
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,860
the globe and doing our meetings and

161
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,180
this is just a chart of the attendance

162
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,460
here and the take away from this is is

163
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,109
that there's a lot of sort of interests

164
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,610
there from both individuals also from

165
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,730
different organizations so the blue bars

166
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,670
here are the number of people that went

167
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,160
to the to these sightings directly and

168
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,900
the orange bar is the number of

169
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,930
organizations that were represented at

170
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,130
that particular meeting there's a few

171
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,829
data points missing areas we didn't

172
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:33,170
record very well but the takeaway here

173
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:34,670
also is back at IDF 98 we decided to

174
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,709
hold a little before he said hey if

175
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,260
you're just an Nvidia with the ITF come

176
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,490
meet us at this bar over in Chicago

177
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,030
while we're all there and I put that out

178
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:47,420
on the list of attendees about 7:00 p.m.

179
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,500
on Friday by midday Saturday discovered

180
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,910
there's so many people have stopped me

181
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,170
in the hallway said that's an important

182
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,810
topic to me I want to talk to you about

183
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,670
it that we realized we wouldn't be able

184
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,739
to go to the bar we were gonna go to so

185
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,890
we ended up in a bigger room the bigger

186
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,300
room held about 70 people in the end we

187
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,620
were in the room we filled them in to

188
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,839
capacity there was three me out into the

189
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,040
hallway and a rough head count of the

190
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,100
times that we had about 10 percent of

191
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,900
the ITF attendees at that ITF 98 we're

192
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,870
trying to get into that Boff just to

193
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,840
talk about the topic of video so a lot

194
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,820
of passion there in the end of 62 people

195
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,230
successfully actually were able get

196
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,690
their name on the blue sheet but we had

197
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,640
a lot more going on one of the lessons

198
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,820
we took it away from that first attempt

199
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,660
to sort of say are people interested was

200
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,250
that there was a lot of people

201
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,900
interested but we needed to sort of

202
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,090
concentrate the conversation down a

203
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,709
little bit to get organized and get our

204
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,630
heads around some of the topic space and

205
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,240
so we sold the people well there's this

206
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,550
other male in this 3 it had GG at ITF if

207
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,960
you're interested go sign up to that and

208
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,150
that's we're gonna put out the call for

209
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,810
more ongoing video and just group side

210
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,000
meetings

211
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,890
and so we did that and we ended up into

212
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,350
the smaller group which we did advertise

213
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,760
widely but we didn't hide it either but

214
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,279
it allowed us to spend time talking

215
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,930
about you know where we where we going

216
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,610
and end up that there's a series of

217
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,500
presentations people cadenced are doing

218
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,050
as a regular part of this I me they

219
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,850
weren't really well those in fact are

220
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,920
archived if you go to our media

221
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,260
materials the there's a pointer over to

222
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,849
where we have stored them on the web the

223
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,080
administer there and the presentations

224
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:22,580
there so you can sort of see the history

225
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:36,820
here as well but that's my bit okay your

226
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:36,820
next events

227
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,550
all right thank you good afternoon my

228
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,980
name is Sanjay Mishra

229
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,129
so I start this presentation talking

230
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,010
about an industry consortium but more so

231
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,970
from the point of view that what happens

232
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:16,030
in IETF does not stain IETF it actually

233
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,569
goes out in a real world for some real

234
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:22,680
world implementations specifically

235
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,710
focusing on the Internet community and

236
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,780
by the same token the work that goes out

237
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:31,690
into the real world there are

238
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:35,190
implementations in the real world that

239
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:38,500
actually may have feedback into the IETF

240
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:41,410
based on using the standardization work

241
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,330
and based on what the real world

242
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,740
implementation is teaching and some of

243
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,490
that may actually come back into the

244
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:51,000
IETF so the the intent here is to kind

245
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:54,160
of give you an example of one such

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,310
symbiotic relationship of where we take

247
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,720
the work from IIT F and then potentially

248
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:04,510
look to feed back into the IETF alright

249
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,180
so that said let me just kind of walk

250
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,830
you through with one such example of

251
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,770
what I just said

252
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:16,240
so the streaming video Alliance is

253
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:19,420
really is an ecosystem really focusing

254
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,270
on single aspect of addressing the over

255
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,400
the top streaming at scale and then

256
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,540
within the SVA there are several

257
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,130
different working groups but I'm just

258
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,560
talking about only one working group

259
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,100
here right now which is the open caching

260
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:35,940
working group and the open caching work

261
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,520
working group is primarily focused on

262
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,760
interoperability amongst various players

263
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,800
that includes the content providers

264
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,480
commercial Sirians technology vendors

265
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:52,480
and the Internet service providers

266
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:57,010
basically to try to address the issue of

267
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,230
delivery of the video and that of course

268
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,860
with the goal of improving the overall

269
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:05,320
latency and also the Keowee as well so

270
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,389
from the implementation point of view

271
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,120
what is open caching doing so open

272
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,990
caching started its war

273
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:18,370
primarily rooted in the CDN I working a

274
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,470
CD and I RFC's and really the the

275
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,529
analogy that I can drive here is that

276
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,470
open caching is is really a special case

277
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:28,120
of CDN I where you have CDN I defines

278
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,600
basically enough strain CDN and a

279
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,879
downstream CDN and defines the protocols

280
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,100
the rails that allows the to CBN's to be

281
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,080
able to communicate so so really the

282
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,969
open caching is in a special case in the

283
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,629
sense that open caching is the

284
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,580
downstream CDN and any entity that is

285
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,520
delegating content to it is in upstream

286
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:52,059
CDN it's a little bit more off it in the

287
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,629
next slide so I talked about

288
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:58,840
interoperability so really the open

289
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:02,980
caching compliance solutions they're not

290
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,678
only based on the CDN I RFC's but based

291
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,620
on the real-world implementation there's

292
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,110
also a feedback into the CDN I working

293
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,899
group that hey we've done we've done

294
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,240
implementation based on CD and I RFC's

295
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:17,889
but we also sees see areas of

296
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,149
improvement where we can feed back into

297
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:24,190
the IETF now in this particular case the

298
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,399
the feedback mechanism was fairly

299
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,620
straightforward in the sense that we

300
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:32,529
have taken the RFC's from CDN I working

301
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,000
group and then identified areas within

302
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:35,710
those RFC's where we think there are

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,179
improvements so we can feed them back oh

304
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,010
there was a very straightforward process

305
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:41,380
in terms of knowing where to go back to

306
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,658
but sometimes that may not be the case

307
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,570
as to not knowing where we need to go

308
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,789
back to so really if you look at just as

309
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,980
a quick example

310
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,658
basically there are two drafts in the

311
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,090
IETF right now in the CDN our working

312
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:57,789
group that feedback into the process one

313
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,490
is basically RFC 8008 and the other one

314
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,590
is RFC 8007 and I've listed some of the

315
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,529
features that we have identified and

316
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,350
have drafted them back into the working

317
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:10,539
group such as defining new objects for

318
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:14,168
dynamic footprint edit resonance and

319
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:16,299
also allowing a mechanism for the DC for

320
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,539
the you CDN to be able to publish it's a

321
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:22,510
feedback its fallback address to avoid

322
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:23,470
the loopback and also on the CDN I

323
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,240
interface

324
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,820
and triggers there are a bunch of

325
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,980
enhancements that make the protocol much

326
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,168
more agile in terms of what

327
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,539
functionality you can add to it and you

328
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:37,690
can read the drafts in the there should

329
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:39,850
have been a link in the draft anyway you

330
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:45,220
can look up these drafts in the in the

331
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,658
working group so having said that so we

332
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,520
in this case we clearly see

333
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:51,280
interoperability and we know whether

334
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,510
whether feedback is but sometimes that

335
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,370
may not be very clear so within the open

336
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,590
caching working group we have a very

337
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,309
clearly defined path and we know some of

338
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,408
the feedback that we can provide to and

339
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:07,030
we're also looking at additional

340
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,710
opportunities where we know we can

341
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,190
leverage the work which is going on in

342
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,350
the IETF in certain working groups HTTP

343
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,380
this is of one of the working group that

344
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,418
we we see a couple of work items there

345
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,940
that are very applicable to open caching

346
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,909
and we're going to be looking at lifting

347
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,990
and reusing as much work as we can

348
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:29,130
there's also issues on the certificate

349
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,240
management and we are closely monitoring

350
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,280
some of the work that's going on in the

351
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,640
TLS working group and as well as and the

352
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,710
Acme working group and there's a draft

353
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,620
also in CDN our working group that sort

354
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,570
of bridges what are the specific

355
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,928
commands you would need to use in order

356
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,820
to use either the sub source or the star

357
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:51,780
based delegation method between the two

358
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,580
CDN that are trying to use one of those

359
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,020
mechanism for delegation so some of that

360
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,699
work you know we're monitoring and then

361
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,090
we're again providing feedback there

362
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,679
they're also looking at the alto working

363
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,350
group there are certain metrics that we

364
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,020
can leverage so so that's this really

365
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,928
very a clearly defined task but then

366
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,480
there are some challenges as well there

367
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,270
are things that we are looking at so

368
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,299
basically one of them is just the

369
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,549
consistent interpretation of the video

370
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:24,309
players on the browsers or any other way

371
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:26,168
where the browsers do not necessarily

372
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:28,600
not the browser's but the video players

373
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:31,059
I should say do not necessarily always

374
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,340
have the common interpretation of what

375
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,530
has been laid out in the RFC s so some

376
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,059
of the work is really more practical and

377
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,039
it's not something that the

378
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,749
necessarily need to change but maybe

379
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,360
there's more priority that needs to be

380
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:45,009
added so we're looking at some of the

381
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,139
work and see how we can bring that back

382
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:49,960
as to what clarity is that we think is

383
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:51,459
needed there are other issues also with

384
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,110
respect to bit rate shifts and the

385
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,799
retransmissions because those both

386
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:58,990
impact the QE and then the 360 virtual

387
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,379
we are we are looking at several

388
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,960
different mechanism of how best we can

389
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:06,939
address the latency issue because motion

390
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,970
to photon is a big issue and latency is

391
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,730
a big big part of it so these are the

392
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,830
challenges and I'm not sure if there's a

393
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,330
clear path always defined to us that we

394
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:21,059
can take it back to a specific working

395
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:23,619
group so so that actually brings to our

396
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,009
intent as to why mops and we think that

397
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:29,139
mops provide provide us a common ground

398
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:31,389
where we can have a soft landing bring

399
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,519
some issues and then seek direction as

400
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:34,869
to where we need to go is there a

401
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,149
working group that is addressing that

402
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:39,459
issue or or is there a working group

403
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:41,199
that may be willing to take that problem

404
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,480
that we bring to as a as an issue that

405
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,519
they want to work on or maybe establish

406
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,869
a new working group but if the issue can

407
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,570
be looked at so these are some of the

408
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:51,699
things that we think maps provide us a

409
00:24:49,570 --> 00:25:07,689
way to come back to bring issues and

410
00:24:51,700 --> 00:25:09,580
provide feedback and that's all do we

411
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,869
have a liaison to the SVA because that's

412
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,249
what they sound like they need is

413
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:16,959
someone to help do that answered we do

414
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:18,909
not currently have a SP a liaison

415
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,909
between the i7 and sorry I should have

416
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:23,379
said : Jax okay I mean would that meet

417
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,360
some of the needs of knowing where to

418
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:30,610
take feedback that was unclear to what

419
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:34,990
various working groups you want so my

420
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:37,779
two cents are that it helps it's a start

421
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,879
but one of the challenges too is that

422
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:43,779
there's a lot of video specific sort of

423
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:46,080
expertise of knowledge that sometimes

424
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:47,710
needs to be combined with those asks and

425
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,330
one of the things that we're thinking

426
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,770
with mops would allow would be a

427
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,500
concentration of that skill

428
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,879
expertise so that when these do come in

429
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,120
they can sort of have a place to nurture

430
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,250
and be developed and then meaningfully

431
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,750
you know capture it in IDs that

432
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,730
eventually may fall into other working

433
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,350
groups at the ITF but they will have

434
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,690
already been a little bit more mature

435
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,870
with sort of a video technology

436
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:12,160
expertise added onto them because in the

437
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,750
past a lot of times that when people

438
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,280
bring things in they sometimes hit a

439
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,750
group and the group doesn't quickly what

440
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,389
to do with them or consume with because

441
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,950
they aren't quite ready yep and so sort

442
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,770
of the thought here is is try to fight

443
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,480
away as Sunday said provide a soft

444
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,230
landing place for them so they can

445
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,460
mature Berkeley a little bit okay thank

446
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:37,690
you hi I'm Jamie can you go back to the

447
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,500
slide fall okay I have a qualification

448
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,270
equation actually when you speak about

449
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,600
opportunities are you speaking about

450
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:50,410
opportunities for the mobs a shorter on

451
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:58,870
the slide for you see that also I was

452
00:26:50,410 --> 00:27:02,710
just listening out from from Orange so

453
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:07,120
the what I'm looking here is that there

454
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:09,820
are areas where SVA can basically

455
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,610
forklift work that already exist so

456
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,290
these we see as opportunity clearly

457
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,030
there's some work that we can reuse we

458
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,879
don't have to reinvent the wheel when

459
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,980
there's work that already exists so just

460
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,980
like the HTTP cache had a response I

461
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,870
think that something is very useful for

462
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,580
SVA members to be able to use that work

463
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:33,909
so I think those are very clearly

464
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:36,760
defined paths opportunity for us veer to

465
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,890
be able to partner with IETF and and

466
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,830
reuse the work and then the challenges

467
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,020
are some other things that you know may

468
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,760
or may not have a clear path for us to

469
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:50,590
go to we don't know whether it's really

470
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,900
a HTTP working group issue the the RFC

471
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,639
3986 that I reflect we have had some

472
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,510
conversations on that with the HTTP

473
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:02,169
working group and the RFC does not say

474
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:05,140
anything the RFC is clear but it's it's

475
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:07,030
the in the interpretation of what you

476
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,820
and what the implementation is that

477
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:12,100
might exactly not mimic what the RFC was

478
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,200
originally intending to say so those are

479
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,679
like a little bit of a finer issues that

480
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,800
may not necessarily have that requires

481
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,510
RFC 3986 to be revised but maybe they

482
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,860
can be in a helpful document that sort

483
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,260
of publishes that what might be the

484
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:29,800
guidelines to interpret that so there is

485
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,030
in a an area where we think we might be

486
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,470
able to write something and bring it

487
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,090
back to the IETF because that's a

488
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,740
challenge that's something that's not a

489
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,959
clearly defined solution that we see out

490
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,630
there if we know that that there are

491
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,210
video players that are not always behave

492
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,010
inconsistently with respect to that yeah

493
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,610
but respect to when they are redirected

494
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:50,680
to the final source then are always able

495
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,629
to maintain that session with that they

496
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,310
might actually go back again and then

497
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:58,900
get redirected so which means that

498
00:28:54,310 --> 00:29:00,550
you've lost some time in between that

499
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,250
this is good for ESPE a but what's in it

500
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,590
for the IGF if you put this together

501
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,390
with the slide I showed about the word

502
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,000
that simply is also doing on the I'm

503
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,890
moving to ip-based networks these are

504
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,300
clearly groups that are making use of

505
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:17,770
the work we do in here at the ITF and

506
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,290
instead of saying to them well hey why

507
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,700
don't you go do IGF networking work over

508
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,010
in your place and then bring it back

509
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,840
here potentially it seems to me please

510
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,300
to me it makes more sense for the ITF to

511
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,939
with this expertise on ip-based networks

512
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,419
and all the something was around it to

513
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,920
do the work here it won't play in one

514
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,990
place and get it right especially with

515
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,340
the expertise of the ITF and then let

516
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:43,930
these other groups whatever they do with

517
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:46,929
it consume and make use of it yeah so

518
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,820
there are two benefits for ITF you know

519
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,940
why one is clearly as you see here that

520
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,860
there's we have you reuse the RFC's and

521
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,390
dividend defied areas of improvement so

522
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,340
I think that really feeds back into the

523
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,200
IETF and second thing is that we still

524
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,149
have issues that that need to find a

525
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,770
home and it's not very all it's not

526
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,330
always easy to know where to go exactly

527
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:10,930
in this case it was very straightforward

528
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:13,030
where we needed to go getting some new

529
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,440
people to come into the room when they

530
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,910
if we have these things to work on here

531
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,370
that are interested in passing but

532
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,040
coming to enjoy the organization recent

533
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:28,250
fresh blood and

534
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:32,350
to the ITF never hurts right Thank You

535
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,350
Sanjay and next I think we have Justin

536
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,619
[Music]

537
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm Justin Uberti from Google I've

538
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,130
worked on the WebRTC domain for quite

539
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,520
some time but Google we do a lot of

540
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,990
video streaming and some of the video

541
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,340
streaming we're all in the WebRTC world

542
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,140
is starting to come together I'll sort

543
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,889
of talk about some of the things they're

544
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,480
happening there

545
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,800
we just talked in the previous

546
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,450
presentation about some of the

547
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,720
challenges and one of them is how to

548
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:33,800
deal with low latency environments I'll

549
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:37,790
get right into that next slide so this

550
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,800
is a quick overview of like what you

551
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,230
would consider to be like the latency

552
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,580
screaming and the streaming landscape

553
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,580
today in the latency buckets that are

554
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,310
available and you know from the WebRTC

555
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,050
side you know the fact that like 10

556
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,179
seconds is considered being low latency

557
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,919
seems kind of crazy but that is sort of

558
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,140
some of the stuff that exists today for

559
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,400
VOD content which is Supriya recorded

560
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,030
material it doesn't really matter that

561
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,530
much what the actual latency is and we

562
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:06,139
start seeing some of the challenges and

563
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,639
things like online sports where like

564
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,320
people perhaps in an apartment complex

565
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,760
you know have the experience of hearing

566
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,560
their neighbors yelling out you know

567
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,110
cheering before they actually see what's

568
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,060
happened and this can happen just

569
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,520
because of the physics of like okay

570
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,909
where's their playhead versus like their

571
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,620
neighbors

572
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:24,470
did they have packing loss or to their

573
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,209
neighbors and so there's some desire to

574
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,400
try to move everything toward the right

575
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,580
you know not every situation requires

576
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,840
this but there are many cases where in

577
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,059
low latency is

578
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,350
just important is actually critical next

579
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:41,418
slide or right here alright so um you

580
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,889
know this is our typical streaming and

581
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,630
for those who have you have been not

582
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,400
asleep the past few years like this is

583
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,590
now like the vast majority of all

584
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,250
traffic on the Internet is you know

585
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,840
online video and so there's some

586
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,179
technical stuff here about exactly how

587
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,428
the stuff is coded but it's gently coded

588
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,740
for like maximal picture quality and for

589
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,570
easy you see though they jump into the

590
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,669
streamed referred to BC Keable you know

591
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,770
really at any point and so there's this

592
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:10,130
GOP group of picture sighs there's a

593
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,570
frames that depend on previous frames we

594
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,270
were called bi-directional frames and

595
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,340
the way this generally works is that you

596
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:19,700
know the player the stream are basically

597
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,980
sending out chunks of a video the player

598
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,169
then downloads them ahead of time once

599
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,970
it feels like it has enough video source

600
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,409
stored up a then actually can start

601
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,029
playing that out and then keeps

602
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:31,419
downloading more and more chunks to try

603
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:34,159
to keep you know its buffer full and

604
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:36,049
make sure that the the user never see is

605
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,450
like a frozen picture because it has a

606
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,799
head and underflow what this means

607
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,020
though is it needs to build up a pretty

608
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,480
comfortable amount of data to make sure

609
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,190
that underflow never occurs usually this

610
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,390
stuff is being transmitted over TCP

611
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,510
which means that there's head-of-line

612
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,640
blocking and so I won lost packet can

613
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,529
cause the stream to stall and so the

614
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,330
player need to be pretty conservative to

615
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:58,970
basically build up this buffer to make

616
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,189
sure it never runs out of data now one

617
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,429
of the great things here is that CD ends

618
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,260
work really well here there's a lot of

619
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:07,909
things and like you know an ITF there's

620
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,560
more FCS for this where basically the

621
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:12,320
streamer can just start copying

622
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,580
basically chunks to the CD ends or CD

623
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,159
ends can be you know pulling them from

624
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,659
from the streamer and there's really not

625
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,849
a whole lot of logic that's involved

626
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:22,070
here you know so the client wants a

627
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,599
block it asks for from the CDN C and

628
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,609
goes and post in the stream or caches it

629
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,440
then the next client that comes along

630
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:29,179
can get that exact same block there's

631
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,790
not a whole lot of I mean there's a lot

632
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:35,330
of stuff that has to happen but it's not

633
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:37,489
it's mostly copying data and even in the

634
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,319
player it's mostly just doing xhr and

635
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,810
then pulling that data down and then

636
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,220
passing it into the actual decoder but

637
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,719
where this turns into all these various

638
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,810
things how it's encoded how it's

639
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,000
delivered

640
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,710
you know the over GOP size the buffer it

641
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,810
all turns into multiple second stuff up

642
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:55,730
and I can see you know and that's even

643
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:59,910
in the good case so necks are moving on

644
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:02,400
the there's a certain growing thing of

645
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,259
like these low latency scenarios and so

646
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,610
twitch people are streaming their game

647
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,840
they want to talk about exactly what's

648
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,550
happening as they see it they don't want

649
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,080
to basically say you know be chatting

650
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,550
about something and have it be like five

651
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,620
seconds behind real-time where they're

652
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,390
talking about something in the past

653
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,859
there's this a plot HQ trivia where

654
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,600
basically there's this guy who basically

655
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,010
announces trivia questions in live over

656
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,049
video and then they have people up to

657
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,580
answer so the latency is really

658
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,810
important because they're expected to

659
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,970
answer in a very short period of time

660
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,440
and then this new service that you know

661
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,879
Google is rolling out called Google

662
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,550
stadia which is basically sort of

663
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,740
Netflix for gaming where you have a very

664
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,240
simple you know client on the on your

665
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,859
device and the games actually running in

666
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,299
the data center and streaming down to

667
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,970
the device and I'll talk a little bit

668
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,700
more about this you know in terms of

669
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,529
overall traffic I did some quick math on

670
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,569
this it looks like this about 1% of all

671
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,930
the traffic that that chrome sees and

672
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,520
growing you know this is you know a

673
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,839
category that I think is starting to

674
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,550
ramp up and there's a reason that number

675
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,170
reasons why it's complicated and it's

676
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,110
taking a while to get going but I expect

677
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,070
to see this continue to increase there

678
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,230
are a lot of things that are technically

679
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,580
different here the way the stream is

680
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,530
constructed is different there's no

681
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,450
typically no group of pictures there's

682
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,010
no bi-directional frames everything's

683
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,480
designed to be the minimal and latency

684
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,220
you have a single frame to start the

685
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,080
stream and then you know just Delta

686
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,759
frames from that and then it's not

687
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,860
delivered typically over TCP it's

688
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,060
delivered over you know protocol is made

689
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,830
for real-time that don't have head

690
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:28,860
online blocking and can deal with losses

691
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:30,960
either WebRTC or RT MFP you know RT M a

692
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,970
few actually used by bi HQ trivia and

693
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,890
these things all you know they can

694
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,629
basically understand you know what is

695
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,069
the bandwidth between the streamer and

696
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,990
the client very easily and they can also

697
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,460
have the the status of every single

698
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,720
frame that's being delivered every

699
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,100
single packet that's being delivered and

700
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,750
can community the client communicate

701
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,549
that back and they can know if there's

702
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,050
losses that they need to re-encode a new

703
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,760
frame based on what the client knows

704
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,350
that has received or if has to be

705
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,940
transmitted or PI error correction etc

706
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:57,240
it needs to be a little more complicated

707
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,430
than the typical TCP streaming there's

708
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,930
often no playout buffer here that

709
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,578
you know if it runs out of data then

710
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,529
it'll just sort of try to unlike send a

711
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,509
message back to get a new frame and

712
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:08,190
continue on it won't try to build up

713
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:10,440
this big buffer so it can have a very

714
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,869
small amount of latency but the main

715
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,089
thing is because of all of this you know

716
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:18,210
the existing CD and Technology does not

717
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:19,440
work super well that you know there are

718
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,359
all these sort of protocols that are

719
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,329
different than what CDNs are used to

720
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,769
deal with dealing with and there's no

721
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:28,650
simple ability just copies and files

722
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:30,660
that really any of these edge streamers

723
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,069
need to be able to estimate the

724
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,359
bandwidth down to the client they need

725
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:35,700
to deal with what happens that that

726
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,930
client is now missing a picture they

727
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,859
need to basically be more interactive

728
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:42,690
than today's CTN streamers but what you

729
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:46,140
can do if you do all the stuff right is

730
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,910
you get sub-second latency and so stadia

731
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:52,109
is perhaps the most extreme example of

732
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:54,269
some of this a typical PC game you know

733
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,249
in the best configured case the delta

734
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:57,899
between human input and stuff being

735
00:37:56,249 --> 00:38:00,359
displayed on the screen is about 100

736
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,099
milliseconds and in the typical

737
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,019
deployments where you see someone's game

738
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,029
console and it's hooked up to some TV

739
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:07,799
it's got motion smoothing and like you

740
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:09,839
know some audio receiver with like DSP

741
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:12,839
set to like dance club mode it can

742
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,640
easily be be 200 250 milliseconds and so

743
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,989
stevia today is delivering you know

744
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,868
about a hundred fifty milliseconds and

745
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:21,809
to end it's been tested you know but by

746
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:23,279
actual people in the field and and you

747
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:25,829
know what actually is happening here is

748
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:28,440
the game is being run on a data center

749
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:30,720
machine input is being streamed up from

750
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,700
the game controller to the to that

751
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,649
machine and then the actual video is

752
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,480
being pushed down up there for gameplay

753
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,999
you know to the device which then plays

754
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,099
it out just like any other sort of low

755
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:43,078
latency video stream and so that that

756
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,849
just like it can be super simple it can

757
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,890
be a streaming TV stick it can be a

758
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:48,119
mobile device it can be a Chromebook it

759
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,950
can really be anything that can just

760
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,319
display video it doesn't have to have a

761
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,819
super high end GPU which has been like

762
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:55,950
you know the requirement for high end

763
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:57,329
gaming you know up until now I just have

764
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:01,200
a clarification

765
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:02,519
Kyle Rose Akamai so the 150 milliseconds

766
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,730
to end end is that the round-trip time

767
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,439
essentially like put and then the time

768
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:11,269
between you hit a button until the time

769
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,269
you see your character jump or move ever

770
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,289
so

771
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:17,910
right now sort of you know a lot of

772
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:20,069
video streaming is happening in the sort

773
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,470
of single-digit megabit range you see

774
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:24,779
like 720p at maybe three or four megabit

775
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,359
you see 1080p maybe like six eight maybe

776
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,280
even 10 megabit on the minimum first

777
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,890
idea right now is 15 megabit and they

778
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,710
sort of recommended this 25 megabit and

779
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,930
that's for 1080p 30 streaming the expect

780
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:40,289
expectation is that this will get to 4k

781
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:41,339
60 and you know they even at the city or

782
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:44,760
in launch meant they talked about doing

783
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:47,630
8k 120 which would be you know a 200

784
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,859
megabit you know sort of range so on

785
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,930
this is kind of moving things and like a

786
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,098
you know a bit further down the sort of

787
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,348
latency critical and high-end

788
00:39:53,099 --> 00:40:02,130
performance range so how does stuff all

789
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:03,960
work it's pretty complicated so you

790
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,930
those numbers you just quoted the 25

791
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:11,369
megabits and the 200 megabits range that

792
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:14,788
isn't the the the pipe size that you

793
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:17,010
need that's actually continuous stream

794
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:19,819
size that section coming down the pipe

795
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,799
yet in the entire time I mean I think

796
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:24,930
it's not there's some lumpiness but yeah

797
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:26,670
yeah it's it's not like you get it all

798
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:31,859
at once and then plays out it's like

799
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:35,039
it's continuous so staging runs over

800
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,750
WebRTC and there's a bunch of different

801
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,510
things that happen like the actual app

802
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:42,150
you know does our pcs over HTTP the

803
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:45,809
video is sent over typical WebRTC which

804
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:48,660
is SRTP over ice then the game on input

805
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:52,380
is sent up over a data Channel this also

806
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:55,379
kind of is lost tolerant so it's got

807
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:59,359
Iceland DTS SCTV which is basically that

808
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,980
the normal web RTC set of protocols but

809
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,869
there's not a lot of off-the-shelf stuff

810
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,670
you can use here HTTP has done some

811
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,619
wonderful things about all sort of load

812
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,359
balancers and like front-end gateways

813
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,930
and other things that you know for

814
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,220
basically scaling up a service and not

815
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,940
just stadia but really everybody is

816
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,558
doing this by hand

817
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,339
yeah they have to build like their own

818
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:22,020
server stacks the handle WebRTC and it's

819
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:24,328
it's not a simple static people are

820
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,859
having to doing a lot of work here so I

821
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:26,500
think there's a real opportunity to try

822
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,869
to bring

823
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,690
the existing streaming world and this

824
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:35,109
low latency streaming world together in

825
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,490
one potential thing here is if we can

826
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,950
nationally use some of what's been done

827
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,899
and quick to make all this happen nicely

828
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,210
right it guy h3 coming out build on top

829
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,640
of quick there's a lot of stuff that we

830
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,220
could do with quick selassie things that

831
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,720
can use it to send data grams for the

832
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,660
actual control and I think there's some

833
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,819
ways we could sort of layer media on top

834
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,348
of quick as well and so maybe at some

835
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,630
point in time the future we could get a

836
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:00,700
simpler protocol stack and then have

837
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,680
some of the you know front end servers

838
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,200
that are basically doing quick from load

839
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,118
balancing for horizontal scaling for

840
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,279
authentication etc to also be able to

841
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,300
handle media streams and I think this

842
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,640
will make everyone's life a lot easier

843
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,220
and kind of Usher in you making low

844
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,359
latency streaming not the sort of one

845
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:27,879
percent case but really like the

846
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:34,920
majority case so we can hope thanks to

847
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:38,619
far away high risk' from cable labs

848
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,440
you've focused on the protocol itself

849
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:43,330
getting itself low delay but of course

850
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,790
it's there's potentially other traffic

851
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:49,470
there and this cueing that causes delay

852
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:52,690
no matter how good the protocol is and

853
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:56,500
so I would have thought that's more sort

854
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:58,690
of media rock-type problem than sure I

855
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,960
mean if you don't have if you if your

856
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,839
parent if your pipe is congested not

857
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,000
congested just up a traffic there well

858
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,720
sure I mean if they right I guess I

859
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,210
point some of these things are

860
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,709
structural that even if your pipe is you

861
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,480
know you know you don't have a lot of

862
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,800
you know other traffic there some of

863
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,480
these things just how the videos been

864
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,500
coded how it's being sent down you're

865
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,750
just not gonna get the performance you

866
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,089
want and so even in the best case you're

867
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,280
kind of a done lock certainly if things

868
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:26,349
are not ideal even if you have you know

869
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,940
some other technology it's still not

870
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:29,440
gonna work right either so I'm like

871
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,089
that's his own set of challenges and

872
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,980
like media ops level you know I can

873
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:35,080
consider how cui make that stuff work

874
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,170
better to it that what been going on

875
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,830
into spw for four years on that and it's

876
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,370
nearly finished you know with

877
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:46,759
queuing delay for all traffic in the sub

878
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,859
millisecond range so you know I'm Matt

879
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,620
I'm from cable apps cable industry's

880
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,880
gonna be deploying it next year there's

881
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,160
all the specs are written and everything

882
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,690
so I'm just sort of surprised don't know

883
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,490
about that

884
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:02,630
well I mean yeah I mean I think the

885
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,040
important one of the important things

886
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,040
out of this whole presentation was just

887
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:15,710
sort of the getting an appreciation of

888
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:17,660
the magnitude so that their cross

889
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:21,140
pollination pointers to other useful

890
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:23,930
things yeah yeah I mean the cueing isn't

891
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:30,049
the only problem is yeah yeah all the

892
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:32,120
other things I'm just saying I'm curious

893
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:35,690
about the B traits with you have there

894
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:40,220
because for the high low latency it was

895
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:42,770
like 25 for 10 10 10 ATP but for

896
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,680
streaming like Netflix this is not the

897
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:48,050
same rate I mean the B traits that are

898
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,149
needed right I mean there's a few things

899
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:53,090
that are all combined here one is that

900
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:55,130
for the Netflix case your Netflix done

901
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,080
an amazing job basically trying to get

902
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,790
the most of every bit and they can

903
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,350
basically go through and recode like

904
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,520
every single chunk you know with a bunch

905
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,470
of different quantization other

906
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,000
parameters to get like you know the

907
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,859
ideal setting because it's like once

908
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,020
they do any sort of VOD thing they don't

909
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,910
need to do it again whereas like for

910
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,870
stadia like every single frame is like

911
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:15,020
the first time is probably ever been

912
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,819
seen ever also like you know there's

913
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,430
being done by hardware said of our

914
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,570
encoders the typical sort of psnr of

915
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,069
hardware encoders tends to be a little

916
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,620
bit more less then like you know the

917
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:27,350
best offline are the best no offline you

918
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,120
know software encoders and there's also

919
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:32,630
just very low tolerance for artifacts

920
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,830
like an in this scenario too and so the

921
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,530
bit rates are a little bit higher for

922
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:39,860
the same resolution just given like some

923
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:43,880
of those limitations repair to pay own

924
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,920
to add to a justin is saying keep in

925
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,780
mind that video is inherently stateful

926
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,730
and gets all of its or rather

927
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,670
compression is inherently stateful and

928
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,600
video that we send over the Internet is

929
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:58,160
always compressed because

930
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:59,810
it just won't work and the less state

931
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,390
you have to refer to the less you can

932
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:04,160
compress so the shorter these delays are

933
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:07,009
the less effective your compression is

934
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,379
so you will always have an inherent

935
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,900
trade-off between the latency of the

936
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,680
delivery and the bits per pixel or

937
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,060
pixels per bit that you can deliver

938
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,299
separately to address a comment that was

939
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:22,370
made earlier I want to point out that in

940
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,280
order for these applications to work

941
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:28,970
really well we have to have an l7 and an

942
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,820
elf for that and below that all agree to

943
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,129
do the right thing and having an awesome

944
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,230
l4 and an l7 that doesn't adapt or that

945
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,550
doesn't work well across the multiple

946
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,250
different surfaces that we want to

947
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:42,350
attach to is still going to cause a

948
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,050
whole lot of pain and that's one of the

949
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:47,390
slides that Justin presented earlier

950
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,800
right so I mean these things are whole

951
00:46:47,390 --> 00:47:21,500
stack things because they are whole

952
00:46:48,800 --> 00:47:26,420
stack things thank you Jake Holland so I

953
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:29,300
wrote a draft a proposed work item for

954
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,680
this working group and so I was going to

955
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:35,120
talk about that and some of the

956
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:42,560
motivations behind it I named it mops

957
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:45,220
taxonomy good so what I'm going for here

958
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:50,299
is a doc I wish I had a few years back

959
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:52,609
and the point is to try to kind of cover

960
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:56,000
the video issues that you encounter in

961
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:58,700
networking and to give people a kind of

962
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,930
overview into what's what we're looking

963
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:04,640
for and to to be a when you're making a

964
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,470
new solution to be something you can

965
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,900
point at to say I'm solving this problem

966
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,569
in this

967
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:14,520
that kind of thing I thought that would

968
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:18,810
be hopefully useful so as an overview

969
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,460
the the the current draft has the first

970
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:22,710
two sections I think bandwidth is the

971
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,840
biggest thing that bandwidth

972
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,780
requirements of video and media in

973
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,580
general on the Internet today you know

974
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:34,380
as as Justin showed it it's the vast

975
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,630
mnDOT's the vast majority of current

976
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,370
traffic but that's only the tip of the

977
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:42,750
iceberg for the demand for the traffic

978
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:43,980
so um address that a little bit and I

979
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,480
talked a little bit about the congestion

980
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,460
avoidance strategies I think there's a

981
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,250
couple other sections that could be

982
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,020
added I love feedback on you know

983
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:55,110
weather conferencing should be a part of

984
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:57,930
this and and maybe the kind of low

985
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,930
latency use cases just heard about and

986
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:03,480
then I'd love to have kind of a pointer

987
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:06,149
to a page where we could maintain a set

988
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:10,620
of implementations I think that would be

989
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:12,390
a valuable contribution to to get people

990
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,299
up to speed when they try to enter this

991
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:20,040
space or they find a need to engage with

992
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:22,800
it so the banner with requirements I go

993
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,630
over just the kind of perceiver what's

994
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,410
necessary I have a formula that I pull

995
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:30,900
that out a thing you know how

996
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:33,629
replicating the the traffic addresses

997
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,010
that and the you know the kind of

998
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,830
different ways of replicating with

999
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,090
caching and multicast some of the

1000
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,779
effects and challenges that go with that

1001
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:44,970
and a suggestion from oli that's not in

1002
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:49,610
there yet is the live versus on-demand

1003
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:54,569
and also covering asymmetric links and

1004
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:57,060
the to reprise kind of the motivation

1005
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:59,550
behind this a few slides from from

1006
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:03,450
Prague the you know when you just do the

1007
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:06,600
math 72 said the Akuma is one of the you

1008
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:09,480
know major CD ends on the internet they

1009
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,910
published in December they're their

1010
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,460
latest record was 72 terabytes per

1011
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,980
second delivered to end-users and when

1012
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,590
you just take the 40 megabits required

1013
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,290
to send a 4k standard traffic and you do

1014
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,780
the division

1015
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,720
you get like 1.8 million simultaneous

1016
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,070
viewers is what can be supported at that

1017
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:32,549
kind of traffic

1018
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:35,610
level to set a new record if the entire

1019
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:38,920
platform is dedicated to sending that

1020
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:41,950
and you know if you if you look at like

1021
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,290
how many viewers is 1.8 million viewers

1022
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:50,140
that's like that's the audience size for

1023
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:54,490
the number 179 Nielsen rated program

1024
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:57,759
from from last year so it's just it

1025
00:50:54,490 --> 00:51:01,120
doesn't really touch on the what's

1026
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,740
needed today and what's needed even

1027
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,859
going into the future you know this is

1028
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,270
this is these are the audience sizes for

1029
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:09,700
some of the larger events in the last

1030
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:13,540
few years and the actual delivered

1031
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:16,919
online events that you know already are

1032
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:21,190
well over this sort of high end

1033
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:25,210
achievable value for for a single

1034
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:28,360
provider for for 4k so obviously these

1035
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:32,080
these users are not receiving their

1036
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:35,700
traffic in 4k how long that will last is

1037
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:38,500
an exercise for the reader I guess so

1038
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:40,870
yeah but there's other problems also

1039
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,930
that are kind of worth going over and

1040
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:45,279
addressing you know some of the

1041
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,319
challenges that you encounter when

1042
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,070
you're doing a PR with segment transport

1043
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,650
how you know he run into how the network

1044
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,940
interoperates with with the player

1045
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,890
that's trying to perform bitrate

1046
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:00,700
detection and the kinds of effects that

1047
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:02,980
this causes some of some of the may be

1048
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:06,640
insights into network design that would

1049
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,020
make this easier or things that people

1050
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,520
should be aware of when they're trying

1051
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,670
to put together their network or their

1052
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:17,200
player and then the the various kinds of

1053
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:20,890
you know feedback driven streaming that

1054
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:24,040
the response to to feedback from the

1055
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:28,970
player there's also some space to talk

1056
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:30,230
about you know how to address

1057
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,310
conferencing what the latency

1058
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:37,280
requirements are the multi-directional

1059
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:38,570
options you know the the like what what

1060
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,940
is it going to look like in your network

1061
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:42,380
when you try to run these conferencing

1062
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,270
things and when they start to scale up

1063
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:48,290
when there's more people how he can

1064
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:51,619
maybe approach how to estimate how much

1065
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:54,050
to expect and likewise the pointer to

1066
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:56,510
the implementations like is this

1067
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,340
something we could maintain in the ITF

1068
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,230
is it would it be valued I think it

1069
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,270
would be valuable but you know there's

1070
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,980
some questions to answer as we do that I

1071
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,310
think it would be a valuable

1072
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:11,060
contribution for a working group to to

1073
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:13,580
address and then just where to go from

1074
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:17,200
there is I'm hoping for a feedback I'm

1075
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:21,410
hoping for I feel like the working group

1076
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:26,450
would be worthwhile but you know that's

1077
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:36,109
just me so questions comments questions

1078
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:37,460
people read draft I was just trying to

1079
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:39,109
write down as you were going there I can

1080
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,700
you can used to numerate really clearly

1081
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:41,810
for me one time the things you think the

1082
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:45,140
working group would actually do the

1083
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:49,369
views collect your like document I'm

1084
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:51,589
just trying to so this is the this is

1085
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:53,030
one of the documents I think I hope

1086
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:56,000
would be worthwhile

1087
00:53:53,030 --> 00:54:01,839
you know what problems do we encounter I

1088
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,430
think it would be I asked for

1089
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,020
maybe maybe I'd end up right I don't

1090
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:09,109
know but I would like to have a roadmap

1091
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:12,080
of of the various different video

1092
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:14,480
solutions I think that when I whenever I

1093
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,490
try to figure that out I just get

1094
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,280
confused I can spend a week on it and I

1095
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,779
still get confused so this has been a

1096
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,349
challenge for me I would love somebody

1097
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:31,119
to who kind of knows the space better to

1098
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:31,119
write that doc I think that there are

1099
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:36,939
there are

1100
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:40,479
you know we have a working group of

1101
00:54:36,939 --> 00:54:42,098
course for RTP when you go there then

1102
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:45,939
everybody is talking about all the video

1103
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:47,919
encodings and like when I want to you

1104
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:50,019
know get feedback on like well what do

1105
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:53,348
you do with multicast exactly and how

1106
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:55,029
does the network work then you know I

1107
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:56,649
can go to M Bundy and they don't know

1108
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:58,749
what I'm talking about video and

1109
00:54:56,649 --> 00:55:00,129
although they they can tell me all kinds

1110
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:02,169
of great stuff about routing but it's

1111
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:08,949
like there's a problem here that's about

1112
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:10,328
media that's about it's like we just had

1113
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:12,099
a little bit of that in the previous

1114
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:13,659
presentation from Justin right and they

1115
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:15,549
articulating on some of the different

1116
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:17,289
requirements of that kind of video are

1117
00:55:15,549 --> 00:55:21,249
whether it's you know differences in

1118
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:23,469
terms of the impact or availability of

1119
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:27,908
options for compression or whether it's

1120
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:29,979
you know differences in terms of how you

1121
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:31,599
know how much details matter so on and

1122
00:55:29,979 --> 00:55:33,339
so forth so there definitely are

1123
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,089
different classes of video it's not just

1124
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:39,819
like videos one big chunk of it yeah I'm

1125
00:55:37,089 --> 00:55:41,699
also wondering if there's any solutions

1126
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:46,089
that don't have a home yet that could

1127
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:48,219
get some review here and I mean I don't

1128
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:51,399
know like I don't know if HLS is in

1129
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:53,379
scope right but that is a informational

1130
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:55,359
draft it's almost like an external

1131
00:55:53,379 --> 00:55:57,249
standards body doing it that just

1132
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:00,159
doesn't exist but is posting the

1133
00:55:57,249 --> 00:56:02,618
information right so but but there's

1134
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:05,199
features that would be maybe valuable to

1135
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:07,239
have or not have in HLS and to get some

1136
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,889
review on that right is there a forum

1137
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:12,369
for kind of feeding that back and the

1138
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:13,959
same for - I don't know but I think

1139
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,639
getting consensus on some of the

1140
00:56:13,959 --> 00:56:19,509
questions about that like when a problem

1141
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:21,699
is presented you know maybe even just

1142
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:26,039
like statements that a liaison could

1143
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:26,039
make I feel like would be valuable

1144
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:33,158
Sanjay Mishra horizon so I think your

1145
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:36,459
document lays out the problem areas that

1146
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:39,189
needs to be looked at but any thoughts

1147
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:40,689
on how you want to drive your draft as

1148
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:43,348
to what are the specific areas you want

1149
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,348
to focus on

1150
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:50,880
so the hope is that it can be a you know

1151
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:53,130
given feedback from from the other

1152
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,380
experts you know more than I do in many

1153
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:58,170
cases that it can be a more or less

1154
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,570
complete kind of walkthrough of the

1155
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:02,910
currently understood challenges with

1156
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:09,150
delivering video over the Internet and

1157
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:13,109
within networks so I'm a where to focus

1158
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:15,150
I hope to avoid digging too far into how

1159
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:16,800
to solve the various problems and

1160
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:18,870
challenges although maybe pointing to

1161
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,720
the solutions to existing or the

1162
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:24,859
existing kind of approaches is

1163
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,950
worthwhile but identifying the areas of

1164
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:31,260
the that need for the research and that

1165
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:34,259
you know this that's kind of where I was

1166
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:37,140
hoping to take it you know if you have

1167
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,090
suggestions on a more more useful

1168
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:46,170
document that would be great all right

1169
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:49,920
thanks thanks Tony caliber Comcast I

1170
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:53,250
don't know you know I'm not sure oh well

1171
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,930
sidestep where this fits into ITIF that

1172
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:59,760
is an operator I think it's very useful

1173
00:57:54,930 --> 00:58:03,149
to have some you know well-defined in it

1174
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,750
and somewhat agreed-upon ideas of how to

1175
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:09,230
get these scaling numbers because to

1176
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:11,880
design networks that we need to do this

1177
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:13,740
everybody just kind of it's needed finds

1178
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,260
out themselves tight yet but somewhere

1179
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:24,439
else you know some documentation very

1180
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:27,390
good thank you so you disappoint a

1181
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,810
unique unique us problem many have

1182
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:34,109
millions of subscriber and 4k in a you

1183
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:36,450
know be a stream for any live broadcast

1184
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,920
so that may not work well we could

1185
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,680
consider you know hub and spoke model

1186
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,270
and I think some of the operator they

1187
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:47,819
seems to be suggesting that you know

1188
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:49,860
they won't have some way to deploy so

1189
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:52,590
look like it that means we capped it

1190
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,450
somewhere that's one thing so then

1191
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:56,790
another fundamental thing Steffan

1192
00:58:54,450 --> 00:59:01,200
multicast and 4k video

1193
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:04,560
you have a any network so you have to

1194
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,589
uniquely send traffic entry and even

1195
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:10,200
when there is a purple exchange so you

1196
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:13,830
should not you know overload the

1197
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,759
bandwidth utilization that doesn't need

1198
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,759
to be captured somewhere

1199
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:26,940
okay as like additions to the document

1200
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:29,490
you think these are new areas to that we

1201
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:32,370
may need to capture the stuff you media

1202
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:34,080
handling so I I don't know like where to

1203
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,460
capture so I'm just you know being the

1204
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:41,580
points

1205
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:43,140
yeah I I hope so I'm not sure the final

1206
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:47,790
text of the document but yeah I mean

1207
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:56,069
it's the intent would be to address some

1208
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:58,790
of these kinds of things yeah all right

1209
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,790
thank you thank you

1210
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,419
[Music]

1211
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:04,520
all right so hopefully that's given

1212
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:07,589
people an improved sense of sort of

1213
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:09,599
breadth and depth of problem space and

1214
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:13,560
potential interconnection points for the

1215
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:15,900
ITF what I'd like to do now is just to

1216
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,560
do a very quick overview of some of the

1217
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:21,420
material that we have put together for a

1218
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:24,569
draft charter for a potential working

1219
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,010
group I'm fine with doing some

1220
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:27,839
discussion of it in fact I'd like to do

1221
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,940
a little bit of discussion of it I don't

1222
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,040
want to get into wordsmithing because

1223
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,660
the at point of this exercise at this

1224
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,300
point is just to sort of say here's a

1225
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:38,190
straw proposal for the sort of thing we

1226
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,960
think might be doable as a working group

1227
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,730
and then we can have more substantive

1228
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,180
discussions about whether or not people

1229
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:46,800
feel that there is a ETF work to be done

1230
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,940
here and whether there's clarity and

1231
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,800
doing it and whether there are enough

1232
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:52,079
people involved to be able to do the

1233
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:57,359
work that seems like a reasonable

1234
01:01:52,079 --> 01:02:00,359
approach to people okay so the draft

1235
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,970
charter is available here you're welcome

1236
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:04,200
to quickly scribble that down or get it

1237
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:08,730
out of the slides and the meeting

1238
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:11,009
materials I will step through some of

1239
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:13,050
the chunks a bit by bit here first

1240
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:14,640
observation is that this this is not I

1241
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,470
mean charters are not rocket science we

1242
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,118
basically cobbled this together from

1243
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,799
previous work done for the mbone d--

1244
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:26,130
charter and for the v6 ops organ group

1245
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:27,839
charters yeah so this is the overview I

1246
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,250
think this is pretty much what we've

1247
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,328
been talking about in general in general

1248
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:34,920
round numbers here today that there's a

1249
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:36,869
lot of video going on in the internet

1250
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,760
there's a lot of video being worked on

1251
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:41,609
you know here as well as in other

1252
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,650
organizations it should it would be

1253
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:45,690
beneficial if we could get better

1254
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,030
coordination between those activities as

1255
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:49,650
well as awareness-raising of potential

1256
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:52,950
solutions of which people might not be

1257
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:54,990
aware and to do these things in a way

1258
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:58,319
that's actually sympathetic to the

1259
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:59,970
Internet's overall design so to that end

1260
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,130
the purpose of the working group would

1261
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:04,470
be to solicit input on operation

1262
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,809
issues and practices existing and

1263
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:08,669
proposed technologies related to the

1264
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:10,049
deployment engineering and operation of

1265
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:11,700
media streaming and manipulation

1266
01:03:10,049 --> 01:03:13,799
protocols and procedures in the global

1267
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:17,519
Internet inter domain and single domain

1268
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:21,450
networks so that's kind of an overview

1269
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:25,019
of where we think this this sort of

1270
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:27,808
thing lands I would take clarification

1271
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:29,788
questions or suggestions at this point I

1272
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:37,950
don't really want to get into hyper

1273
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:39,630
wordsmithing at this point so one of the

1274
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:42,299
common things we like to ask that the

1275
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:43,559
ITF is what problems it solved because

1276
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:45,390
we shouldn't do things if there's an

1277
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:47,970
apartment that it's neatly gonna

1278
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:49,890
contribute you one of the takeaways I

1279
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:52,169
found in the last few years working this

1280
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:55,410
problem space within the IHF and in

1281
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:57,599
other places like the SBA is that there

1282
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,609
seems to be is recurring problem and we

1283
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:02,180
saw it a little bit in the strata stuff

1284
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:05,339
right Chris destroys a theater where

1285
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,598
there's all these pieces and when you're

1286
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:07,859
trying to put them together to do

1287
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:09,299
something useful and you keep hitting a

1288
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:11,400
little roadblocks and little weird

1289
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:13,559
things in that particular piece as

1290
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,940
especially on boundaries between one

1291
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,329
piece and another piece are where

1292
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:20,279
another layer and when it comes to video

1293
01:04:18,329 --> 01:04:22,109
expertise of well why is that and what

1294
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:24,900
is it about video that exercises that

1295
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:28,109
particular boundary problem it needs

1296
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:30,509
work it's hard to find places to have

1297
01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:32,460
that conversation and it's also hard to

1298
01:04:30,509 --> 01:04:33,750
find expertise to solve that and one of

1299
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,700
the reasons we have those boundary

1300
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:38,609
problems and they get really exacerbated

1301
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,828
by video is the pure volumes of traffic

1302
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:42,390
that are sliding over our networks all

1303
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:44,460
the time so these little inefficiencies

1304
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:47,308
that we're willing to tolerate in other

1305
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:49,410
situations get exacerbated day in and

1306
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:51,930
day out by video and as we start doing

1307
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:53,940
things like streaming a full-blown 4k

1308
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,859
video for video games that will latency

1309
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,200
across the network we really just pound

1310
01:04:55,859 --> 01:05:01,140
the heck out of our protocols and so

1311
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,970
part of the idea that I hear and I see

1312
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:05,730
this in this draft overview is the

1313
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:07,919
notion of it's a place where people who

1314
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,200
understand that problem and are feeling

1315
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,509
that's that scaling issues and those

1316
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,859
frictions between the pieces you're

1317
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,990
putting the gallery to deliver a

1318
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,400
solution can

1319
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:18,830
that knowledge and experience back into

1320
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,680
the IDF find like-minded people read of

1321
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:23,089
the evil drafts call us that those ideas

1322
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,160
and those leads those wants and

1323
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:27,920
ultimately need to work on it within the

1324
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:30,080
group itself or feed those needs as they

1325
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,510
just stated and become you know

1326
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,910
well-thought-out feed them back into

1327
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:36,920
other areas of the ITF for them to tack

1328
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:43,009
on it have a really concrete problem for

1329
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:46,160
them to work on ok CableLabs so first of

1330
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:48,710
all i think i completely support the

1331
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,649
idea of having the there's enough work

1332
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:53,000
in here in terms of the i know you hope

1333
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:55,339
you don't want to do wordsmithing but

1334
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,230
this is a quick question so I like the

1335
01:05:55,339 --> 01:05:59,119
strictly White's is that it's about you

1336
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:00,800
know all things that are related to

1337
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,020
media which include video audio and

1338
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,430
other objects so which was one of the

1339
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:07,130
things I was going to talk about is that

1340
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:10,399
there's also more work that goes just

1341
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:12,560
beyond video in terms of immersive media

1342
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,180
or AR we are kind of technologies which

1343
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,000
are all related to the streaming thing

1344
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:20,299
would that also be something that can be

1345
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,170
brought in here if the needs are the

1346
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:25,849
same or similar I I think it's fair to

1347
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:33,520
say it's too soon to roll out of scope

1348
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:36,790
um yeah Justin just me buddy Google so

1349
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,599
like reading this like what I'm mostly

1350
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:41,000
interpreting this to mean is like we're

1351
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:43,849
gonna see how existing streaming

1352
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,400
protocols can be augmented by better

1353
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:49,520
interaction with the network and largely

1354
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,790
targeted toward network operators is

1355
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,680
that the right understanding I don't I

1356
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,300
don't think that was the intention I

1357
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,009
think it's more closer than to be that

1358
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,530
there really is video on the on the

1359
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,849
internet that's the operational part

1360
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,640
what are the things what are the issues

1361
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:06,040
that this that that is causing and how

1362
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,810
do we address them

1363
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,300
this group wouldn't be doing the new

1364
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:13,009
protocols if they are new protocols but

1365
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,570
it might do some legwork say you know

1366
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,609
there really are no protocols that

1367
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,560
currently do what we need there's not

1368
01:07:16,609 --> 01:07:20,450
something that we can adjust so how can

1369
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:24,820
we go off and do other work to do that

1370
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:27,710
so I think some existing protocols some

1371
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,900
potential for spinning up Newark

1372
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:32,059
or at least characterizing potential for

1373
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,740
new work okay that makes sense to me I

1374
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:35,510
think I just wanted to reinforce the

1375
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,118
point that Roberto made earlier which is

1376
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,319
that will basically have you know

1377
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:40,670
probably some new protocol work

1378
01:07:39,319 --> 01:07:42,410
happening and perhaps and some other

1379
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,150
group but then like that will actually

1380
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:45,730
have to be combined with how does that

1381
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:53,960
actually work with your network right

1382
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:56,329
sounds good cool yeah mess TOC limelight

1383
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,700
networks so I mean I think in general

1384
01:07:56,329 --> 01:08:02,180
this is this is interesting I mean one

1385
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:03,890
of the values that we've seen with

1386
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:06,078
stream video Alliance and and then

1387
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:08,690
potentially this is the you know there's

1388
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,619
the technology components and as Glenn

1389
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:12,170
mentioned there's all these different

1390
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:14,750
pieces but then there's everybody

1391
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:16,910
learning how to put all of those pieces

1392
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:19,460
together on their own and when you're

1393
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:22,790
dealing with scale and interoperability

1394
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:25,160
at scale you know everybody's choices

1395
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:28,069
when you've got ambiguity has impacts

1396
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:32,899
and ripples with everybody else and and

1397
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:36,469
often you've got that also in situations

1398
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:40,160
where we're all experts in a in a slice

1399
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:42,529
but you need to be able to have an

1400
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:45,318
opportunity to gauge feedback from

1401
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:48,259
different layers in the text stack or

1402
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:50,449
even you know silos and so I mean that's

1403
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:52,880
where I think the value in this kind of

1404
01:08:50,448 --> 01:08:55,790
a function is you know really it's that

1405
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,040
opportunity to say yeah this is this is

1406
01:08:55,790 --> 01:09:01,219
a good way to accomplish it it addresses

1407
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:03,710
these particular things and it's it's a

1408
01:09:01,219 --> 01:09:05,960
it's almost like a best practices if and

1409
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:08,540
and more but certainly best practices

1410
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,310
yeah and and I want to I was gonna

1411
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,469
comment on Glenn said it and that you

1412
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,449
sort of reinforced I'll comment now it's

1413
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:17,120
not I think just about inefficiencies

1414
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:18,649
and it's not just that you know when

1415
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,290
you're traveling at speed with video you

1416
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:24,139
you highlight inefficiencies I think

1417
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:28,040
that we've seen that some of the current

1418
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:30,109
uses a video and are challenging some of

1419
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,359
the assumptions that were made both in

1420
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:33,949
terms of you know network scaling

1421
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:38,509
setting up architecting your network to

1422
01:09:33,948 --> 01:09:40,608
to Tony's point and in terms of mean the

1423
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:41,420
actual protocols and compressions on and

1424
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:44,390
so forth

1425
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:47,260
give me one comment on that sorry for

1426
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,260
server jumping thank you

1427
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:52,279
one of the challenges I think that

1428
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:54,380
people sometimes don't get is that video

1429
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:56,450
on the Internet is is undergoing a

1430
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:58,550
constant evolution and and they look at

1431
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,830
something like you know be it we all be

1432
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:02,750
able look stream movies now for a few

1433
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,800
years and do it pretty well and that

1434
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,360
works pretty well you can say well

1435
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,860
there's no problems here it's his job

1436
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:12,049
was done came to my house j-jake chart

1437
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:14,030
kind of showed you know he was like way

1438
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:16,820
down the Nielsen tail for a show that

1439
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:18,349
you know isn't a popular show and it was

1440
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:20,630
consuming a tremendous amount of

1441
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:22,670
bandwidth for just doing that the number

1442
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:25,010
one shows and the big events way up on

1443
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:28,910
that chart we have a capacity hall we

1444
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:30,410
have a scalability call the world of

1445
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,389
video that they're transmitting to is

1446
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:34,820
changing right it's evolving from just

1447
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:36,530
being playback of movies which is a very

1448
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,330
simple experience is very linear I push

1449
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:41,240
the button i watch it it goes back it

1450
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:43,280
was the end to we're doing now live

1451
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,840
sports multi-camera live sports and not

1452
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,030
just professional stuff it's people

1453
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,920
themselves are streaming from the kids

1454
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:51,440
soccer game multiple multiple camera

1455
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,660
angles doctor grandma grandpa they're

1456
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,580
doing very sophisticated things in very

1457
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:57,380
high resolution formats right people are

1458
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:01,300
doing 4k people would 8k on the Internet

1459
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:03,380
the data volumes are ridiculous and so

1460
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,910
we're sort of this junction where I

1461
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,620
think where we've gone from media like

1462
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:08,330
1.0 which was sort of like your really

1463
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,860
simple basic stuff we did years ago we

1464
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,500
used to call multimedia remember back in

1465
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:14,450
those days and then we evolved to sort

1466
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,890
of this media 2.0 which we're sort of in

1467
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,570
right now which is I can play like a

1468
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:19,730
movie pretty reliably and a linear

1469
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:22,790
experience and I think we're on this

1470
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:24,860
cusp now of like media 300 where it's

1471
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:27,769
it's a much richer experience much

1472
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:29,990
richer data types much bigger volumes of

1473
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:32,090
data and people interacting with the

1474
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:33,889
media and more complex ways and that's

1475
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:35,990
gonna really start stressing and pushing

1476
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,960
the protocols and the boundaries and the

1477
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:40,040
network itself and that's what I framed

1478
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,890
I'm very excited about it because I

1479
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,240
think it's an interesting time to be and

1480
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:45,650
to see this evolution go on but it's

1481
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,889
also going to create some real

1482
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:51,440
challenges for IP networks and and

1483
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:53,430
that's why I think this work is kind of

1484
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,660
relevant to the IGF because

1485
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:57,390
were the place that does IP networks

1486
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:59,580
okay so I'm gonna cut the mics as they

1487
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:01,650
stand now and then we'll move on to the

1488
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,220
more of the Charter stuff so go ahead

1489
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:07,080
please

1490
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:11,310
so Stefan being tense and I would

1491
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:17,210
suggest to tighten the language there a

1492
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:22,830
little bit primarily to focus on the

1493
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:24,990
mass distribution of video rather than

1494
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:28,550
something as broad as this which

1495
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:31,050
arguably would cover things like like

1496
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:32,640
point-to-point video conferencing which

1497
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:33,890
has from and from an operational

1498
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,060
viewpoint to the best of my knowledge

1499
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:39,240
fundamentally different properties than

1500
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:41,750
mass distribution and I see Justin's

1501
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:47,070
point that there is some convergence

1502
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:53,280
about that they say that the protocols

1503
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:56,820
in use but still you you're you're

1504
01:12:53,280 --> 01:13:00,750
you're just having way too broad a scope

1505
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:03,120
I fear at the moment with this with this

1506
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,820
language so that's thank you for that

1507
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,890
point and I'm not sure that that's

1508
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:09,599
specifically the right way to tighten it

1509
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:12,120
but we can come back to that if we get

1510
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,520
to the point of words noting that thanks

1511
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:20,849
Titan any way you wish but yes

1512
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:23,580
don't keep it over the broad prepare to

1513
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:30,290
play on Google sorry

1514
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:33,630
now Facebook been a long time anyway I

1515
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:38,910
have similar fears this is very broad

1516
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:40,800
and I can give you a concrete case where

1517
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:42,210
I would try and figure out or rather I

1518
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,400
would have difficulty figuring out where

1519
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:47,970
this would go so let's say we create a

1520
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,700
partially reliable HTTP I think it's

1521
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:53,100
obvious that you can extend - etc and

1522
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,269
start in engine upon the things that

1523
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,940
we're currently doing with really low

1524
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:59,940
latency WebRTC etc with with such

1525
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:01,620
technology but you could also use it for

1526
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:03,509
games and you can also use it for

1527
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,740
regular object transmission you can use

1528
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,420
it at proxies for

1529
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,780
you know eliminating head-of-line

1530
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:12,400
blocking but not necessarily for video

1531
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:14,230
so I think that in order for this

1532
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,480
particular thing to be successful we

1533
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:21,280
have to have a really crystal clear idea

1534
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:23,589
of exactly what things land here and how

1535
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,990
they don't impinge upon activities in

1536
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:28,750
other places right so in that regard

1537
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:31,360
though I think again the the hope and

1538
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:33,160
expectation is that if stuff lands here

1539
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,920
it's largely from the standpoint of

1540
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:37,900
getting it vectored somewhere else so

1541
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,400
something like that did land here then

1542
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,320
hopefully there would be expertise there

1543
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:54,639
and say you really should take it to

1544
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:58,170
this working group yeah okay so it's

1545
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:02,170
partly like a dispatch function yeah

1546
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:03,910
okay so yeah goals as we have them

1547
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:05,580
listed again soliciting input from

1548
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:07,780
network operators and users to identify

1549
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:11,800
operational issues with media delivery

1550
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:14,200
in and across networks to solicit

1551
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,330
discussion and documentation always

1552
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,340
important of documentation of the issues

1553
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:20,559
and opportunities for media acquisition

1554
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:24,130
and delivery and of the resulting

1555
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:27,310
innovations so I mean all this really is

1556
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:30,010
again focused on the kinds of work that

1557
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:36,120
we envision doing here and you know some

1558
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:36,120
of which you've seen outlined today the

1559
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:43,630
yeah the only real potential area for

1560
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,250
development is point number six to

1561
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:47,290
develop tools extend protocols and

1562
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:49,270
provide operational and implementational

1563
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:51,480
advice that assists in media technology

1564
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,410
administration Diagnostics

1565
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,080
troubleshooting and deployment between

1566
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:57,370
and within native and non-native

1567
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:00,580
environments what a mouthful

1568
01:15:57,370 --> 01:16:02,800
again not wordsmithing here but the

1569
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:06,730
point being not it's not about

1570
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:10,480
developing new protocols so much as the

1571
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:15,709
best current practices and you know

1572
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:18,389
analysis Cohen

1573
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:22,100
all right so everyone's talking about

1574
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:26,940
the SVA on here representing the SVA

1575
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:29,790
yeah I think you know yeah sorry

1576
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:31,410
Jason t-bo's during video Alliance okay

1577
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:34,500
so what you guys are doing here is great

1578
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:36,210
right so as another organization that's

1579
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,310
focused on streaming video and best

1580
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:41,070
practices and guidelines and specs we

1581
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:42,330
really look to the IETF and SEM T for

1582
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:44,849
things like this right things are

1583
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:46,550
technology technological evoke astride

1584
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,570
there are lots of issues to resolve

1585
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:50,130
technology issues in the workflow like

1586
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:53,790
encoding and things like that but the

1587
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:57,060
IETF needs or is doing what it's focused

1588
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:58,679
on which is what I would say protocol

1589
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:00,390
development stack development

1590
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:02,429
operational development and things of

1591
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:04,650
that nature I think what we need to make

1592
01:17:02,429 --> 01:17:06,090
sure is that you know from my

1593
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:07,710
perspective from my organization's

1594
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:10,650
perspective that the IETF doesn't

1595
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:12,090
supplant or try to take over kind of

1596
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:13,920
what we're trying to do so we need to

1597
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:16,350
figure out how to work together to make

1598
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,580
sure that the IETF is focused on you

1599
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,530
know sort of the technological

1600
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:21,960
development that the SVA doesn't really

1601
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:24,150
focus on and at the same time allows us

1602
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,679
to remain sort of flexible to approach

1603
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:27,690
the things that we want to approach

1604
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,850
while you guys are doing you know really

1605
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:32,190
kind of the in the weeds development

1606
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:33,480
that is you know internet engineering

1607
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:37,500
which is again not something that the

1608
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:42,540
SVA is particularly germane to Thanks

1609
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:44,699
let me try this again : can you say a

1610
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:46,019
little bit more so I'm hooking on the

1611
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:48,480
developing new stuff here a little bit

1612
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:50,250
okay that that that edge of it so a lot

1613
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,410
of that is done with extending you say a

1614
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:53,730
little bit more about the BCPs in

1615
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:55,559
particular how you'd expect those to

1616
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:57,089
constrain other work that happen in the

1617
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,190
ITF because even though we use them like

1618
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,590
what type of things comes up there so I

1619
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:03,449
think the the notion there was best

1620
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:05,280
current practice in sort of the literal

1621
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:07,199
and not in the literal interpretation of

1622
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,440
the words and not sort of a now we're

1623
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,660
doing standards track stuff so for

1624
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,489
operators who have determined that here

1625
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:16,440
is a useful way to handle this type of

1626
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:19,530
traffic in our network here is our

1627
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:21,480
current practices for instance right

1628
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,800
okay now so not so much I think what

1629
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,900
you're i mean i am no problem with

1630
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,239
information alright you know advise me

1631
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,598
but things that are neither best neither

1632
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:31,329
current Noora practice

1633
01:18:28,599 --> 01:18:32,649
well yes no choice yeah okay so that's

1634
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:34,869
that's a fair point and definitely

1635
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:37,869
bookmarked for for clarifying the text I

1636
01:18:34,869 --> 01:18:39,699
it was not at least in my mind intended

1637
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:43,539
as a constraint on development of other

1638
01:18:39,699 --> 01:18:44,739
work so much as a capture I do think

1639
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:45,669
they probably are best and they probably

1640
01:18:44,739 --> 01:18:49,869
are current and they probably are

1641
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:50,858
practices but not BC piece I take any

1642
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:54,219
one of those three so it's still be

1643
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:55,419
worth publishing so okay and then on six

1644
01:18:54,219 --> 01:18:56,889
I mean when we start talking about I

1645
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:58,510
mean most of our work is actually done

1646
01:18:56,889 --> 01:19:00,849
like sending protocols not developing

1647
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:02,649
new protocols I mean III think that

1648
01:19:00,849 --> 01:19:04,719
that's some of the people's uncomforta

1649
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:06,219
most comes around that that type of

1650
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,829
space so anything you can try and say to

1651
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:11,469
to make this Charter narrower and

1652
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:13,268
crisper around what the scope is because

1653
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:14,859
right now I can't think of anything that

1654
01:19:13,269 --> 01:19:20,889
isn't in scope and that's never a good

1655
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:25,139
sign for a charter to me okay Ali Berg

1656
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:27,789
Bergen on jabbers a couple of comments

1657
01:19:25,139 --> 01:19:30,219
he wondered how many folks are in the

1658
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:32,499
room that are not regular IETF errs and

1659
01:19:30,219 --> 01:19:34,629
to make this working group is success

1660
01:19:32,499 --> 01:19:36,969
working closely and together with a

1661
01:19:34,629 --> 01:19:40,570
bunch of several other organizations is

1662
01:19:36,969 --> 01:19:43,179
a must so right so well to that point so

1663
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:45,969
we have we have JC a juice himself from

1664
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:47,949
the SVA something who was trying to be

1665
01:19:45,969 --> 01:19:50,949
here but had to go to a meeting in LA on

1666
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:52,808
some video stuff was the director Thomas

1667
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:54,249
files and Mason director of standards

1668
01:19:52,809 --> 01:19:55,929
that Cindy was also going to be here

1669
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:59,889
today unfortunately he happy go that way

1670
01:19:55,929 --> 01:20:03,219
instead of Montreal but the point being

1671
01:19:59,889 --> 01:20:05,349
is that there are there seems to be this

1672
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:07,479
ecosystem of people out there that

1673
01:20:05,349 --> 01:20:09,849
depend upon our stuff that have an

1674
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:13,059
interest in stuff producing in here at

1675
01:20:09,849 --> 01:20:14,199
the ITF and one of the friction points

1676
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:18,760
I've heard repeatedly for a lot of

1677
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:21,070
people is is finding a place to do that

1678
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,199
and where they go where they land and

1679
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:24,969
and where do they find other things to

1680
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:26,739
talk about like they're like-minded that

1681
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:28,359
share the problem space and that's part

1682
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:30,299
of what I personally found very

1683
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:32,530
frustrating to was hoping to find maybe

1684
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:34,539
mops could provide a landing place for

1685
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:36,759
some of those things to work on they're

1686
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:38,530
very very video specific but that will

1687
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:41,790
touch ultimately other things outside of

1688
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:48,240
the mobs there

1689
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:50,820
alyssa was next I think this is it's a

1690
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,440
helpful list it kind of mixes a few

1691
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,240
different things and I think when the

1692
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,799
community goes to evaluate the Charter

1693
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:58,639
if they do it might be useful to

1694
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:01,680
separate them out so one thing is like

1695
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,630
goals and exactly the dictionary

1696
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,010
definition sense but usually a Charter

1697
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:07,140
would it be a little bit more specific

1698
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:08,850
on like actual work items and this list

1699
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:10,530
kind of intersperses these right like

1700
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:12,420
which documents are you gonna work on or

1701
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:14,070
what kinds of documents as opposed to

1702
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,980
like what kind of discussion you're

1703
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:18,960
trying to to stimulate and I think

1704
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:22,019
separating those into like a specific

1705
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,820
like here's the work list versus like

1706
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,840
here's the here's the loftier goals

1707
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:30,269
might help ease the path for this one

1708
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,380
and similarly I think because the you

1709
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,910
know the mechanism that you have in the

1710
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,260
wharton group is the consensus mechanism

1711
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:35,820
it would be useful to understand like

1712
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,890
which of these things do you expect to

1713
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:40,950
be working group consensus kinds of

1714
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:43,620
outputs versus like number five which i

1715
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:45,090
assume is more like something that

1716
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,740
people who have been together here will

1717
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,510
do but it's not something where you need

1718
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:50,580
like the machinery of the working group

1719
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:52,470
to get it done so I think making that

1720
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:54,809
distinction can be helpful and then I

1721
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:56,550
would just echo Cohen's comment on on

1722
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:58,130
point number six like I want to know

1723
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:00,840
which protocol is you're extending

1724
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:04,020
because like that's kind of the point of

1725
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,610
the Charter is to scope that so if there

1726
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,810
are specific ones in mind like that's

1727
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:09,269
great and we'll make sure there's no

1728
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:10,530
overlap with other existing groups but

1729
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:13,770
if we don't know which ones those are

1730
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:15,780
then it's probably it's not really a

1731
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:16,980
scope limitation so it gets a little bit

1732
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,580
trickier I think from a chartering

1733
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:23,370
perspective

1734
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:25,860
sure thanks honey Nathan looks okay the

1735
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:28,800
number one I was wondering the users you

1736
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,809
mean content provider so you mean end

1737
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,840
user what was the meaning of users here

1738
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:36,930
and because I think both of them are

1739
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:39,360
applicable and I think that for number

1740
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:41,600
six I would expect to see I mean the

1741
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:45,059
Charter we'll have to see which other

1742
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:47,300
for forum for us are relevant for this

1743
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:49,770
work that we need to cooperate with

1744
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,780
stuff that it's not the only one I mean

1745
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:54,470
there are others that are doing working

1746
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,469
in this area

1747
01:22:55,199 --> 01:23:02,400
Stepan Vanga Alisa stole my thunder but

1748
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:04,590
in addition remove any mentioning of

1749
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:09,059
media acquisition don't make it too

1750
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:10,620
complex focus on the delivery one of the

1751
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,840
growing things especially from live

1752
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:14,610
screaming by individuals or even

1753
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:17,250
professionals well whatever it is we

1754
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:19,769
were doing it it's it's something's

1755
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:22,230
really growing as a demand on the

1756
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:25,140
network and so that's why acquisition

1757
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:28,049
was included when we wrote this so that

1758
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:30,300
it isn't just about pumping bits from a

1759
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:32,040
server to a viewer it's also about the

1760
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,110
capturing of the bits from the camera

1761
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,630
into the new system and science people

1762
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:38,969
or in the case of like the gaming space

1763
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:41,460
its actual you know the server pumping

1764
01:23:38,969 --> 01:23:43,830
out the video of the game and to look

1765
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:45,750
green at scale you know all others is

1766
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:48,090
understood but you you're just basically

1767
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:50,460
doubling your problem space because of

1768
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:52,620
the product route to use I just it's

1769
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:57,449
fundamentally different the requirements

1770
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:59,269
are different I think it's especially

1771
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:02,460
the live stream which is incredibly

1772
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:04,620
growing on the internet right we is that

1773
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:06,750
the two things go hand in hand

1774
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:09,269
and so I can see the argument for you

1775
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,320
separate them and divide and conquer the

1776
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,800
two of them have to work really well

1777
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,780
together

1778
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,670
and so putting them in one place so they

1779
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:18,330
can work well together and and as you

1780
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:20,040
develop the documents around them it

1781
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:21,420
makes it easier to work and coordinate

1782
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,650
that effort instead of splitting them up

1783
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:26,540
and making them sort of fend for

1784
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:26,540
themselves and not have any coordination

1785
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:33,239
or on kumari google so there was a

1786
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:35,190
question from the jabber about sort of

1787
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:37,468
how many people here are not regular

1788
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:39,239
IETF attendees like how many people came

1789
01:24:37,469 --> 01:24:41,280
in for this and I don't know if we ever

1790
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:43,139
actually heard an answer to that um

1791
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,730
could we do something a show of hands or

1792
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:47,010
a like how many people normally

1793
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:49,379
participate how many don't how many if

1794
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:52,830
this were to actually continue would

1795
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:54,360
stop participating etc do you want to do

1796
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:56,090
that right now or do you want to do that

1797
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:58,830
when we do general discussions of all

1798
01:24:56,090 --> 01:25:01,770
right so so I think the list of

1799
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:07,280
questions were first of all how many

1800
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:07,280
people here are not usual IETF attendees

1801
01:25:07,489 --> 01:25:12,178
okay

1802
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:13,980
sun-ok thank you and then of those how

1803
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:15,900
many came specifically for this or

1804
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:18,330
material like this how many people came

1805
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:23,099
because in part at least because of this

1806
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:24,300
Boff right so smaller smaller show of

1807
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:27,060
hands

1808
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,040
then the on the on word questions are if

1809
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:32,310
this if something like this if work in

1810
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:34,290
this area were was chartered how many

1811
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:35,280
would expect how many didn't just come

1812
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:36,869
to throw bananas

1813
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,730
how many would expect to continue to

1814
01:25:36,869 --> 01:25:40,949
attend and participate in the

1815
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:44,309
discussions and not just so the people

1816
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:47,030
who came are new here okay so I'm seeing

1817
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:50,159
about quarter to a third of the room are

1818
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:52,340
putting up their hands dead good enough

1819
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,339
for now

1820
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,730
when I look at the list of people are

1821
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,290
also on these boat attendees I do see a

1822
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:04,019
number of people who I know do not

1823
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:05,820
typically come to I get meetings so I'm

1824
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:07,889
not sure we count those but I see a lot

1825
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:09,570
of people taking the time to join me and

1826
01:26:07,889 --> 01:26:10,980
and I didn't I didn't get a sense from

1827
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,840
the me deco room because I can't see it

1828
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:14,549
from where I'm standing I think the

1829
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,440
other relevant question is how many from

1830
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:18,270
the people who go to the idea to also go

1831
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:20,190
to the other standard meeting that work

1832
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:24,420
with that because that's also it's the

1833
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:26,489
opposite side okay so how many people

1834
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:29,159
here in this room today go to other

1835
01:26:26,489 --> 01:26:31,980
media video related meetings on a

1836
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:33,629
regular basis alright okay so that's

1837
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:35,580
about as many people who said that they

1838
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:38,600
would continue to participate here so

1839
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,600
that sounds good thank you

1840
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:45,150
just one comment about the the issue of

1841
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:48,060
the live-streaming I think we are now in

1842
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:50,099
a live-streaming conference right okay

1843
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:55,290
so this is I assume this is something

1844
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:56,869
also we want to address but I don't

1845
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:59,790
think we're at quite the same number of

1846
01:26:56,869 --> 01:27:00,989
expected participants as Jake was

1847
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:09,860
outlining I think they could probably

1848
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:09,860
handle us go ahead

1849
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:19,519
media acquisition is or is not the same

1850
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:22,349
thing as ingestion or contribution

1851
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,440
acquisition has connotations of

1852
01:27:22,349 --> 01:27:26,699
things I can pay money and get a license

1853
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,888
for some content as opposed to

1854
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:30,239
distributing this might be wordsmithing

1855
01:27:28,889 --> 01:27:32,670
but it might not be worth smithing

1856
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:34,919
depending on your intent so I just want

1857
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:37,860
to bring this up that a definition of

1858
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:39,900
that is really important for what we're

1859
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:41,130
agreeing or disagreeing on that's your

1860
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:44,219
point and by the way it was not meant to

1861
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:45,989
be all that other stuff it's it's

1862
01:27:44,219 --> 01:27:47,310
getting the video not the the

1863
01:27:45,989 --> 01:27:48,869
boilerplate around running video

1864
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:51,530
ingestion services or anything like that

1865
01:27:48,869 --> 01:27:56,159
or authorizations

1866
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:59,009
that's even bigger kettle worms okay

1867
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:01,199
so thanks for that discussion and moving

1868
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:04,619
on to the next chunk of the the draft

1869
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:06,869
charter and for all of those points sort

1870
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:09,059
of is a global some global scoping rules

1871
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:10,980
we have the documents should document

1872
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,570
media operational experience including

1873
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,540
the global internet inter domain and

1874
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:17,519
within domain operations and that media

1875
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:20,130
operational and deployment issues with

1876
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,650
specific protocols or technologies are

1877
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:24,119
primarily are the primary

1878
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:26,280
responsibilities of the groups or areas

1879
01:28:24,119 --> 01:28:30,360
responsible for those protocols ie we're

1880
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:32,639
not trying to eat anybody's lunch so it

1881
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,710
might be useful for us to provide input

1882
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,449
to those other groups but again as

1883
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:38,639
somebody said earlier it's more like a

1884
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:41,219
dispatch function you know that's really

1885
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:42,989
interesting you should go here or let's

1886
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:45,030
work on the problem statement and we can

1887
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:56,848
ship it over to a different working

1888
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:57,900
group comments or thoughts here Chris

1889
01:28:56,849 --> 01:29:00,780
lemons from Comcast

1890
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:03,480
there are ship it off to another working

1891
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:07,349
group is particularly interesting to me

1892
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:11,129
we've got whenever you put together a

1893
01:29:07,349 --> 01:29:13,650
bunch of a bunch of protocols components

1894
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:16,139
what have you a lot of times you

1895
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:19,170
discover in fact that Sanjay mentioned

1896
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:21,270
it in his presentation from the SVA you

1897
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:24,110
discover places where you need extension

1898
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:27,570
points to hook them together and so

1899
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:29,848
making sure that we send off that those

1900
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:33,000
extension point works to the appropriate

1901
01:29:29,849 --> 01:29:36,540
working groups is I think going to be

1902
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:41,260
vital to the functioning we

1903
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:44,800
Thanks um and then the additional

1904
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:49,570
constraints just that this is stuff the

1905
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:51,370
ad made us put in no um that yeah there

1906
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:53,049
is some hope to have scope and and

1907
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:55,269
tightness of scope in the working group

1908
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:57,220
and future you know extending that scope

1909
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:59,980
is a it would require for a discussion

1910
01:29:57,220 --> 01:30:01,540
and if we don't actually continue to

1911
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:03,070
meet and discuss this stuff then we

1912
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:05,820
clearly don't have any work to do and we

1913
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:05,820
should just stop it

1914
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:17,770
Lenny Giuliano juniper I'm also the

1915
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:18,880
co-chair of M own D so hopefully it's

1916
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:29,530
one of the working groups you guys

1917
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:37,720
envision coordinating with we actually

1918
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:41,080
have license that so so overall the the

1919
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:44,290
proposed text for each of the items is

1920
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,820
you know pretty vague and covers I think

1921
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:49,360
it was pretty well so it could cover

1922
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:51,130
everything so you know I think would be

1923
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:53,400
good to have a little more specificity

1924
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:57,280
because it just seems like a cover

1925
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:59,620
between the Charter and the goals seems

1926
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:01,239
like it covers everything and as I read

1927
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:03,130
it it's still not clear to me what it is

1928
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:04,900
if I didn't know that I was in here and

1929
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:07,989
saw everything else I I wouldn't know

1930
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:10,540
what this group did but then you know

1931
01:31:07,989 --> 01:31:13,150
it's not obvious to an outsider what

1932
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:15,519
exactly and specifically as the problems

1933
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:18,400
we trying to solve but overall I would

1934
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:22,840
express a lot of you know I think this

1935
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:25,059
is a great effort a very useful effort

1936
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,820
as Jake has said there seems to be

1937
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:29,830
different kind of a Tower of Babel

1938
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:31,360
problem where the network guys don't

1939
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:33,040
quite understand the video stuff the

1940
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,259
video guys don't quite understand the

1941
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,870
network stuff but we are thinking that

1942
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,610
we are coming up with requirements or

1943
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:43,030
solutions for each other that may or may

1944
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:45,849
not be useful so a coordinating role by

1945
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:47,469
this working group would by by a working

1946
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:49,840
group like this would be very valuable

1947
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:52,860
and you know for just

1948
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:56,139
for example in in Bondi we have been

1949
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:58,089
it's it's not your your your father's

1950
01:31:56,139 --> 01:32:01,060
multicast working group anymore we've

1951
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:03,670
been trying to update things to get rid

1952
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:08,560
of parts of the architecture that are

1953
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:11,290
not very useful and make the world safe

1954
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,880
for multicast and we would love to have

1955
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:17,110
more feedback from groups like this to

1956
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,369
say if this is useful if this was if the

1957
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:21,009
work we're doing is worthwhile because

1958
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:24,549
we're trying to do it for groups like

1959
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:26,739
folks like you so I would I would hope

1960
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:29,260
that and likewise we would love to hear

1961
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:30,940
and better understand the challenges and

1962
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:35,320
the things you're looking for from the

1963
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:36,940
network and so I think this is great

1964
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,980
work I would love to and you know we

1965
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:40,960
have a meeting Thursday we would love to

1966
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:42,280
you know invite you guys if you want to

1967
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,469
speak to our working group to give an

1968
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:46,090
update about this effort and create a

1969
01:32:44,469 --> 01:32:48,280
little bit more awareness thank you

1970
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:51,849
thanks thanks the point you raised about

1971
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:55,599
it being very broad is is this we have

1972
01:32:51,849 --> 01:32:57,699
this icon of me it's the the challenges

1973
01:32:55,599 --> 01:33:00,790
that it touches video touches everything

1974
01:32:57,699 --> 01:33:04,480
in the network it touches routing

1975
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:05,830
transport package every little piece

1976
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,959
every almost every workgroup I mean

1977
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:10,540
recently people were coming to be asking

1978
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,590
for you know help with time stuff and I

1979
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:13,780
thought well I thought time had been

1980
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:16,510
sort of settled years ago and bam it's

1981
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:18,219
back in droves and so far the channel

1982
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:21,429
trash and we try to face and writing

1983
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:24,130
this stuff is that it's how to capture

1984
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:25,599
the fact that it really does package all

1985
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:28,060
the pieces that we do with the IETF

1986
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:30,239
together to do the work it does so the

1987
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:33,280
answer is well what's in it everything

1988
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:34,750
isn't it what's you know but where's the

1989
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,030
scoby where's the limit there well it's

1990
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:38,739
around video it's everything's in it but

1991
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:40,750
it's it's specifically limited to what

1992
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:42,369
you use those things to do for video so

1993
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:44,020
so I'm gonna say the same thing from a

1994
01:33:42,369 --> 01:33:45,670
slightly different perspective I think

1995
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,710
that part of our challenges we have a

1996
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:49,389
very broad catchment area even though I

1997
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:50,710
certainly take the point that you know

1998
01:33:49,389 --> 01:33:52,690
in order to be a working group that can

1999
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:55,060
get work done and make progress on it we

2000
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:58,019
need some pretty specific focuses and

2001
01:33:55,060 --> 01:34:00,880
deliverables and you know concrete stuff

2002
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:02,890
I think part of what you get out of

2003
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,050
focus in mbone D and

2004
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:07,480
six ops and DNS ops and all these other

2005
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:09,550
things is its protocol and what we're

2006
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,139
gonna do with it operationally we don't

2007
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:12,970
have one specific protocol that we're

2008
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,880
talking about and that's a challenge I

2009
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:17,620
mean initially I was resistant to the

2010
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,060
idea of a proposal of having an ops

2011
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:21,880
working group for this stuff because I

2012
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:24,040
think it really is and remains more of

2013
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:27,250
an interest group type thing across area

2014
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:29,530
thing you know whatever it's not really

2015
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:32,800
a working group per se not really a

2016
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:33,820
research group either but but the IETF

2017
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,280
just doesn't really have the right

2018
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:37,990
structure for that kind of a thing so

2019
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:40,120
we're trying to make this we're trying

2020
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:41,740
to you know get this shaped properly so

2021
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:44,050
that we can get some of the work done in

2022
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:46,599
the context of an ops working group so I

2023
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:48,880
think the point is really valid but I'm

2024
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,110
just articulating this is this is what

2025
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,700
we've been struggling with and this is

2026
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:55,420
why it sort of looks a little bit like a

2027
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:57,160
dog's breakfast because it's you know we

2028
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:59,470
can't say it's specific protocol and

2029
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:03,040
operational issues related to it it's

2030
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:05,710
this stuff and operational relay issues

2031
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:08,650
related to it so help appreciate it

2032
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:10,690
sure well I think what you just said it

2033
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:13,000
compasses everything I think that's

2034
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:15,040
that's as clear of you know explanation

2035
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,580
for you know what this group could be

2036
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:21,820
doing and and maybe more you know text

2037
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:24,809
around that that makes it clear what

2038
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:28,360
you're trying to do and why you exist

2039
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:30,220
looking at the text as it is now I if I

2040
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:33,460
wasn't in this room for 90 minutes I

2041
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:35,200
wouldn't know yeah I mean we can do some

2042
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:37,390
rewriting and sort of non stilted

2043
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:44,460
language and then bash it until it is

2044
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:46,990
still thin enough okay all right Jake

2045
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:50,620
yeah Jake Allen just a clarifying

2046
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:52,660
question to the people who have

2047
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:56,080
expressed a concern over the breadth of

2048
01:35:52,660 --> 01:36:00,519
scope is would it satisfy their concerns

2049
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:04,990
if it just had sort of a it must be tied

2050
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:07,120
to media delivery I mean like that is

2051
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:09,730
the that is the key point that we're

2052
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:13,960
trying to address but like Lesley said

2053
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:15,839
it you know video video and media if you

2054
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:18,990
think of point cloud or something right

2055
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:21,240
are getting headshakes it doesn't look

2056
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:26,880
for people doesn't do it for everyone

2057
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:28,469
anyway so it does get into every part of

2058
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,170
it and there are solutions for video

2059
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:33,720
that touch on routing so is it like or

2060
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:35,640
on transport is this something that can

2061
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:39,660
be addressed by just saying the focus

2062
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:49,620
has to be on the solving a video problem

2063
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:53,750
of some sort start with you mean my

2064
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:56,280
Roberto one of my problems here is that

2065
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:57,810
the things that I do to solve video are

2066
01:36:56,280 --> 01:37:01,920
exactly the things I do to solve other

2067
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:03,780
domains so if I want to solve gaming for

2068
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,240
instance and I'm not talking about the

2069
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:08,610
display part coming back right but just

2070
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:11,190
game state it has exactly the same

2071
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:13,589
properties as video it is potentially

2072
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:15,629
stateful I need compression I need to

2073
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:18,690
distribute it I need low latency I need

2074
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:20,310
time in almost every regard except for

2075
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:23,280
the fact that I'm generating pixels it

2076
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:25,650
is the same and so this is the suite of

2077
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:27,929
technologies that I would develop are

2078
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:29,490
going to be very similar if not the same

2079
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:33,450
at least in terms of the stack that

2080
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:35,070
we're dealing with here would that fall

2081
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:36,300
out of this group or in this group is if

2082
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:38,400
the fell out of the group that would be

2083
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,680
a little sad mm-hmm because it's exactly

2084
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:42,120
the same in technologies right but if it

2085
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,530
falls in the group it's also kind of

2086
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:45,510
difficult because what is the breadth

2087
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:47,610
again yeah no I hear what you're saying

2088
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:50,400
and I think I have about the same

2089
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:53,509
reaction in it I certainly appreciate

2090
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:58,049
the desire for crispness and focus but

2091
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:59,520
and not current well it's not just you

2092
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:01,260
can't boil the ocean it's it's that we

2093
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,900
haven't found the right cross-cutting

2094
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:06,780
way to articulate what it is it's in an

2095
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:07,830
inner out and I don't think I'm gonna

2096
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:10,139
get its ending here at the mic

2097
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:12,320
microphone if anybody sees a lightning

2098
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:15,570
bolt come down from the sky hallelujah

2099
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:17,639
but in the meantime I do think that it's

2100
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:20,429
worth at least getting some sense of the

2101
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:22,830
room these are the questions from RC

2102
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:25,200
54-34 that are guidance for whether or

2103
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:28,170
not we are ready to propose a working

2104
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:29,519
group I certainly understand from the

2105
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,930
discussion we've had so far

2106
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,730
we don't have a charter that people are

2107
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:36,360
willing to hum on but I think that there

2108
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:38,910
are two separable general questions one

2109
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:40,620
which is you know do people think

2110
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:42,720
there's something here that the IDF

2111
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:44,370
should be working on and the second one

2112
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:46,770
is you know should we be forming a

2113
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:48,570
working group will probably say

2114
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:50,160
primarily focused on the first part

2115
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:52,410
today

2116
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,590
because there's more more than then

2117
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:58,710
we're tweaking to do for the second part

2118
01:38:54,590 --> 01:39:00,840
so just in general around numbers and I

2119
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:04,620
guess we can start with a hum and then

2120
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:06,960
and then have some microphone time do

2121
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:08,550
people here feel that there that there

2122
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,170
is a problem that needs solving in the

2123
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:16,970
ITF is the right group to attempt

2124
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:20,420
solving it so go for a hum for yes and

2125
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:26,490
go for hum for No

2126
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:28,800
all right that's good news oh that

2127
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:30,840
question is very interesting I know I

2128
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,060
can prepare my problem is is I don't

2129
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:34,770
think if we ask these people what the

2130
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,600
problem is that needs to be solved they

2131
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:40,080
can articulate it that's that's the

2132
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:41,640
essence of every presentation today so I

2133
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,710
agree there's a problem of easily solved

2134
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,420
right yeah I don't know we've

2135
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:49,920
articulated it yeah yeah I think that's

2136
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:52,020
a small to-do list sort of an indicator

2137
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,640
that there's a problem that that there's

2138
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:56,280
a lot there's a sort of a common theme

2139
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:57,780
here it's it's video video video I'm

2140
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,730
touching all these things and I've got

2141
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:03,599
bandwidth problems I've got protocol

2142
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:05,129
frustrations and and at some point the

2143
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,260
trying to bring that that energy

2144
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:09,660
together to do productive work just

2145
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,980
sighs I would totally say let the

2146
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:12,510
problem to me is that we have many

2147
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:13,830
complicated things there's no expert

2148
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:15,360
single one we need a common place that

2149
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:16,740
brings all those people to talk about

2150
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,269
their different technologies together

2151
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:19,620
and they don't need to produce anything

2152
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,940
usually talked about right that's the

2153
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:23,490
problem to be sure that's not the

2154
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:25,230
problem to everyone else in the room but

2155
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:27,929
clearly there's a problem I mean

2156
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:30,209
obviously movie you know well well I'm

2157
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:32,310
glad you say it's obvious because I'm

2158
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:35,010
I'm using this meeting to put a stake in

2159
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:36,810
the ground to say that it is obvious

2160
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:38,370
because prior to this not necessarily

2161
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:43,790
being clear to everyone that there is a

2162
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:43,790
an IETF workable problem here so

2163
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:49,360
the next standard question from 54-34 is

2164
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:51,099
do we believe that there is a critical

2165
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,509
mass of participants willing to work on

2166
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:54,280
the problem to write drafts blah blah

2167
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:56,080
blah that's a little harder to answer

2168
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:58,030
given that we may all be thinking about

2169
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,950
different problems at this moment but I

2170
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:03,519
think a legitimate question to ask at

2171
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:05,559
this point is are there people who

2172
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,360
envision that they would be willing to

2173
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,760
not just attend the meetings but read

2174
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,290
the mailing list and help write drafts

2175
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,750
as they came along in Jake's already

2176
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:17,980
ahead of ahead of us he's got a proposed

2177
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:21,010
internet draft and some text so the

2178
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:23,230
question to back it up is and I think

2179
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:26,670
this will be a show of hands one rather

2180
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:28,900
than a hum who here would be willing to

2181
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:32,310
participate in the mailing list and

2182
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:35,860
possibly write some drafts in this area

2183
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:44,080
all right so I'm seeing a good dozen

2184
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:47,440
hands anyway so we all right

2185
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:51,040
closer to 20 hands so I think that

2186
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:54,339
there's there's there's interest

2187
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,110
there's willingness and I think the next

2188
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:57,490
thing to do because I don't think that I

2189
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,690
don't think anybody here is gonna agree

2190
01:41:57,490 --> 01:42:01,269
that the scope of the problem is well

2191
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:03,580
defined and understood let alone though

2192
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:07,960
there is agreement which we've

2193
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:12,580
articulated none are the right ones so I

2194
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:16,870
think the go ahead well just narrowing

2195
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:19,930
scope and Leni Giuliano from juniper is

2196
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:23,980
there is it video or is it media meaning

2197
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:28,570
is there non video media that this group

2198
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:30,280
is looking to coordinate it's not one no

2199
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:32,559
should it or should it just be video and

2200
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:36,009
videos tangentially

2201
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:40,990
what do you call games what do you call

2202
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:42,490
game stuff right is that video is it if

2203
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:46,420
it's interactive is it meteor is it

2204
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:50,260
video I'm sorry what was it games yeah

2205
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:54,810
about games well if it's if it has video

2206
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:57,930
I would call it video so in yeah so

2207
01:42:54,810 --> 01:43:02,700
I think it's audio-video oh yeah what

2208
01:42:57,930 --> 01:43:04,740
I'm saying is yeah video and with its

2209
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:08,269
you know so I think part of the

2210
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:11,099
challenge is audio comes with it is that

2211
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:13,350
I'm not sure that it's it's a helpful

2212
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:15,540
distinction try to say is it video or is

2213
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:17,160
it media because anytime you touch video

2214
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:18,660
it's probably encased in some kind of

2215
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:23,639
media delivery or some piece of it is

2216
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:25,650
media this is really simple I think I I

2217
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:33,060
don't want to wordsmith and give give

2218
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:35,309
names but the problem is not recent 23.1

2219
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:38,250
four point three kilobits per second

2220
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:41,340
speech codec stream and the problem is

2221
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:44,220
also not 100 kilobits per second AAC

2222
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,440
audio stream the problem are these multi

2223
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:49,380
Multi multi make up eight streets yeah

2224
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:51,330
and those are so the problem is multi

2225
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:53,490
megabit streams that may or may not have

2226
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:55,410
said the same characteristics and

2227
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:57,240
expectations as the previous multi

2228
01:43:55,410 --> 01:43:59,070
megabit streams that we had and in that

2229
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:01,170
in that light it becomes media more than

2230
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:02,549
necessarily specifically video that's

2231
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:07,470
some of what I got out of what Justin

2232
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:12,750
presented but but what I meant is we can

2233
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:16,590
I think reasonably say it's the problem

2234
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:18,840
is this video stuff compressed samples

2235
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:21,810
and entirely too many compressed samples

2236
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,610
right and how they were created and

2237
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:28,560
whether they are bundled with audio or

2238
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:32,160
not yeah it's multi megabit is a Cronus

2239
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:33,600
type of stuff so the point is I think

2240
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:35,160
what you're trying to say is if I can

2241
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,370
play it back is that the little tiny

2242
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:40,740
bits that's all this is about the big

2243
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:41,970
chunky things that are really hard to

2244
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:43,590
manage that are stressing the

2245
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:45,990
infrastructure and stressing the

2246
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:49,290
protocols and to get back to the video

2247
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:51,860
immediate question so media sometimes is

2248
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:54,269
just lovely catch-all sort of refer to

2249
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,710
both the video and the audio and all the

2250
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:57,930
little bits of pieces I get packaged

2251
01:44:55,710 --> 01:45:01,710
round even if it's data objects it's the

2252
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:03,530
about media videos a piece of the media

2253
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:06,450
does that make sense

2254
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:07,710
it's some it's a conceptual thing to get

2255
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,409
your head wrapped around but sort of

2256
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,789
what

2257
01:45:08,409 --> 01:45:12,159
a lot of people talk about media all

2258
01:45:09,789 --> 01:45:19,419
times so maybe we should just call the

2259
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:21,638
big unexpected data Operations Group so

2260
01:45:19,419 --> 01:45:23,979
Justin I think you refer yeah Justin

2261
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:26,829
Uberti Google I guess I think a bunch of

2262
01:45:23,979 --> 01:45:28,179
big data blobs like might not be quite

2263
01:45:26,829 --> 01:45:30,579
the same problem like you know

2264
01:45:28,179 --> 01:45:32,199
background file copies could conceivably

2265
01:45:30,579 --> 01:45:34,058
fall under that lens and that's a

2266
01:45:32,199 --> 01:45:36,009
totally different type of problem but

2267
01:45:34,059 --> 01:45:39,039
just to try to maybe added up to what

2268
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:42,099
Stefan was saying that this is you not

2269
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:43,179
you know small audio void streams but I

2270
01:45:42,099 --> 01:45:44,889
don't think we should paint ourselves

2271
01:45:43,179 --> 01:45:46,360
into a corner with a video what other

2272
01:45:44,889 --> 01:45:48,669
example are you might want to consider

2273
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:51,039
is that this is a point cloud coming

2274
01:45:48,669 --> 01:45:53,530
from a lidar array on a vehicle that's

2275
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:57,009
being remotely operated by a you know

2276
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:59,530
driver sitting in some data center so so

2277
01:45:57,010 --> 01:46:00,999
college days I just say not I was

2278
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:03,699
arguing scope it down here but decide to

2279
01:46:00,999 --> 01:46:05,559
boil the ocean so all the things though

2280
01:46:03,699 --> 01:46:08,829
Justin's talking about may be you know

2281
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:10,449
20 megabits streams and ah right but you

2282
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:13,599
have all exactly the same problems the

2283
01:46:10,449 --> 01:46:15,428
same issues when you're running 256

2284
01:46:13,599 --> 01:46:18,249
kilobits streams of video in a stadium

2285
01:46:15,429 --> 01:46:20,139
over a wireless network and 40,000

2286
01:46:18,249 --> 01:46:22,179
people all simultaneously stream the

2287
01:46:20,139 --> 01:46:23,590
same game it's exactly the same problems

2288
01:46:22,179 --> 01:46:25,570
you'd want to be able to discuss that

2289
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:27,639
type of stuff and you know there's

2290
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:28,959
12,000 satellites coming that are all

2291
01:46:27,639 --> 01:46:30,789
going to change our idea of what

2292
01:46:28,959 --> 01:46:32,110
networks we need to work across very

2293
01:46:30,789 --> 01:46:32,679
soon and it's gonna be a different bit

2294
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:34,808
what's out there

2295
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:40,269
okay soon too soon so earlier wouldn't

2296
01:46:34,809 --> 01:46:43,419
rated by bandwidth 7-7 earlier suggested

2297
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:47,110
that we talked about mass video delivery

2298
01:46:43,419 --> 01:46:48,159
and would your 256 kilobits is different

2299
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:52,869
depending on what network you're on

2300
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:54,159
right sorry Matt but it's so sweet Ben

2301
01:46:52,869 --> 01:47:01,509
right because it depends on the G and

2302
01:46:54,159 --> 01:47:06,478
the gravitational constant right sorry

2303
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:09,119
I'm all routers Jake Owen I just

2304
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:11,459
I just wanted to say that it's not just

2305
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:13,289
about the size of the stream it's also

2306
01:47:11,459 --> 01:47:16,619
about the latency requirements on that

2307
01:47:13,289 --> 01:47:21,989
okay yeah yeah real-time requirements

2308
01:47:16,619 --> 01:47:24,509
yeah okay yes so so maybe mass media

2309
01:47:21,989 --> 01:47:26,789
operation that there's to give this

2310
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:28,559
sense of its about volume not just you

2311
01:47:26,789 --> 01:47:29,610
know one single stream that's going from

2312
01:47:28,559 --> 01:47:31,050
one place to another

2313
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:34,289
yeah may be large or may be small but

2314
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:37,349
concept of mass yeah so I I resisted

2315
01:47:34,289 --> 01:47:39,800
that earlier in but I think that it may

2316
01:47:37,349 --> 01:47:44,090
be the better path to refine because it

2317
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:44,090
it helps define what that scope is

2318
01:47:45,019 --> 01:47:52,229
higher all this time Google without

2319
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:56,900
consulting with Justin and I think we

2320
01:47:52,229 --> 01:48:01,170
shouldn't think about defining a term

2321
01:47:56,900 --> 01:48:04,920
let's call it foo we might actually use

2322
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:08,249
video or that no video data well which

2323
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:12,030
is that we want to transfer stuff that

2324
01:48:08,249 --> 01:48:15,449
contains at least a video component may

2325
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:19,380
contain other components and has some

2326
01:48:15,449 --> 01:48:22,829
kind of timing constraints on its

2327
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:29,090
delivery I think if we define such a

2328
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:31,469
term we at least can use that term in

2329
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:35,519
the rest of the Charter

2330
01:48:31,469 --> 01:48:38,190
because constraints on timing of

2331
01:48:35,519 --> 01:48:40,979
delivery and the fact that it's video

2332
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:42,808
and therefore grows big are both

2333
01:48:40,979 --> 01:48:45,869
important parts of the problems that are

2334
01:48:42,809 --> 01:48:49,739
represented here okay sounds like an

2335
01:48:45,869 --> 01:48:55,860
important first draft ID I don't think

2336
01:48:49,739 --> 01:48:57,449
he was volunteering but Sanjay Sanjay

2337
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:59,598
mission Verizon so I think we've already

2338
01:48:57,449 --> 01:49:02,129
hit a lot of points about you know

2339
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:04,079
sharpening the focus so I I don't need

2340
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:06,300
to say anything more on that but really

2341
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:09,268
it's not the use cases that keep coming

2342
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:11,639
up and something that I know within the

2343
01:49:09,269 --> 01:49:14,789
SVA we are looking at virtual reality

2344
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:15,989
and to end delivery and there are issues

2345
01:49:14,789 --> 01:49:18,050
that come up whether in some other

2346
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:20,218
things that need to go into the SRTP

2347
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:22,739
right about the measurements

2348
01:49:20,219 --> 01:49:25,110
so that you have an interim sense of how

2349
01:49:22,739 --> 01:49:27,388
you're delivering me so those are the

2350
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:29,429
issues that would come up so we're not

2351
01:49:27,389 --> 01:49:30,800
there yet but I know that we're going to

2352
01:49:29,429 --> 01:49:35,189
be heating against some of these issues

2353
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:37,469
because but that's a protocol you know

2354
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:39,869
SRTP needs to be looked at whether it's

2355
01:49:37,469 --> 01:49:42,119
really how do I where do I go with my

2356
01:49:39,869 --> 01:49:44,489
measurements there are many places to go

2357
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:46,110
on that and what we're measuring so some

2358
01:49:44,489 --> 01:49:48,478
of those issues are the ones that we

2359
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:52,949
would probably be bringing up here and

2360
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:56,150
latency for VRS really right it and and

2361
01:49:52,949 --> 01:49:56,150
compression is a whole other thing

2362
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:06,419
[Music]

2363
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:09,300
when we're framing this problem I'm

2364
01:50:06,419 --> 01:50:12,349
hearing a lot of people articulating

2365
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:15,570
ideas about what we think it should be

2366
01:50:12,349 --> 01:50:19,139
what stuff is in scope we're all trying

2367
01:50:15,570 --> 01:50:21,929
to you know annex some scope it might be

2368
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:24,449
most useful if we start to the you know

2369
01:50:21,929 --> 01:50:26,519
when we take you to the list or continue

2370
01:50:24,449 --> 01:50:28,199
a conversation we think clearly about

2371
01:50:26,519 --> 01:50:30,389
some specific things that we're gonna

2372
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:32,159
declare out of scope for example

2373
01:50:30,389 --> 01:50:35,880
somebody asked me when we came here so

2374
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:39,239
so is this about telephony right is a

2375
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:40,769
telephone call in scope and I think

2376
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:42,209
there might be some people in the room

2377
01:50:40,769 --> 01:50:44,880
that are thinking well yeah obviously

2378
01:50:42,209 --> 01:50:46,469
clearly it's media and it's being

2379
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,869
transmitted and has latency requirements

2380
01:50:46,469 --> 01:50:50,429
and other people are saying no these are

2381
01:50:48,869 --> 01:50:52,679
small things that the solved probably

2382
01:50:50,429 --> 01:50:57,169
don't need to include that and so

2383
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:59,729
clearly defining what's not in scope

2384
01:50:57,169 --> 01:51:04,079
taking you know scope and saying that's

2385
01:50:59,729 --> 01:51:06,510
not there that may be a more a more a

2386
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:09,389
one of the useful approaches we can take

2387
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:11,249
ok thanks : being alerted on in scope

2388
01:51:09,389 --> 01:51:12,659
otherwise just in case anybody wants to

2389
01:51:11,249 --> 01:51:14,340
breathe I'm surprised nobody on to the

2390
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:16,799
microphone and ask that codecs are not

2391
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:18,419
we're never considered visioning and

2392
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:23,610
working group called thrust whether or

2393
01:51:18,419 --> 01:51:25,769
not the things fly repaired to pay on

2394
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:28,380
Facebook I just wanted to throw out a

2395
01:51:25,769 --> 01:51:30,869
couple things that I haven't heard but I

2396
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:33,030
think are implied which is that what

2397
01:51:30,869 --> 01:51:33,808
we've been talking about our stateful

2398
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:36,210
things

2399
01:51:33,809 --> 01:51:38,460
that they are consumed in real time

2400
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:39,989
whether or not that real time is you

2401
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:41,670
know 10 seconds for an hour whatever it

2402
01:51:39,989 --> 01:51:44,699
doesn't really matter and their session

2403
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:46,079
based when I watch a video it doesn't

2404
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:47,638
matter if it's many small carts or

2405
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,619
anything like that it tends to go

2406
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:51,420
together if it's a game again it doesn't

2407
01:51:49,619 --> 01:51:53,250
matter if it's made from anything send

2408
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:54,809
by many people it's what part of one

2409
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:56,159
session I'm just trying to throw this

2410
01:51:54,809 --> 01:52:00,030
out here in the case that this is

2411
01:51:56,159 --> 01:52:01,679
helpful in in scoping things okay thank

2412
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:05,489
you for that so I think we are pretty

2413
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:08,550
much at time so I have one action item

2414
01:52:05,489 --> 01:52:12,178
to ask of everybody and then I will look

2415
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:14,969
at the ADEs they think I'm thinking that

2416
01:52:12,179 --> 01:52:19,289
it is time for us to move off of the GG

2417
01:52:14,969 --> 01:52:21,480
list and make a new mailing list so

2418
01:52:19,289 --> 01:52:23,400
would people here be willing to

2419
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:25,049
supposing the eighties support creating

2420
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,940
a new mailing this will people here be

2421
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:30,929
willing to sign up to a new mailing list

2422
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:33,928
to pursue this discussion alright we've

2423
01:52:30,929 --> 01:52:37,889
got people willing to sign up anything

2424
01:52:33,929 --> 01:52:39,690
else I will be asking about the blue

2425
01:52:37,889 --> 01:52:40,500
sheets again I know there's one blue

2426
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:42,058
sheet out there

2427
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,730
