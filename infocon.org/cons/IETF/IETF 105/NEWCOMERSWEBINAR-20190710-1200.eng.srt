just a short webinar to get you prepared

8
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,890

O'Donoghue I'm a long time participant

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,390
in the IETF chair of a couple working

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,480
groups and have been involved in the

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,239
education type activities for a while

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:08,940
and co-presenter today rich did you want

15
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:13,520

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,410

yeah my name is rich Saul's I'll be

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:25,080
presenting the middle section today and

19
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:30,810
been doing this tutorial as a webinar

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,940
online for a couple of years now good to

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:39,229
be here

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:42,149
excellent alright so welcome to the IETF

23
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,989
I'm assuming this is the first time for

24
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:48,750
most of you that aren't you are on here

25
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:50,580
the first thing about the IETF is we

26
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,940
have something called that the IETF note

27
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,550
well and you will have possibly read it

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:01,590
or acknowledged it when you register for

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:05,789
the meeting and this is our basically

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,759
set of rules and procedures that we need

31
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:15,800
to follow all of the policies that are

32
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:17,940
in effect it covers things such as our

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,000
anti-harassment policy our code of

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,500
conduct also IPR rules patents and

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,450
participation and those kinds of things

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,510
so this is the set of the

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,819
of at the beginning of every working

38
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,730
grip session you will you will be

39
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,190
presented with this and reminded of this

40
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:41,238
it is the the governing set of rules for

41
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,239
our organization

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,269
the next thing I'd like to highlight

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,359
specifically for newcomers are a set of

44
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:52,940
activities that we have at the upcoming

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:57,739
IETF specifically to get you up to speed

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:02,030
there will be a newcomers tutorial on

47
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:05,160
Sunday afternoon this it's actually a

48
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,450
it's the same set of slides sometimes

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,560
the questions are a little bit different

50
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,170
but it's the same information that

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,220
you'll be getting today slightly

52
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,929
different set of presenters if you have

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,790
additional questions if it would be

54
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,230
might be useful to go again otherwise up

55
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:26,700
you can probably skip that one

56
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:28,470
the IETF quick connections is a short

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,380
it's a one-hour session it's sort of

58
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,139
short one-on-one conversations we do ask

59
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,079
that you sign up for that in advance but

60
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,209
it is an opportunity to have you know

61
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,269
sort of like three to five-minute

62
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:44,069
conversations basically with a number of

63
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,389
different experienced ihe efforts you

64
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,810
can ask them any questions that you have

65
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,100
it seems like a little bit of an odd

66
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,400
type of an activity but it seems to work

67
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,130
really well we do have a mentoring

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,269
program called IETF guides if you would

69
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,410
like you know some people come and

70
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,150
they're already well familiar with the

71
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,819
IETF and they have colleagues others

72
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,000
would like to have a mentor to help get

73
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,298
them started and there's information on

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,250
the guides program there is a newcomers

75
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,478
dinner on Monday night that's strictly

76
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,519
informal it's organized by the

77
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,280
Secretariat that runs the meeting

78
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,560
there's a small you know the small cost

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,270
to cover your food but it's very

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,760
informal for newcomers to get to know

81
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,380
each other and then finally we do have a

82
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,090
feedback session on Thursday and we are

83
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,789
really interested in your feedback on

84
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,109
how it can make this our new comer set

85
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,110
of activities more effective

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:47,008
so moving on to the this presentation

87
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,570
itself this the scope of this

88
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:52,320
presentation is not the entire history

89
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,969
of the IETF it is specifically about the

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,909
basic set of information that you need

91
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,560
to help you start your participation in

92
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,120
the IETF you know whether it's

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,789
immediately useful to you as you get

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,259
started and strategies that will

95
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,259
hopefully make the most of your meeting

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,969
there is a set it's a little bit dated

97
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,508
at this point but this YouTube channel

98
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,300
has this playlist scott Brandner a long

99
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:21,289
time participant in the IETF and leader

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,210
of the community did a whole series of

101
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:27,270
tutorials on history and the various

102
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,729
process pieces of the IETF a few of them

103
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:35,070
need to be updated but it is a very

104
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:38,250
comprehensive set of information all

105
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:44,159
right so the next step is I ATF and

106
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,320
related organizations so the mission of

107
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:48,360
the IETF is is basically to make the

108
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,280
internet better by producing good

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,690
standards you know high quality relevant

110
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,429
technical documents that have an impact

111
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,860
on the way people design manage and use

112
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,300
the Internet this mission has been

113
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:08,099
around for quite a while so what exactly

114
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:10,380
is the IETF it is in an international

115
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,060
standards development organization you

116
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,919
may be familiar with other standards

117
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,139
development organizations like I Triple

118
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:22,530
E or ITU ANSI Etsy there's a number of

119
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,009
standards organizations out there the

120
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,630
IHF is self selected individual

121
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,900
participants in a sense that there's no

122
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,729
formal membership so your your

123
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,820
participation is not based on the

124
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,258
company that you work for or you know

125
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,419
the number of meetings that you've

126
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:44,880
attended we don't do any formal voting

127
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,080
we do home to determine consensus and

128
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,599
there'll be another slide a little bit

129
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,659
later about consensus and humming and

130
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,230
all of that there's also no formal

131
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:58,599
government role so it's

132
00:06:53,230 --> 00:07:02,020
it's not like the ITU in that sense it's

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,550
driven by market-based adoption so we

134
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,250
don't mandate the use of any of the

135
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,440
standards we developed this publication

136
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,810
we develop the specifications and we

137
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,540
publish them and then it's up to the

138
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:18,100
market to actually take them and develop

139
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:22,120
them and deploy them let's focus on

140
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,250
internet technologies sort of goes

141
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,180
without saying I guess and it is

142
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:32,470
bottom-up and and quite unique in the

143
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,150
world of standards at this point the

144
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,700
IETF is currently divided into a number

145
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,760
of areas that group the work into areas

146
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:44,800
that are similar we currently have seven

147
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:50,110
areas and we have applications in real

148
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,550
time so you know the SIP and the voice

149
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,850
conferencing and those kinds of things

150
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,820
fall into that category transports of

151
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,610
TCP UDP quick those kinds of things fall

152
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,530
into the transport area routing

153
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,830
obviously the the core of the Internet

154
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:10,510
the routing protocols the internet area

155
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:13,780
has a lot of your you know you know the

156
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:18,099
historical layer layering model ipv4

157
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,690
ipv6 it also has the technologies that

158
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:24,820
are a little bit lower than that and

159
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:27,270
connect into that ops and management are

160
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,440
operationally related working groups and

161
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,710
network management types of working

162
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,390
groups are and their security there's a

163
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,010
large number of working groups that's

164
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:47,340
associated with security

165
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:52,000
so TLS Acme for certificate based things

166
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,750
a whole bunch related to authentication

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,610
ooofff cozy a number of ones that are

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,970
related to web based authentication and

169
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,830
non web based authentication and finally

170
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,160
the general area which basically has all

171
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,740
of the other things

172
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,370
so the general area tends to not have a

173
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,600
lot of working groups in it there is one

174
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,070
I don't know if it's actually meeting

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,630
this time or not I didn't think to look

176
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,150
at it right now is the I asked the

177
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,710
working group which is looking at

178
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,430
reorganizing the administrative

179
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,900
structure of the IETF so the working

180
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,699
groups around the administrative

181
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:32,689
structure and and those kinds of things

182
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:36,230
fall into the general area so I alluded

183
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:42,980
to this earlier about the IETF and

184
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:44,600
consensus we the IETF motto I guess has

185
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,950
been over the years that we reject Kings

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,330
presidents and voting and that we

187
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,490
believe in rough consensus and running

188
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:54,140
code you know everything has you know

189
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,570
there's the ideal and then there's sort

190
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:02,750
of the reality so rough consensus is

191
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:04,580
basically that you move something

192
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,530
forward or you've achieved rough

193
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,360
consensus when all of the issues have

194
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,550
been addressed but they may not

195
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,030
necessarily have been accommodated so

196
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,770
you a working group can have rough

197
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,990
consensus to move ahead even though

198
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,590
somebody has raised an outstanding issue

199
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,200
that has not actually been accommodated

200
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:26,060
it so everybody has you know dissenting

201
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,740
opinions are heard but they don't

202
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:35,359
necessarily stop the work we use humming

203
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,130
as a way to measure consensus and I was

204
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,920
wondered about this myself you know what

205
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,080
what is the point of humming and you

206
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,120
know even some of the articles in the

207
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,430
popular press sometimes that talk about

208
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,820
the IETF mentioned humming is weird

209
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:54,500
behavior that the IETF does but it

210
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:58,000
actually is a way to measure you know

211
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,560
not only you know whether people feel

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,390
one way or the other based on an issue

213
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,329
but also how passionately they feel

214
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,860
about it so if you have you know you

215
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,080
know you ask for the consensus of the

216
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,380
room and you get this sort of an you

217
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,560
know

218
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,970
meek not very passionate home you know

219
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,260
that people are in favor of it but

220
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,820
they're not really that passionate about

221
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,290
it whereas if it said you know it's a

222
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,259
real

223
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,380
controversial issue and you know we've

224
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:25,149
seen this some times where you'll have

225
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,560
you know you know people humming as loud

226
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,740
as they can you know this is something

227
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,388
that you know there if they had several

228
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,139
votes they would be voting multiple

229
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,380
times

230
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:37,540
so this is where humming comes in the

231
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,519
chair of the session you know either the

232
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,060
working group chair or or whatever the

233
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,250
session is are responsible for building

234
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,569
the consensus and judging it based on

235
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,310
that having said all of that the bottom

236
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,870
line is anything that's actually done in

237
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,930
a physical meeting we take back to

238
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,569
mailing list and all of the final

239
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,469
consensus measurements are done in the

240
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:05,829
context of the mailing list and in true

241
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:09,550
IETF form there's actually even a RFC on

242
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:11,529
consensus and humming in the IETF so

243
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:16,508
that's enough on that I speak briefly a

244
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:18,040
little bit about IETF culture the you

245
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,959
know every organization that I've ever

246
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,610
been a part of every standards group or

247
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,439
every professional association every

248
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,660
everything has its unique culture and

249
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,620
the IETF is in that sense is no

250
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,990
different

251
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,139
it's a lot of very passionate smart

252
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,940
vocal people it is an informal

253
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:36,970
organization so in formal dress code

254
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,470
people love their t-shirts and they're

255
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,810
very proud of you know their t-shirts

256
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:46,600
that date back to you know IETF s many

257
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:48,699
years ago in the ie what we really want

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:54,790
to say is that technical excellence is

259
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:56,740
highly valued so and that a number it's

260
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,589
it's an organization that you know as as

261
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:03,189
time moves on you you develop close

262
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:06,459
working relationships with people so it

263
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:09,310
is is it's meant it's meant to be very

264
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:12,670
technically competent fun and passionate

265
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:17,680
but at all times respectful of the

266
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:21,939
individuals then talk a little bit about

267
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:26,310
the organization of the IETF I haven't

268
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:26,310
been following this the chat so I hope

269
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,020
yeah I'll answer questions Karen later

270
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,790
excellent thank you I just realized that

271
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:43,360
I wasn't doing that but I thought you

272
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:46,569
were anyway so there are as also as in

273
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,400
most organizations has a lot of acronyms

274
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,839
and the IETF in this sense is no

275
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,569
different

276
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,279
what I've done here is sort of

277
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,060
color-coded what you'll see on the badge

278
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:00,370
later there'll be some dots but so the

279
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,579
iesg is the internet Engineering

280
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:06,250
steering group so every area in the IETF

281
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,460
we talked about the seven or eight areas

282
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,710
earlier every area has some number of

283
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,770
area directors you know most of them

284
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:18,100
have - some of them actually have theory

285
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:21,069
and that group of area directors is is

286
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,490
the steering group of the IETF and

287
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,529
that's the iesg so on the right of your

288
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,990
picture you'll see the blue area with

289
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,710
the iesg and the areas and then the

290
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:35,080
working groups inside the areas a

291
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:40,240
parallel organisation to be to the iesg

292
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,370
and the IETF is the IRS G which is the I

293
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,440
mean sorry the IRT F which is the

294
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:48,130
internet research task force so you have

295
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,990
the IETF and the IRT F so if it's ready

296
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,970
to be developed into a protocol

297
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,860
specification it's the IETF and if it's

298
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,280
still sort of a researchy type topic

299
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,050
then it's the IRT F and the IRT F also

300
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,410
has a steering group and it has a number

301
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,719
of research groups and generally it

302
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,339
meets the same you know some of these

303
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,690
research groups meet in parallel with

304
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:14,620
the IETF we'll talk more about that

305
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:17,350
later separate from that there's the

306
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,980
internet architecture board this is made

307
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:24,730
up of I think it's 12 individuals that

308
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:29,250
are selected by the by a process by the

309
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:32,589
NomCom process and they handle things

310
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:37,570
they handle overarching architectural

311
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:39,100
types of issues and they also handle you

312
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,380
know appointments to

313
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,030
additions managing liaisons that kind of

314
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,500
thing the handle loves aspects of the

315
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:49,209
ICF and new this year we have changed

316
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,170
our administrative structure we now have

317
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,760
something called the VI ETF LLC and this

318
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,520
handles all the administrative affairs

319
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,689
of the ietf so in awarding of contracts

320
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,610
and payment of you know all of the

321
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:08,410
administrative pieces that keep the ietf

322
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:11,050
running and I think I talked

323
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,089
sufficiently through all of this I had

324
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,180
the iesg does the technical management

325
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,070
the IETF the IRT f is looking at longer

326
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,160
term research topics that may eventually

327
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,530
transition to the IETF the IAB is

328
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,540
oversight of the overall internet

329
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,180
architecture and the standards process

330
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,400
the LLC is the administrative body so

331
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,760
those are the the four major areas of

332
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,650
the IETF and at this I'm going to stop

333
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,300
and pass it over to rich and he'll talk

334
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:45,100
to you a little bit about the IETF week

335
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:46,209
and in that she'll okay great yes will

336
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,670
the deck be available

337
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:54,250
I see interest okay Karen you get answer

338
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:57,520
questions now all right what like in the

339
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,410
next two weeks from now Karen I'll have

340
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,949
to wake up periodically to turn the next

341
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,949
slide please

342
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:12,760
okay so from the outside especially if

343
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,450
you just sort of laying there hotel

344
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,210
lobby during the week it looks like

345
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:22,710
organize looks like chaos but it's

346
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:27,190
actually a lot going on and it's all be

347
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:30,610
very very organized and scheduled the

348
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:34,030
schedule of events changes as they say

349
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:38,860
we have a final schedule now but there

350
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:40,620
will be notices and changes up until the

351
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,300
day something is supposed to happen

352
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,510
that won't happen for big things like

353
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,600
the pleasure which I'll mention or a

354
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,220
deep dive but it can often happen that a

355
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,330
working group will be cancelled at the

356
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,790
last minute

357
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,040
the logistics or people just not being

358
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,510
interested or they had two sessions and

359
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,750
they ended up not needing it and so on

360
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:04,210
so the kinds of things that are on the

361
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,000
agenda I think agenda is available

362
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,820
online you probably should have gotten a

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,950
link or seen the link when you register

364
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,649
there'll be a link at the end of the

365
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,140
page there's working group sessions

366
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,060
that's the bulk of what we're all about

367
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,220
I'll talk some more about that birds of

368
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,110
a feather or informal starting things

369
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,910
all of these we'll get into most of

370
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:29,729
these we'll cover it in subsequent

371
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:32,620
slides as I RTF Karen mentioned is

372
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,890
looking at things that don't fit into a

373
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:39,370
neatly a little problem let's say for

374
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:42,970
example Human Rights implications and

375
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,790
privacy requirements and so on he on

376
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,940
perfect network protocols there are some

377
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,980
that are very good fit and focus for

378
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,090
sort of an advanced development team if

379
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,400
you think of it in a commercial

380
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,949
environment such as the crypto forum

381
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,810
research group always comes up you know

382
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,660
they're the ones that you assigned

383
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:06,639
experts for new crypto algorithms and so

384
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:09,390
on I'll call out the A&R you this is an

385
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,300
ACM conference there are invited papers

386
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:16,810
presentations you can need to register

387
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:20,889
I believe it's Monday Tuesday but you

388
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:23,800
can with your it's free with your IETF

389
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,630
attendance the hackathons and cold

390
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,379
sprints that's the weekend before

391
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,660
Saturday Sunday a hackathon well again

392
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,540
I'll talk about that more social events

393
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,610
were having this time and the rest of

394
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,180
these things we will discuss on

395
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:46,300
subsequent slides so the next one please

396
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:48,900
come on alright so then there's a lot of

397
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:53,760
things that are not on the agenda

398
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:56,170
hallway meetings and this is it's quite

399
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,390
it not only is a common but it's

400
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,060
expected if you have a question or you

401
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,500
want to you you asked a question or had

402
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,710
some discussion and you want to get more

403
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,080
involved in it or things this

404
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,270
got someone who's you know I just partly

405
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,879
I saw you you know you came to the my

406
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,590
class at the previous session whatever

407
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,520
can I talk to you about someone so hi my

408
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,250
name is rich um everyone is approachable

409
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,820
there are aspects of community that can

410
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,279
sometimes be harder to overcome but

411
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,529
there's that so hallway meetings we just

412
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,159
chatting a hall there are breaks between

413
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:36,399
every session every other break has you

414
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,899
know coffee bagels pastries or something

415
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:41,979
like that so people know about and talk

416
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:44,139
there's what's called a bar bar this is

417
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,669
a group of people get together and say

418
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,299
hey let's go down with that pub over

419
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:52,840
there and I saw and talked about

420
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:56,100
deployment of DNS security options then

421
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,289
there's marathon editing sense for often

422
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,059
we're developing the purpose that's kind

423
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:03,820
of mentioned of the IETF is develop

424
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:06,490
high-quality technical documents the

425
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:11,860
other people and use and implement up

426
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:14,409
from and so often you know better than

427
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,850
de Mayo or github pull request for

428
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:17,110
making vacuuming changes you just get

429
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,809
three or four people to sit around the

430
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,029
table and what's called work myth or

431
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,918
even just address fundamental issues

432
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:25,330
they'll often come back to the working

433
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,799
group of its meeting later in the week

434
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,158
and say okay this is what we did here

435
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:34,440
some resolve everything there is an IETF

436
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:39,700
app available for both Android and Apple

437
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,380
it is your friend it will carry all of

438
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,539
the latest schedule changes you can

439
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,750
highlight things that you care about it

440
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:50,470
will have on the it can be added to your

441
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,960
calendar I believe on the Apple and it

442
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,210
can make your own custom schedule the

443
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,940
agenda online and they're on the link is

444
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,279
also your friend there are some

445
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,559
last-minute changes posted when you

446
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,289
register you can see whether the post a

447
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,270
note on the next to usually there's a

448
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,158
map of the hotel and asked edge and an

449
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,870
agenda and then it'll be a posted

450
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,549
there's all this mean working groups

451
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,529
cancel this one decided to meet over

452
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,879
here and so on

453
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,880
next slide please

454
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:27,040
the working group sessions this is the

455
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:31,060
main part of the week it is the reason

456
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:35,350
why the week is scheduled a working

457
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:39,100
group is the basic unit of activity that

458
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:41,919
produces most rfcs there are research

459
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,919
and individual streams but the stuff to

460
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,980
become RFC or what you think of as a

461
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:53,920
standard is generally done in a working

462
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:56,050
group um that work happens on email

463
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,450
lists each working group has an email

464
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,129
list as Karen said there are about a

465
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,620
hundred or I said there are about 130

466
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,760
working groups 80 or so of them are

467
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,379
meeting on this upcoming week and that

468
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,870
means is you know hundreds of mailing

469
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,380
lists working group closes the mailing

470
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,939
list stays open face to face meetings

471
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,880
are solved are done for solving key

472
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,460
issues so the quick working group for

473
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,470
example rather than presenting or

474
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,340
discussing any possible new work they're

475
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:30,460
spending all of their time addressing

476
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,879
open issues you know think of it as a

477
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:37,120
github issue or github Laura Klock the

478
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,490
sessions are streamed online and

479
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,500
recordings very much like this using the

480
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,800
same medical facilities and our friendly

481
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,370
medical staff you'll see as you can see

482
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,470
in this picture there are you know

483
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,729
here's a remote presenter because

484
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,890
everybody in the room they're all

485
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,700
looking at the tops these are looking up

486
00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:00,820
that happens the picture on the right is

487
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,680
a disc on the right is text some of

488
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,290
these presenting some work and the

489
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,750
screen on the Left shows somebody

490
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:12,250
presenting via you know remote meet echo

491
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:14,860
probably so the sessions are streamed

492
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,200
recorded and available afterward the ITF

493
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:22,330
has a YouTube channel that covers each

494
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:25,150
of the ITF meetings the Charter is what

495
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,220
the group is focused on that's the area

496
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:30,310
directors and covering those eight areas

497
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,400
that Karen went through before the area

498
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:40,540
directors approve

499
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:44,890
the truck okay Andrew yes exactly and

500
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:47,480
nexon to the feather

501
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,460
it's from the I don't know English

502
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,920
American phrase birds of a feather flock

503
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:59,390
together it goes back a long time in the

504
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:02,630
computer industry and it's an informal

505
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,610
gathering not as structured as a working

506
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,800
group meeting in that there's while

507
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,540
there's a chair so I'm gonna sort of is

508
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,159
probably an agenda and some discussion

509
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,290
they want to get through on they're not

510
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,870
trying to produce units what they're

511
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:19,190
trying to produce is perhaps a working

512
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:20,899
group they'll discuss the Charter what

513
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,150
the group is intended to work on a rough

514
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,000
timetable Oh it'll take a year to do

515
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,730
this two years to do that and so on

516
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,500
it generally meets only once you'll

517
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,810
sometimes hear the phrase working with

518
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:37,370
performing or non working group for me

519
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,050
it can start as a barback which is not

520
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,820
scheduled then there's a scheduled bath

521
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,340
and then there's a next thing would be a

522
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,129
working group looking at figuring out

523
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,580
how to stand up a working group without

524
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:55,270
having face-to-face bath meetings the

525
00:25:49,580 --> 00:26:00,530
discussion okay next slide please

526
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:03,920
the our ITF sessions the RTF is part of

527
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:06,470
is a function of the IAB the internet

528
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,980
our activities board architecture board

529
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:12,260
um more on research as I mentioned below

530
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,320
the areas things like privacy and human

531
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,750
rights considerations

532
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,820
there's one on good daya how do we get

533
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,700
the entire world linked up onto the

534
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,860
internet things like that there are more

535
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,210
focused short-term research things like

536
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:32,990
photography algorithms how do you do

537
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:34,520
verifiable one - for example if that

538
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,250
means anything to you great if not

539
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,600
there's plenty of other research groups

540
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,250
all of the art they need at the same

541
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,060
time they follow much of the same

542
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,350
structure but being a working group it's

543
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,850
a

544
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:52,689
search groups of RG instead of WG the

545
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,070
RFC listed there is a useful primer on

546
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,620
the other hand if you think of it as

547
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:59,110
just oh these things are discussing and

548
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,449
moon actually result in a standard with

549
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:06,879
bits on the wire that's probably a good

550
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:10,660
enough next a nrw the applied network

551
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,140
research workshop so this is becoming

552
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:16,929
revitalized and rescheduled to be look

553
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:21,030
co-located with the ITF so that's pretty

554
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:23,730
cool for a number of area of reasons I

555
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:29,440
guess too both of which are the

556
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:32,830
cross-fertilization sorry my screen

557
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,990
lessly over cross-fertilization so we

558
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,389
have a lot of academics talking about

559
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:40,720
theoretical issues with head-of-line

560
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:44,980
blocking in HTTP or how I can

561
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,320
fingerprint but hosted on what hosts how

562
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,700
I can fingerprint identify a host based

563
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:57,610
on its DNS traffic or analysis and then

564
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:59,559
it brings academics and research to the

565
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,629
IETF so that people can learn about the

566
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,440
implications and and impacts of some of

567
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,720
what they're doing it also brings

568
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,830
academics into the IOT I think many of

569
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,840
them go to you know I RTF groups but

570
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:19,360
some of them also coming to IETF groups

571
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,370
because you know a motivator you know is

572
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,969
getting in our sea published or or

573
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:27,610
influenced work you might see the name

574
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:30,450
Sharon Goldberg she and her graduate

575
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:35,199
students have been very influential in

576
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:37,110
cryptography DNS security ntp time the

577
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,169
time protocol security and so on

578
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:44,678
separate registration um you can you

579
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:48,309
know anyone you just sign up and that

580
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:54,010
will probably be ongoing you know yearly

581
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:56,158
thing co-located with the July IETF next

582
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,158
page

583
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:05,209
there are ok so these are three kinds of

584
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,190
meetings that also happen not working

585
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,650
group which might be anywhere from 10 to

586
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,090
50 you know maybe 80 people for the

587
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:15,500
quick or something like or the first

588
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:18,530
acne 120 um but these are area wide

589
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:21,950
sessions so the area's transport

590
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:25,370
routings pyridine so on they almost all

591
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,950
of them have a meeting or two where they

592
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,168
will review what their working groups

593
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,630
have done and yeah posted my notes or a

594
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:36,650
list or yes we're not being told

595
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,540
tomorrow that happened or another area

596
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,220
another thing that happens in area wide

597
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,100
sessions they often have to dispatch

598
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,070
where someone will say I have this idea

599
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,309
I think this you know this applies to

600
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:52,820
the routing area where should I go and

601
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:54,500
then a group of people just back up to

602
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,110
the appropriate working group very

603
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,059
useful for newcomers to the IETF to

604
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:03,139
attend those or at least understand that

605
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:04,760
there um and anyone can go it's not just

606
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,100
you'll find just security people at the

607
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,129
security group and you don't find DNS

608
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:14,360
people that they the operations group

609
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:23,570
and so on plenary in word that means all

610
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:25,879
attend okay so these are the the border

611
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,889
has become more or less strictly defined

612
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,850
depending on which meeting it is and how

613
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:34,580
its organized there's usually a

614
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,129
technical presentation so we've had on

615
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:41,139
Dave Clark one of the founding

616
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,760
architects of the protocols talk about

617
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,640
tilting in field appropriately when

618
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,500
you're defining a protocol I remember

619
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,169
somebody else talking about Hannes I

620
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,590
think talking about trusted computing

621
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:56,809
zones inside you know on trips or Intel

622
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,760
trips um then there is the

623
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:04,160
administrative part and this is where

624
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,710
that bit soup Karen showed before they

625
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,400
get up and they swap around I talk about

626
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,840
well these are the things these are

627
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,260
feels we've had this is what our

628
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,510
attendance is like the society countries

629
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,980
are coming to this one this is what our

630
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,280
budget looks like for the next six

631
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,990
months and so on there's often

632
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,350
announcements as to future where future

633
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:29,170
IETF meetings will be located as you can

634
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,030
imagine for a meeting that has anywhere

635
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,890
between eight and fifteen hundred people

636
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,530
you can't just sort of show up at a

637
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,310
hotel without and that you know

638
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,230
unannounced

639
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:43,050
so there's a lot of planning and

640
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,050
announcements for that next please

641
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,350
the hackathons and codes friends so this

642
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,180
one when I give the when we give the

643
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,649
tutorial on Sunday unfortunately have to

644
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,990
say you just missed it it was really

645
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,400
great but since this is before the

646
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:02,740
meeting on Saturday and Sunday

647
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,370
there's hackathons where people have

648
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:10,380
come together and do independent

649
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:15,639
interoperable implementation testing so

650
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:17,290
testing new types of DNS records TLS 1.3

651
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,290
went through a number of these things

652
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:23,830
where you know major importers open SSL

653
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:25,720
Facebook Mozilla Chrome all got together

654
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,270
and you know tried to make their clients

655
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,050
talk to the servers and so on on so that

656
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:34,120
happens Sunday and Saturday you can just

657
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,730
you register for it you get a free

658
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,500
t-shirt you just lunch is provided you

659
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,120
just sort of you can just sort of show

660
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,180
up and there is a list on the wiki on

661
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,729
the meeting wiki about what hackathon

662
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,460
projects people are working on it's

663
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,380
still not too late to define you know

664
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:56,170
add a new but you probably not get a lot

665
00:32:50,380 --> 00:33:00,430
of attendance code sprint you just oops

666
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:03,970
jump there okay thank code sprints are

667
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:06,640
for people developing the IETF tooling

668
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:09,190
on that includes the the publishing

669
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,170
stuff that change how our C's are

670
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:15,700
generated how drafts are tracked and so

671
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:17,140
on the website data tracker dot IETF

672
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,730
thought org which is a newcomer you

673
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,520
probably will not care about too much

674
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,660
but by the time you tell me your next

675
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,580
meeting

676
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,200
start to participate me mailing list you

677
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:31,470
will become intimately familiar with

678
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,470
parts of the data tracker next one is

679
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:38,260
networking in social events so the one

680
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,900
on the left there is at the Singapore

681
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,050
national aquarium as I recall so it's a

682
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,090
giant fish tank you step a picture would

683
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,010
look just this giant octopus pressed up

684
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:52,629
against the glass but probably a little

685
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:54,100
too intimidating the event there is

686
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,160
probably not too late to buy social

687
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,649
tickets the quality of them you know it

688
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,870
varies but as a way to just you know get

689
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:04,050
a free dinner and drinks and meet some

690
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:08,918
people in a social environment it's

691
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:13,360
going to the one on the right is the

692
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:15,549
IETF sisters this is for women and those

693
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,070
presenters women in the IETF as a

694
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,290
support social and support group I'll

695
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,780
talk some more about that

696
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:29,889
so Karen will and the resources oops put

697
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:32,679
slides there's still more so we have

698
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:36,370
side meetings one of the things we're

699
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,320
experimenting with is unstructured

700
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,190
meeting time so there's a time slot

701
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,200
every morning

702
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,418
where nobody is where there aren't any

703
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,178
were upset so that people can get

704
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,668
together and have informal side

705
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,040
discussions it's an ongoing experiment

706
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:53,730
trying to find out the right place in

707
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,210
which to do it

708
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:59,710
so that's the link there tutorials or

709
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,660
Sunday afternoon there's this one

710
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,610
there's one on how to write a security

711
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,100
considerations document in the past

712
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,780
we've had how do you know the structure

713
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:12,339
and format of rfcs and so on

714
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,940
tutorials so those tutorials a deep dive

715
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:20,320
is usually someone you know it is

716
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:23,590
someone deeply entrenched in technology

717
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,040
for their job and so last meeting we had

718
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:30,580
a deep dive on the architecture of

719
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,560
modern routers it's not just a simple

720
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,970
look at a packet send it out kind of

721
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,580
thing hot our

722
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:41,180
see is a hot topics people get 10

723
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:43,400
minutes to talk about something and then

724
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:48,020
the idea is to see if there's any

725
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,420
interest acne got which is the let's

726
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,480
encrypt certificate protocol if you will

727
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,490
and on the chair we got do people would

728
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,160
come and present at acne and one of them

729
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:01,069
is moving forward as a standards

730
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,060
document also not on this list is Pecha

731
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:08,359
Kucha which is a lightweight satirical

732
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:11,440
thing if you spin on the ietf attendees

733
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:16,040
list a little notices from Erin Fox

734
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:21,890
next please so talk about general

735
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:24,770
behavior meeting a tacit read the

736
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:28,310
documents before coming to the session

737
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:31,790
you don't want to be on the sessions are

738
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:34,070
not tutorials of the documents and in

739
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:37,790
particular if documents has in gone

740
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:39,890
through several drafts a draft is a

741
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:43,550
checkpoint where the version document is

742
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:45,069
sort of uploaded to the data tracker and

743
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,560
then people can fetch it and read it

744
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:51,410
what will be discussed or presented in

745
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,640
the room is the changes since the last

746
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:57,080
time so in order to do that in order to

747
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,690
appreciate that you should know what

748
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,670
happened what was in the last time right

749
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,310
and then they'll be you can come to the

750
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:07,160
mic and questions or say well if you

751
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:10,520
consider this and so on behave

752
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:13,670
respectfully in tolerantly ATF does not

753
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,960
tolerate harassment you know there's a

754
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:20,030
slide on that later on um you know where

755
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,720
computer people look pretty acceptable

756
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,190
of people on you know I was gonna say

757
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,730
the fringe but who knows what the fringe

758
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,430
is if you look at idea it's it's a good

759
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,130
mirror of society we want to get better

760
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:36,560
talk to people listen then we we

761
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,690
encourage it all you know technical

762
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,390
opinions a lot of these people know each

763
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:43,250
other um so don't be put off maybe by

764
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,180
how they address have a good time

765
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,210
I'm sorry how they address each other

766
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,618
and don't feel you have to

767
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:54,180
slide in there and talk all of the lingo

768
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:57,510
at the time and remember this sleep

769
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:01,288
meeting start you know people will often

770
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:03,390
get together for breakfast at 8:30 start

771
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:05,910
talking technical stuff all the way

772
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,890
through until the last meeting I verse

773
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:11,549
seven then they'll go out to dinner and

774
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:14,460
or a bar afterwards to keep talking it's

775
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:18,900
hard a focused and technical and

776
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:24,029
organized and bright and smart for you

777
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:26,309
know 12 16 hours but it goes on all the

778
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:29,539
time don't feel you have to attend every

779
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:35,099
meeting or every social event social

780
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:37,529
next page bringing new work to the ITF

781
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,420
so if you have an idea that you don't

782
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:42,900
see covered in the agenda or you haven't

783
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,200
seen a working first on and you haven't

784
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,750
seen a working group devoted to it

785
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,529
here's how to bring a new work find some

786
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:54,960
collaborators so this could be you know

787
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:56,460
a side meeting talking to people saying

788
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,670
are you interested in this thing that I

789
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:03,270
want to work on write some kind of

790
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,039
document an initial draft maybe have a

791
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:07,559
barb off where you get to get the people

792
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:13,349
hey I really want to talk about is DNS

793
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:18,029
to store PGP keys I don't know talk to

794
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:20,279
the area directors this is you know your

795
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:22,020
chance to find attractive down there

796
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:24,089
obviously very busy there has to be an

797
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,609
area director every working group

798
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:30,089
meeting so their schedules are pretty

799
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:32,009
booked but someone hanging I'm

800
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:34,640
interested in discussing this

801
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:37,140
they might say follow up with me offline

802
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,020
but at least you'll have it connect then

803
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,640
you in a face the next step area

804
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,009
directors approve it is you propose a

805
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,009
sorry you propose up off the area

806
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:49,799
directors review it make suggestions if

807
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:52,980
it's once it's been accepted you hold

808
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:56,038
them off and determine a consent will

809
00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:01,600
determine the next step we've had I know

810
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:04,780
of a couple of boss where it was

811
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,640
no working group was formed because we

812
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,920
couldn't find a good use of the

813
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,910
technology or we didn't feel that if the

814
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:16,650
I did anything here um it would be used

815
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,549
by industry and then they've been groups

816
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,680
where it's like oh why are we even

817
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,380
having a bot just let's get the group

818
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,819
and start this and you know rubber stamp

819
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,740
this protocol right you know just put

820
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:30,810
our imprimatur on this protocol right

821
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:36,339
away so these they span the gamut and a

822
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:39,759
buff is they bring energy and in ten new

823
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:42,030
interest in potential areas to the to

824
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,350
work we had one bought that was

825
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,300
sponsored by the ITF chair at the time

826
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:50,350
and that didn't go anywhere so there's

827
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:54,180
no no no shame or embarrassment about

828
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,180
that next please

829
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:02,710
so during the working groups patios near

830
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,930
talks there will be a mic in everyone

831
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,360
the picture before showed you know a

832
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:12,730
couple of screens and mic depending on

833
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:16,120
the size of the room and the size of the

834
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:18,610
room is by how many people have attended

835
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,650
previous meetings so we collect all of

836
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,020
the information collect their numbers

837
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,780
and is part of schedule say oh that's

838
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,040
last two times you have fifty people why

839
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,620
are you asking for a hundred people now

840
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,390
you know but the size of the room and

841
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,770
how many mics there are the way

842
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,049
discussion works is there's people

843
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:38,440
presenting and then people line up at

844
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,910
the mics to say something it might be

845
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,740
asking a question they might be saying

846
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,870
have you you know a pointed question

847
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,419
would be you know rambling off-topic

848
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:49,990
hopefully not too much of that you speak

849
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,910
directly into the mic it's hard often

850
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,979
you'll hear the crowd going swallow the

851
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,740
mics Oh Mikey you have to be really

852
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:59,530
really close depending on you know what

853
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,660
facilities the hotel has to bring say

854
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:05,500
your name every time because people are

855
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:07,660
listening to this remotely there's also

856
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,170
not only the audio and video screen but

857
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:15,009
there is an instant messaging jabber

858
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:19,180
room that will that also goes out

859
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:21,010
is used by all the folks on the blue

860
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,799
sheets provide a record and determine

861
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:26,260
future planning any kind of technical

862
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,500
commenting questions are welcome long

863
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:32,170
detailed discussions you say a few

864
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,250
points then you can move right around

865
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:38,440
back

866
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:41,470
so line if you have more to say but yes

867
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,960

868
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,819
speaker I might but you can you know

869
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,500
make the points and that you said this

870
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,900
discussion will continue as people go

871
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,900

872
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:58,180
okay so I will turn it back over to

873
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,010
Karen to talk about some of the

874
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:07,140
resources and things that are available

875
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:13,120
I will be co-presenting this tutorial

876
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:14,770
Sunday feel free to come up during that

877

or at the end of it with any other you

878
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:25,390
know if you have other questions at all

879
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:28,780
an answer here okay so the third part of

880
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,710
the mmm excuse me third part of the

881
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,800
tutorial talks a little bit about

882
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,970
resources and information so the first

883
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,910
thing we're going to talk about is the

884
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:38,470
people the first set of people that you

885
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,720
really want to know are the IETF

886
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,750
Secretariat this is the team of

887
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,230
individuals who basically run the

888
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,820
meeting so they do all of the planning

889
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,500
they run the registration systems in

890
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:55,030
advance they man the registration desk

891
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,570
they handle all of the issues associated

892
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,970
with the room you'll easily be able to

893
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:06,220
find them throughout the week very

894
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:08,709
helpful very important to know the next

895
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:11,020
set are two teams of people that you

896
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,660
will they generally have tables set up

897
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:16,690
in the registration area the first thing

898
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,210
the RFC editor staff so the RFC editor

899
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,790
is the team of people that do all of the

900
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,270
actual publication wants the document is

901
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,400
finished

902
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,380
so if you have any questions if you have

903
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,760
a document that you're already working

904
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,140
on that's in the process of being

905
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,170
published

906
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:35,710
and you know you can get help with it

907
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:37,780
on-site with the RSC staff Diana does

908
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,550
all of the assigned internet assigned

909
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,060
names and numbers and so if you are

910
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,770
looking for an I an assignment or you

911
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,900
have a question about how to write an

912
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,940
ionic considerations for a document or

913
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,070
you know you just want to understand how

914
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,810
I Anna works a little bit better

915
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:55,510
you'll find office hours for both of

916
00:44:52,810 --> 00:45:01,000
those sets of staff in the registration

917
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:03,640
area of the ietf the ietf has an

918
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,380
executive director I believe technically

919
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,270
it's currently the interim executive

920
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,910
director while they're in the process of

921
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:12,670
redoing all the administrative stuff and

922
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:16,629
this is Portia and she'll be around all

923
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:19,990
week being able to find her and then

924
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:22,180
finally we have an Ombuds team which

925
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,830
alluded to this earlier we do have an

926
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:28,270
anti-harassment policy or we have a

927
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:32,020
harassment policy and we have an Ombuds

928
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:34,180
team that if you have any issues or you

929
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,990
want to talk to somebody about behavior

930
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:43,359
that you have observed or behavior that

931
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:46,180
you have received then you can talk to

932
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,070
any of these individuals and it's a

933
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,839
strictly confidential and they've had

934
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:58,300
all the appropriate training - and to

935
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:59,770
help you go forward with that as in any

936
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,090
meeting that you've probably ever been

937
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:04,300
to you will receive a badge

938
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,400
the IHF is very proud of their dots and

939
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,780
ribbons everything is color-coded to

940
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:14,620
help you determine you know who the

941
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:18,220
various folks are there are dots on the

942
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:20,680
badges and the dots indicate roles like

943
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,089
working group chairs or the NomCom we

944
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,810
didn't really talk much about the NomCom

945
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:27,310
in this presentation because it's not

946
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,710
really relevant to attending your first

947
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:31,720
meeting but the nominations committee or

948
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,570
the NomCom is what selects all of the

949
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:38,560
leadership of the ietf and they will be

950
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:40,790
wearing orange iesg your area directors

951
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,330
will be have yellow dots

952
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:46,370
IAB has red dots IRS G which is a

953
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,759
steering group for the IRT F they have

954
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:53,210
pink dots the RFC series editor has a

955
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,370
teal dot and the ietf LLC have currently

956
00:46:53,210 --> 00:47:00,080
has black dots there are also some

957
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:01,490
ribbons some of the ribbons are are you

958
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,470
know like official kinds of ribbons and

959
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,390
others are ribbons that are self

960
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:08,080
selected so they generally have a big

961
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,370
pile of ribbons that you can self-select

962
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,810
the other thing the ayat F generally has

963
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:19,370
is if it's a big board of buttons and

964
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:21,860
basically it started out as a way for

965
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,210
people to identify denta phi if they

966
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,770
spoke another language in that way

967
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,440
somebody who was struggling a bit who

968
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:30,230
spoke that language could approach that

969
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,630
person and it has it has really exploded

970
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,280
because it's fascinating how many

971
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:38,630
different languages members of the IETF

972
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:42,680
speak so if you you know look for them

973
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:44,990
for the big big banner with all the

974
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,120
different buttons and you can identify

975
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,529
which languages you speak if you're

976
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,040
willing to reach out to others that

977
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,040
speak that language

978
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,370
some specific resources for newcomers

979
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:01,160
the first is the Tao of the IETF it has

980
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:03,799
been updated recently so we have a 2019

981
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:08,420
Edition it's available on the website at

982
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:11,330
this link and it basically is the

983
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:14,480
novices guide to the IETF gives you a

984
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:19,160
lot of interesting information folklore

985
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,260
that kind of thing there is and if

986
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,819
you've registered I know that you've

987
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,410
received links to this an email but

988
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,710
there is a newcomers information page

989
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:30,850
for ITF 105 and that gives you links to

990
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:33,710
all of the various newcomers activities

991
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:37,779
there are you know this tutorial and

992
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:40,340
previous tutorials on both technical

993
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,240
process-oriented and newcomer related

994
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,500
there's a whole bunch of old tutorials

995
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:49,810
previously that we're done that are

996
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,810
available at the link on for tutorials

997
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:54,780
some more meeting resources there is a

998
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:57,610
meeting wiki

999
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,620
the there's a number of things that are

1000
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,780
available on the meeting wiki and folks

1001
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:04,569
can contribute to it as they need to one

1002
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,670
of the most important things you know we

1003
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,530
alluded earlier to these the side

1004
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,380
meetings and this sort of open free time

1005
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:13,920
this is where the IETF is experimenting

1006
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,360
with its agenda to allow for more

1007
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,420
support for side meetings and those

1008
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:24,340
kinds of things all of that scheduling

1009
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:30,400
is done on ITF one of on the meeting

1010
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:35,580
wiki just quick jump in town also right

1011
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,580
chairs to and from court also schedule

1012
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,680
you can be you know six people crammed

1013
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,930
in a cab headed to the airport for the

1014
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,230
same phone was a good way to socialize

1015
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:50,109
with your colleagues yeah there's

1016
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:52,680
several sections in the wiki that will

1017
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:57,250
help you with that those kinds of things

1018
00:49:52,680 --> 00:50:00,640
there is a first time attendees mailing

1019
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:02,580
list and I just realized the thing we

1020
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,690
don't have on here there is also an

1021
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,410
attendees mailing list for the whole

1022
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:09,910
meeting and you can opt in or opt out of

1023
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,470
that mailing list at the point at which

1024
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,600
you register and then you can always go

1025
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,850
and add yourself back in later but the

1026
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,910
point of that mailing list is you know

1027
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:21,390
meeting specific information and this

1028
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:25,660
can you know range from anywhere from

1029
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:28,330
discussions about you know where the

1030
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,580
best local coffee shop is to you know

1031
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,130
how to control the alarm clock in your

1032
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:35,049
bedroom it's the range of conversations

1033
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:38,080
that can show up on the attendees list

1034
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:40,590
is to two relevant technical topics as

1035
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,790
well but it's a wide-ranging list

1036
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:46,900
associated with issues associated with

1037
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:49,480
the meaning ITF sisters we talked about

1038
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:52,330
a little earlier IHF sister the that's a

1039
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,010
blog post about the sisters and then

1040
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,470
from there you can get information on

1041
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:00,400
how to join the mailing list it is a

1042
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:03,100
very informal group of women they get

1043
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,670
together to sort of support each other

1044
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,900
and you know talk about yeah sister

1045
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,390
related things

1046
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:14,650
we do have a couple of sister activities

1047
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:17,109
that are at the ietf there's a Monday

1048
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,820
networking breakfast which is very

1049
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,230
informal like you know coffee and

1050
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,690
pastries and sort of getting to know

1051
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:26,260
each other and then later in the week we

1052
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:30,250
have a our traditional event which is

1053
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:32,410
our Thursday lunch and both of those are

1054
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:36,190
open to to folks that want to attend

1055
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:37,629
that there are a number of other mailing

1056
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:40,720
lists this is that potentially

1057
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,250
associated with the meeting and some of

1058
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,850
those are available there at you know

1059
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,950
things like travel companions sometimes

1060
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:50,710
you know it depends some meetings have

1061
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,700
like you know like a running list or you

1062
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,410
know a group of people that are

1063
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,850
interested in doing something specific

1064
00:51:53,410 --> 00:52:00,620
and coordinating that and they'll spin

1065
00:51:54,850 --> 00:52:02,009
up a separate mailing list for that next

1066
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:05,350
[Applause]

1067
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:07,570
having said all of that probably the

1068
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:09,160
single most important link that you all

1069
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:12,430
you need to know about is the data

1070
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:16,060
tracker all of the documents in the IETF

1071
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:19,299
all of the meeting materials the agenda

1072
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,700
for the meeting the Charter all of the

1073
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:27,550
assets associated with the IETF are

1074
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:31,720
available via the data tracker and I put

1075
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:33,460
a link in earlier about oh you know

1076
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,399
where this where the slides would be

1077
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:38,230
later and I pointed to the materials

1078
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,740
page well the materials page is part of

1079
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:44,320
the data tracker so that's the one tool

1080
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,790
I mean you can look at individual

1081
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,230
working groups and then you can look at

1082
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,350
past meetings for those working groups

1083
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:51,460
the agenda for the current meaning

1084
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:54,029
pretty much everything that you need

1085
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,380
would be there there's also the tools

1086
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:58,090
page which is sort of the experimental

1087
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,680
piece of data tracker so a lot of times

1088
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,570
things are developed on tools and then

1089
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,430
eventually transition somehow into the

1090
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,890
data tracker but it's a different

1091
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,299
slightly different packaging of some of

1092
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:10,540
the same information and then some

1093
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:15,100
additional tools are are available there

1094
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:17,119
as well both of those are very handy to

1095
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,940
have

1096
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,470
remote participation I'm you know we

1097
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,290
didn't check to see how many of you all

1098
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:28,669
would be physically on site versus

1099
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:30,710
remote obviously attendance at IETF

1100
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,390
meetings is not required you can you

1101
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,220
know we have people that have

1102
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,690
participated actively in working groups

1103
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,808
for years that have never been to a

1104
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:41,359
face-to-face meeting our remote

1105
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:43,130
participation is provided by mideco

1106
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:50,779
this is the tool that we're currently

1107
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:54,109
using for this webinar and it is the the

1108
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:56,240
Meccan you know the through Medeco you

1109
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:58,369
can schedule presentations you can

1110
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,930
present in a working group provided that

1111
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:02,270
you you know do all the advanced stuff

1112
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:04,009
that you need to do you can get in a

1113
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:07,069
virtual queue and ask your questions

1114
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:08,780
there's a number of and then afterwards

1115
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:11,540
all of the recordings from all of the

1116
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,579
meetings are put up on YouTube there is

1117
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:17,150
currently no cost to participate

1118
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:21,349
remotely you are asked to register and

1119
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:27,109
there's instructions for that that's

1120
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:31,069
true and they do an amazing job so say

1121
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:33,920
thank you if you see them the network at

1122
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:37,009
the IETF the IETF does run its own event

1123
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,630
network and sometimes we run part of the

1124
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:42,440
hotel network as well depending on the

1125
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:45,020
circumstances it's generally up and

1126
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,329
running by Friday afternoon early

1127
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,009
Saturday and it's taken down around noon

1128
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:53,450
on Friday of the meeting depending on

1129
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:56,210
when the last activities run we do run a

1130
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:58,460
number of Wireless SS IDs for different

1131
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,510
purposes we're currently discussing you

1132
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,990
know how we should actually be doing

1133
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:05,510
this going forward there is an IETF

1134
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:07,040
legacy network and and basically it's a

1135
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,109
fully open network it's our way to

1136
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,619
transition from open networks to

1137
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:15,078
encrypted networks we do have a quiet

1138
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:16,369
workspace the space formerly known as

1139
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,619
the turmoil room it doesn't actually

1140
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:22,040
have any terminals it does have power

1141
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:23,420
and a wired Ethernet connectivity it

1142
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,140
used to also have the printer in the

1143
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,490
help desk last the last IETF we move the

1144
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,290
printer and the help desk into the

1145
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:35,129
registration area for more visibility

1146
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:36,870
there is a ticketing system that if you

1147
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,980
have any problems with any part of the

1148
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:42,720
meeting actually not just the network

1149
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:44,640
you can use the ticketing system so if
