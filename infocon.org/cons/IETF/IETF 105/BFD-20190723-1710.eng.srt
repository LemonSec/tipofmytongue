00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,539
[Music]

4
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:18,050
okay good afternoon everyone welcome to

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:21,580
the FP and eight f-105 in Montreal it's

6
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:25,670
gender today is mostly dedicated towards

7
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,980
discussion about futures of EFT so try

8
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,150
to get to that use the presentation

9
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,470
fairly quickly so the agenda today

10
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,430
[Music]

11
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,200
relatively short in the grand scheme of

12
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:41,630
things I will be having presentation on

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:44,810
service redundancy sandy Gregg will give

14
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:49,009
a update from his last version of

15
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,020
presentation and VFD basically extended

16
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,600
features and we're good using that as a

17
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,449
seat to a discussion specifically for

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,059
the FTP to success if we have a little

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,980
bit of time at the end we also go to

20
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,910
backup slides for the important group

21
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,740
last haul stuff from giftie vehicle and

22
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,538
key things out of that one is the ft per

23
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,459
vehicle and has actually completed

24
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,609
working group last call and as part of

25
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,710
is G other review greg has been working

26
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,250
as they try to resolve a lot of last

27
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,930
minute

28
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,950
ments that we've gotten especially from

29
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,050
people from mvo 3 he'll be sending out a

30
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,530
summary of the outstanding issues to the

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,300
mailing list and some requests for

32
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,390
further review BFD once we've resolved

33
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,600
their comments andrey likely to take

34
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:41,570
that to a secondary working group last

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:44,420
call based on element the unsolicited

36
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,130
VFD document is effectively stable and

37
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,049
ready for work or group secret last call

38
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,310
we will actually pick that off after

39
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,380
this session PFD for large packets is

40
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,850
also stable and more importantly Albert

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,560
has actually done some experimental work

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:02,209
and the frf routing stack to make use of

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,910
the feature and we see that it actually

44
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:07,640
does interact with itself in standard

45
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,230
mode and also journalist vmx and

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,640
potentially other stuff I have like two

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,369
slides I'll be flipping through that

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,779
I'll give you some data there it's

49
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,730
potentially ready for working group last

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,170
call we did a little bit more testing

51
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,048
with actual forwarding card Berg

52
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,850
considering that we know that no real

53
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,019
hardware makes a big difference for BFD

54
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,609
you know considering where it lives

55
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:29,870
inside and line charts in many cases one

56
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,790
point that we did actually want to take

57
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,840
a little bit time mature stuff and this

58
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,548
will be Mahesh the entity authentication

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,070
documents that we had specifically for

60
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:44,000
optimizing EFT and the procedures around

61
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:46,160
that had gone through last call had not

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,750
received a lot of no feedback no getting

63
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,359
glass coffee back and BFD sometimes

64
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:55,160
tricky as it stands the thing that was

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:58,130
the main sticking point was that his

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:03,609
former employer had done IPR declaration

67
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:07,190
on the stuff and the text of the

68
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,110
Declaration does no you follow the

69
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,840
standard IETF reasonable and

70
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,970
non-discriminatory you know status in

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,200
terms of what they are applying to be a

72
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,579
key around what is not on there is text

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,610
that we tend to see that is somewhat

74
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,520
comparable for Cisco and juniper as

75
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,669
examples where there's also a core

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,810
stating that this license tree or no its

77
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,810
license free and

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,500
the text in there does suggest that

79
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,990
license read it's potentially an option

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,130
but they also exclude cases where

81
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,590
licensing fees may be required I finish

82
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,969
did you want to comment on what the

83
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,969
iclear person actually had said directly

84
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,549
[Music]

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,530
right so what the legal department at

86
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,430
Siena which is the company that filed

87
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:13,609
the IPR said is that they looked at the

88
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,680
template of the IPS that had been

89
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:20,150
submitted against the BFD working group

90
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,060
and in their mind they kind of followed

91
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,099
middle of the line text as it was

92
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,880
concerned concerning this particular

93
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:31,580
patent and felt that their language was

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,240
no stronger no weaker than the other

95
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:38,508
part and the IPS that particular in the

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,419
BFD working group and so their summary

97
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:59,560
was essentially that they are no better

98
00:05:41,419 --> 00:06:04,400
no worse off then okay I'm not a expert

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:08,389
but we had discussion on a different

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:12,710
document and the document used the

101
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:16,000
similar to Siena language and that was

102
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:20,120
interpreted as clearly potential for

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,919
implementation so what they're saying is

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:33,469
I disagree there is clearly - there is a

105
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:37,008
clearly different disclosure language

106
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:39,389
that Jeff characterized and one of them

107
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:46,699
is characterized as covenant

108
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:49,919
which is different from friend and

109
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,909
covenant can be interpreted as a stick

110
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,448
behind your back

111
00:06:50,909 --> 00:07:02,849
so that says that I would not impose

112
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:06,449
royalties on unless you go after me okay

113
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:10,229
so that's I think that understood as

114
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:16,460
most common form of license disclosure

115
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:24,900
at ITF so if you go after me then I will

116
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:28,650
pull my guns and go after you yeah or

117
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:32,239
nuclear option yeah that's you know but

118
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:38,159
in legal terms it referred as a covenant

119
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,810
and and I think it's a mutually not

120
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,979
assertive is know one of the other terms

121
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,180
that I think popped up in that

122
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,339
conversation so it was clear in looking

123
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,469
at the back and forth that was forwarded

124
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,529
to us that the lawyer question did

125
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,599
understand what we were asking and it

126
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:57,210
was their opinion that you know the

127
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,878
disclosure as currently filed was

128
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,710
sufficient for that purpose the problem

129
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,860
is of course new promoters were talking

130
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,609
about and know exactly what

131
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,050
interpretation you're going to get is

132
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,699
good and they're the mood for the day to

133
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,650
be miserly so and unfortunately not to

134
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,509
try to belabor this one way or the other

135
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,948
because we're not going to necessarily

136
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,349
change their mind based on what we've

137
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,509
seen it's really if any of you have

138
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,279
relationships with CNN certainly feel

139
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:27,990
free to try to work into the backdoor

140
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,430
and talk about that but more importantly

141
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:35,519
in terms of what do we do as a working

142
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:37,380
group know if the the lawyer in question

143
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,089
did actually point out at least two

144
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,019
eyecare disclosures against fifty eight

145
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,449
eighty itself

146
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,790
know that word no not covered in similar

147
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,949
ways no lacuna francisco as we weren't

148
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,290
the only ones that file disclosures on

149
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:50,479
the technology and at least a couple of

150
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,040
those also

151
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,410
we're missing the nuclear options and

152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,769
there as well so there is precedent

153
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,889
within VFD of technologies you know

154
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:02,480
being covered in such a way we do have

155
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:03,350
the option that's a working group to

156
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,760
proceed

157
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,100
you know that's calling the documents

158
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,310
and just buying those their procedures

159
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,949
and the best thing we can actually say

160
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,250
is that no compared to some of the 5818

161
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:17,990
that I can afford the IPR declarations

162
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,500
that were referenced to us know as

163
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,329
comparisons but we do have other eyecare

164
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,610
against fifty eight eighty that NIF all

165
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:54,019
similar paths so we do have it with a

166
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:58,250
route well yes there is a history but

167
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:01,220
the thing is that always the question is

168
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:06,860
whether this IPR is applicable to

169
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:10,310
document and yes and and I know that

170
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,190
everyone has to decide and draw the

171
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,888
conclusion and we're not discussing like

172
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,589
they are here so that's what I want to

173
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:24,649
say is that even there might be a

174
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:29,589
disclosure which uses front language at

175
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:33,649
the time of progressing these documents

176
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:35,319
people might have decided that this IPR

177
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,930
is not applicable

178
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:44,149
that's one another thing is that what I

179
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:46,430
won't mention is that their update to

180
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:52,430
extended beef dealer will be presented

181
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:56,769
today will be on proposed authentication

182
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:59,510
option which functionally I believe

183
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,560
addresses was been addressed in this

184
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:07,730
draft

185
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:10,878
and as I understand even then there is

186
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:15,620
potential that IPR disclosure will be

187
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:21,339
filed but as I know their potential

188
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,339
holder of this IPR follows a covenant

189
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:27,319
it's reallyit a practice that if I care

190
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,600
is decided to be unacceptable for the

191
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:32,180
working group that alternative methods

192
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,559
can be so this is will be one of our

193
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,370
discussion points when we get around to

194
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,370
your presentation

195
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:40,850
yeah so I think where we are probably

196
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,769
add at this point is you know a bail

197
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,389
will go out to the mailing list to see

198
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,300
if people are willing to take down this

199
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:50,029
through the last call procedure and if

200
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,469
so well do I know editorial passed on

201
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,959
things since it has gone through last

202
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,569
call before and decide how to dispatch

203
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:00,349
from there but and these are they can

204
00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:01,939
hold up publication requests even if

205
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,550
they decide to move ahead or hold it

206
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:09,589
they stand for the discussion about

207
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:12,109
other mechanisms authentication just one

208
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:15,470
comment that case francisco there is an

209
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,389
RFC 47:36 and that hasn't similar kind

210
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,410
of issues and then he was published as

211
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,410
an informational RFC

212
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:42,430
again that's what I try to stress is

213
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:48,540
that the fact that there is a filed IPR

214
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:52,179
against the ITF document we all

215
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:57,309
encourage to look at IPR and see whether

216
00:12:52,179 --> 00:13:01,559
we believe it's applicable yes I myself

217
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:04,709
I look at some IPR with their front

218
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:07,569
covenant and looks like I said well I

219
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:11,949
would probably would not advise to file

220
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:15,309
it because it's not applicable okay but

221
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:17,410
there are different cases the IPR might

222
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:22,269
be not applicable and then yeah I would

223
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,259
support it because you know I want to

224
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,730
make sure I understand what you're

225
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:29,259
proposing here you proposing that we

226
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:33,370
look at the idea yes I propose that when

227
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:37,449
we when this mail goes for the working

228
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:42,100
group to consider how we proceed with

229
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:44,979
this draft is take your time do this

230
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,899
good service look at the IPR and decide

231
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:59,889
whether you believe it's applicable or

232
00:13:46,899 --> 00:14:03,249
not maja you were speaking as a routing

233
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:09,670
ad I agree with you like but on an

234
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:12,309
individual basis yeah but since you

235
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,469
didn't explicitly mention it and we were

236
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,790
missing work and yes operations yes

237
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,220
again

238
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:21,579
everyone has to come to this conclusion

239
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,639
himself at ITF and I was told many times

240
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:27,699
now I learned it we are not discussing

241
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:32,129
applicability for IPR so that's why I'm

242
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:32,128
not really saying what I believe in

243
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:43,670
you're American our point but we must

244
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,800
keep in mind that whatever we may agree

245
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,949
on with respect to the applicability of

246
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,349
IPR we're not accrued that will decide

247
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,090
and so the ITF consensus or working with

248
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,640
businesses on that won't prove anything

249
00:14:53,090 --> 00:15:02,030
on what may happen in front of a curve

250
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:08,060
so you must be careful with that yes I

251
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:13,280
agree so if somebody has access to IPR

252
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:19,689
War expertise you can ask them to give

253
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:23,780
you more professional judgment but again

254
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:27,130
by reading their document I think that

255
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:30,350
we can come to the reasonable conclusion

256
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,130
sufficient to basically saying well

257
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,710
there is no risk because it's kind of

258
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:40,000
stretched too far or saying well it's a

259
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,000
pretty much close call

260
00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:00,180
David black TSP WG working group chair

261
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,310
got up basically a plus-one Gregg's

262
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,519
comments that I think the the big take

263
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,109
where how people take from this is that

264
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,449
nothing substitutes for your own

265
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,790
technical judgment about what is going

266
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:16,219
on please don't get carried away

267
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,219
focusing solely on what the lawyers did

268
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:29,029
there's no feedback I'm going to just

269
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,189
quickly flash through two slides from

270
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:35,069
Albert on DMT for large packets cited

271
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,810
that take the session time and not

272
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:40,110
actually spend it on nothing for the

273
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,689
presentation Albert did actually do so a

274
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,759
little bit of changes to the Fri routing

275
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,019
stack you know end up being you know a

276
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,649
couple lines of code is we are all

277
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:52,740
discussing all the padding was actually

278
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:55,740
done at the IP layer and tested this

279
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,139
note versus the unmodified that for our

280
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,930
stack and also the dmx stack from

281
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,839
juniper which is a virtual machine based

282
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,980
forwarding stack and you know the

283
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,740
feature does seem to work as expected

284
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,390
and now in case you want to actually dig

285
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,900
into the back of contents you needed to

286
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,459
does apply that as well so I think

287
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,020
partially with this is just a vacation

288
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,339
once we get a little bit bored in Iraq

289
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
we may actually move forward with the

290
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,220
last call on this feature ended up being

291
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,049
probably about as simple as we were

292
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,209
expecting it to I think the only

293
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,429
interesting potential holdup is how we

294
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:33,270
give DV to discussions and that

295
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:37,500
resolving did you want to say this for

296
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:39,500
your presentation breaker so how is

297
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,569
first okay thank you

298
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,569
[Music]

299
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:54,559
ready for your minutes

300
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:21,950
this might work yeah good good afternoon

301
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:25,040
I guess Sterling's afternoon so my name

302
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:30,620
is Sami Boutros was VMware so I'm

303
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:34,010
presenting this draft is this there a

304
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:37,939
draft here about how can be a big help

305
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:49,490
with some service with an OSI so next

306
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:52,970
slide okay thank you so so yeah how's

307
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:56,480
things this slide has most of the

308
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:01,210
information that I would like to

309
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,970
describe here so the idea here is that

310
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:08,900
you know in in a network where we want

311
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:12,460
to offer service redundancy across

312
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,630
multiple nodes like shown here so those

313
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,900
services could be layered - or layer 3

314
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,990
or even layer four services or even

315
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,290
there seven so we have multiple nodes

316
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,980
offering the services and in general

317
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:31,280
especially layer for services and above

318
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,200
are offered in active standby mode not

319
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,080
really in active active because they

320
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,580
tend to create state related to the

321
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:46,960
flows passing by the nodes so as either

322
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,960
here in such use case when such Network

323
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:55,550
we typically would have a protocol like

324
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:58,850
PFD to check the liveness between the

325
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:01,460
node offering the service actively and

326
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,100
the standby note just in case I know the

327
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:10,870
offering service actively goes down then

328
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:13,459
the standby node will take over right so

329
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:17,030
with those services sometimes as well

330
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,240
after a failure we need to support what

331
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,879
we call non-relative mood not reverted

332
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,760
meaning that if

333
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,100
the standby takes over a given service

334
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,060
then we don't want that service to go

335
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,399
back to the active when he comes back up

336
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,500
so now if you are running BFD between

337
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,230
the nodes the active and standby and

338
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:44,750
sent by detected that the active went

339
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:48,380
down he will take over but now in the

340
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:51,470
active comes back up and the VIP session

341
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,630
between the old active and the standby

342
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:59,540
who recently got activated comes back up

343
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,190
we need some how to tell the standbys

344
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:06,610
that became active to tell the old

345
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:09,760
active that I was up while you were down

346
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,830
so and we are supporting non-relative

347
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,900
for this service or for whatever

348
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:18,070
services that we are offering as it's

349
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:22,250
being offered here was redundancy by us

350
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:25,820
so don't take back don't take over the

351
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:31,040
service that you were active or so so so

352
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:33,770
for that we we are talking about a small

353
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,580
extension to be a D and you diet code by

354
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:40,580
which a node that service that detected

355
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:44,419
the failure of another node I can tell

356
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,480
that other node when comes back up that

357
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,880
I was up while you were down and that

358
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,490
would help as I mentioned in the non

359
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,000
revert of keys meaning he is an inverter

360
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,070
case all the active as I was explaining

361
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,790
wouldn't take over the service because

362
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,860
the standby was survived as a failure or

363
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,290
was active during the video of course if

364
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,050
both the active and standby went down

365
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:11,690
then the standby wouldn't activate any

366
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,970
saying because both failed and that that

367
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,950
code was not used what we are proposing

368
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,540
further here and I guess it will be part

369
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,590
of another discussions that will be done

370
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:27,770
the working group later today is using

371
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:31,189
the payload to to communicate some

372
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:36,410
optional bitmap about the services that

373
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:39,890
are offered by Z notes here so so

374
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,020
so especially in sauna relative mode is

375
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,960
an example I just mentioned if the

376
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:47,960
standby is activated for the service it

377
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,470
can send the back code and optionally

378
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:56,020
can send a bitmap of the service that it

379
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:58,640
took over right so it tells active yes I

380
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:06,500
we are honoring the deliberative mode

381
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:08,930
and I am going to take over those I

382
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,660
already took oversee those set of

383
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:14,450
services described in a bitmap that can

384
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,420
be configured by a controller that you

385
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:22,100
saw in the picture on the first slide so

386
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:26,060
so I think here was that that's about it

387
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:30,080
so they knew that code is that this node

388
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:32,330
was up was the peer note field is what

389
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,040
we are extending and of course as a

390
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,840
bitmap would be part of the v2

391
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,990
discussion so any comments yes sorry go

392
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,470
ahead

393
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:43,670
a cylinder Cisco Systems so you're going

394
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:48,010
to have a single B of D session have

395
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:51,350
different preamp statuses dependent on

396
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:54,290
the diag code you know like if you have

397
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:58,340
more than one service some would I don't

398
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:00,680
know it's not a service that's a PFD

399
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,300
session for the liveness of cynuit

400
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,180
no I know I know that I know that but

401
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:08,210
you're having but but but it's usually

402
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,650
it's all or not right all services or no

403
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,570
services right that's the way it is

404
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,190
today we have preamp mode we already

405
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,639
have this revert of non revert oh that's

406
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:20,110
been a BFT since the the beginning right

407
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:25,370
you know no oh wait I'm thinking a br oh

408
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:29,449
yeah okay oh it's VR okay that's so it's

409
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:35,270
really simple then yeah okay I'm okay

410
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:37,130
sure thanks Sam Waldron I have one

411
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:41,780
fundamental question here are you sure

412
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:45,170
yeah so you are monitoring the link

413
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,970
between the nodes as it may not be a

414
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,710
link right you know no I mean the bf

415
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,470
decision

416
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:54,960
so an

417
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:57,450
putting that as node failure correct but

418
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,700
that may not be right sorry how can you

419
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,080
oh okay I think I think what you are

420
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,289
talking about cases whether you have a

421
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:08,370
split brain for example right and so on

422
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:10,289
right so so this is you have a point in

423
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,809
split brain kind of scenario in which

424
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:14,549
maybe both of them will sink the other

425
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,090
guys down they didn't survive the

426
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:20,730
failure but at least when they come back

427
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:24,120
up especially for non-relative service

428
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:26,940
if one of them is saying okay hey I was

429
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,979
up then the other guy can figure out

430
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,230
okay yeah he was up he took over

431
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,330
services maybe I should bring it down on

432
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,159
my side if the split bring it correctly

433
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,970
but but the assumption you're making is

434
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,720
that the connectivity between nodes is

435
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,140
equivalent to the north failure you're

436
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,030
right

437
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,070
but it's not a node failure in split

438
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,260
brain scenarios this is what but we can

439
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,809
definitely put some clarification on

440
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,379
split brain if split brain would happen

441
00:25:51,809 --> 00:26:03,690
then what should be the behavior thank

442
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:08,340
you growing risk is et regarding so one

443
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,770
question is that you think that only

444
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:15,510
scenarios that you need to cover are

445
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:19,049
when you have active and standby that

446
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:24,929
you cannot have more nodes that can be

447
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:29,330
provide the service the same service so

448
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:32,970
saying that you might have three nodes

449
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:38,549
one is active standby and other is dr

450
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:40,169
other so once for example and there

451
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:43,049
might be interesting scenarios for

452
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:44,820
example your standby goes down and the

453
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:50,700
other becomes a standby

454
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:54,059
oh you're our active goes down then

455
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,679
standby takes as active and other

456
00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:01,770
becomes standby correct so what i'm

457
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,780
driving to is that is the point to point

458
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,670
B if d

459
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,830
is the best mechanism might be look at B

460
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:13,010
of D for multi-point networks because

461
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:17,199
what we found is at four scenarios and

462
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,950
AC mentioned vrrp for VRP

463
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,460
point-to-multipoint

464
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,240
works very nicely and

465
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,590
point-to-multipoint

466
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:30,430
i'm for sure for multiple networks so

467
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:34,429
now it's at the RFC 85/60 - I believe

468
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:40,940
works nicely for case or for example T

469
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:45,680
MSM when you have multiple PSM routers

470
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:50,140
on a shared segment so basically your

471
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:56,230
active just has is a head end of the

472
00:27:50,140 --> 00:28:01,580
session and all others they are or vdr

473
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:05,330
back up or others are listening and in

474
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:11,449
that we might think about how to insert

475
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:14,300
the notion of whether active is non

476
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,910
revert if saying that I'm non reverted

477
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:22,220
and regardless of your priority you

478
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:25,490
should wait till I go down okay so let's

479
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,550
might be I say to the list and talk

480
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:31,940
about and think whether

481
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:35,419
point-to-multipoint BFD is provide more

482
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,550
generic solution because otherwise you

483
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,070
have to have multiplicity of point

484
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:44,120
opponent session for the same service I

485
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:46,189
think yeah in the document we are we

486
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,850
described on the one use case in which

487
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:52,850
the service is active standby so so we

488
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:55,520
don't have the other but definitely I

489
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:59,540
mean you know it could be an option to

490
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,750
consider write other stuff but is that I

491
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:08,180
could hear that how helpful that I could

492
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:11,930
is is simply to say I was up when you

493
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,090
went down and and and and you know or I

494
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:16,070
think I was up when when you were when I

495
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,709
detected that you are down and of course

496
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,720
you

497
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,990
using that capability you can build on

498
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,610
it many many other use cases not only

499
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:28,340
tsunami were close to ten minutes behind

500
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:31,620
schedule so after after Santos

501
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:35,070
discussions to the list base okay on

502
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,779
Sunday show me may I just have a comment

503
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,059
on this particular pick Matt but we are

504
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,559
sending it's a it's a come it's a

505
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,990
comment for the working group itself

506
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,360
like time and again we are introducing

507
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:48,210
you know new new payloads for BFD and

508
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,340
increasing the IP être so I guess this

509
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,760
should be considered for be of devotion

510
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,500
to or the external pfb where we just

511
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,158
introduced this as a capability and you

512
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,020
know negotiate probably we can just wait

513
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,850
for that discussion sure exactly and

514
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:10,020
yeah how we'll be looking forward for a

515
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:10,918
discussion - thank you thanks so it

516
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,500
sounds like we have some good discussion

517
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,210
the Q&A mailing list I do agree that the

518
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,750
point-to-multipoint is probably a better

519
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,549
technologies set in question dispense

520
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,279
bring us to where do we put the rest the

521
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:34,799
data and community Gregg is gonna pick

522
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:39,110
up off that question then how appreciate

523
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:43,789
if you help me yeah thank you okay so

524
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:46,320
let's go to the next right away so again

525
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:50,490
quickly go further what we talked about

526
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,240
in Prague the motivation is there been

527
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:59,750
several ideas of what we want to do with

528
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,250
BFD one of them is to monitor and

529
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:06,809
quantify the quality of these sessions

530
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:11,270
so because normally BFD is used for the

531
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:15,090
detect multiplier 3 which means that

532
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:19,830
there might be loss of up to to BFD

533
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:22,620
control packets and still though this

534
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:25,168
session will stay up but that might be

535
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,820
used as some indicator of the problem in

536
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:31,190
the network sort of

537
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:35,189
very crude performance monitoring method

538
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:38,570
saying if we say that you're losing two

539
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,919
packets out of three that's some clue

540
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:46,678
then the performance measurement and

541
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:49,619
path into you wash packets so we're

542
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:54,499
trying to use existing mechanics that

543
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:56,389
we've deep revised and numerous

544
00:31:54,499 --> 00:32:01,219
implementations and many implementations

545
00:31:56,389 --> 00:32:07,198
hardware-assisted to do more things just

546
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:13,009
that continuty verification so what we

547
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:16,049
said the goal is that it has to be

548
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:20,519
backward compatible and extensible

549
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:24,469
mechanism so in another motivation is

550
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:26,339
that to provide somewhat intermediate

551
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:31,279
authentication for beef this session

552
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:36,509
because there what we discussed first

553
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:38,969
the proposal was addressing it to more

554
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:41,519
white weight authentication because

555
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:46,019
otherwise authentication is the very

556
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:48,719
computational heavy especially if there

557
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:52,879
are a synchronous mode at three point

558
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:57,919
three millisecond next slide please

559
00:32:52,879 --> 00:33:01,408
so the proposal is that to use or reuse

560
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,979
BFD control message as is as defined in

561
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:09,599
58 80 well we thought of some guard word

562
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:12,440
is additional possible way of saying

563
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,458
well it's just random memory or it's

564
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:21,929
really extended BFD let's discuss it and

565
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:25,489
then followed by tod as very generic and

566
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:29,069
commonly accepted method of doing

567
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:32,609
extensibility till these can be enclosed

568
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:34,829
so the obituaries and sub t Okies and

569
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:38,770
let's see what it gives us

570
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:42,460
next slide please so

571
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:45,190
for the extended capability it starts

572
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:52,480
with a capability negotiation which is

573
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:56,140
done for their paw sequence by default

574
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:01,090
there is no extended VFD and then the

575
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:04,120
active node advertises its capability of

576
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:09,610
what is being requested and capability

577
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:18,629
negotiation can be done at any state of

578
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:21,490
DFD so for now we are considering to do

579
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,500
was delay measurement and was the

580
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:30,779
measurement could be either periodic

581
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:35,739
appalled periodic it's thinking of being

582
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:38,800
done in a synchronous mode or might be

583
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:41,168
demand mode so where the packets

584
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,169
periodically sent and given in the

585
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:48,460
configured interval when we talk about

586
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:50,918
this in Prague it was a very good

587
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,840
question about okay what do we want to

588
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:58,210
do in three point three milliseconds

589
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:00,190
well if somebody proposes you that they

590
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,800
want to do periodic for example last

591
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,900
measurement the other side might say

592
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,290
well I'm not doing it three point three

593
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:12,460
milliseconds I can do at 100

594
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:14,920
milliseconds so the paw sequence allows

595
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:20,200
an already existing mechanism of saying

596
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:22,630
well how about this oh no I'm not doing

597
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,950
this and they they can negotiate what

598
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:28,440
they do they my arrived

599
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:35,339
conclusion that okay it's it would not

600
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:39,000
work and that would be fine so that's

601
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:41,549
basically again existing nice

602
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,589
functionality of DFD the paw sequence

603
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:50,220
that it's negotiation which is comes to

604
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:53,640
certain conclusion indicated by setting

605
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:59,459
the final bit and now we're introducing

606
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:02,328
their lightweight authentication we can

607
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,329
go to the next slide

608
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:11,940
grep now just ensure so are you

609
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:19,500
proposing to decouple liveliness from

610
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:24,599
the new capabilities again there could

611
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:28,950
be that ravenous would be monitored by

612
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:32,160
one give this session and another be of

613
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:35,700
this session may be brought up for

614
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,740
extended but at the same time what I

615
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:45,450
would like to point is that there Paul

616
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:48,270
Moe so everything can be done in poem

617
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:52,680
ode and Paul molt is a query

618
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:57,480
it's a waked ping-pong mod in post

619
00:36:52,680 --> 00:37:00,589
sequence and BFD works as a query so one

620
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,829
sense the poor another looks at it and

621
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:10,710
responds either with its Paul or with

622
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:13,560
the final so it's more on-demand mode so

623
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:17,550
basically on-demand mode of excusing

624
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:21,660
extension I believe can be coupled with

625
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:25,410
their continued connectivity

626
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:28,140
verification continue to check with a

627
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:30,450
regular BFD a synchronous mode you

628
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,029
envision that you would still do

629
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:37,470
continuty at three point three but would

630
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:38,299
send delay measurement every xx packet

631
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,299
packet

632
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:45,288
or how do you see two disjoint timers

633
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:49,819
working together that's a good question

634
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:51,890
I need to look at how we can control the

635
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:54,949
frequency of the pole through this

636
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:59,179
negotiation yeah maybe it will require

637
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:02,539
additional specification when we do

638
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:04,939
capability for the pole that we need to

639
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:06,859
negotiate the timing of this yeah it's a

640
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:10,549
good question thank you great Santosh

641
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:12,140
from BMA now with this negotiation

642
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:14,929
capability if you are doing in the same

643
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,999
session right so if you are doing a pole

644
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:19,759
and that guy doesn't support this and

645
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:23,569
it's not sending a final eccentric that

646
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:28,309
will bring down the session well again

647
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:31,910
as I mentioned I think that this

648
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:35,779
capability negotiation can be done at

649
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:38,538
any stage so for example so the regular

650
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:41,959
B of this session is already up then we

651
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:46,160
want to negotiate saying that okay I

652
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:48,709
want to have was--and delay measurement

653
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,410
done in a poor mode using poor sequence

654
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:53,479
and as Jeff suggested that yes we need

655
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,808
to specify what would be the frequency

656
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:59,178
of this measurements and the others say

657
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:02,239
size says now I don't want to do it at

658
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:03,559
all now in this case I'm saying that the

659
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,959
other guy just doesn't support the

660
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,819
expended VFD yeah so in this case you're

661
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:09,229
sending a pool and he's not replying

662
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,089
back to you because it's just dropping

663
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:15,078
back oh okay

664
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:19,299
if other guy doesn't support Paul you

665
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:21,160
should still you operate in the normal

666
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:24,799
classical beauty

667
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,618
so because currently in 500 0 if pole is

668
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:30,788
not responded with the final 4 3 packets

669
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:33,979
we just drop the paper I know right if

670
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:38,239
again that's basically what I'm

671
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:40,549
suggesting that if no external BD and I

672
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,589
think that there is some wording in a

673
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:46,969
document we discussed that I'm sorry we

674
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:51,069
discussed in Prague is that if extended

675
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:53,109
Paul doesn't go so their sender has

676
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:56,380
conclude the other side doesn't support

677
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:59,348
the extended BFD and can revert back to

678
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:04,380
classical bfd2 basically he will need to

679
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:07,059
send normal paul without extension and

680
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:14,769
just negotiate the timer's not the

681
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:17,589
capabilities okay okay so authentication

682
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:21,209
capability their authentication field in

683
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:27,130
the capability of e is a variable length

684
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:29,680
field which characterizes what the

685
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:35,229
length of authentication and what the

686
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:39,098
authentication type are supported by the

687
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:42,009
sender and the idea is that if they both

688
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:44,799
support extended BFD ml or support light

689
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:48,309
wave authentication they advertise their

690
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:54,459
capability and then they select the

691
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:57,959
their largest authentication and the

692
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,959
highest authentication mode

693
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:10,670
currently we're proposing couple modes

694
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:16,010
one of them so basically since there was

695
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:21,160
a discussion that password and md5 are

696
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:23,600
not sufficient not including it but if

697
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,580
community and working group believes

698
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,370
that they should be excluded included

699
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:32,170
then obviously it's all just you know

700
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:34,730
just to have a discussion there is

701
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:39,500
existing spec and how to do like no

702
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:41,420
sha-1 chou to for VFD statments we've

703
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,180
worked through before and it fits into

704
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,890
the existing VFD header how is this

705
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,660
supposed to be different with it or

706
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:53,540
you're not to know you're at that older

707
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:57,109
set specs how to do it or no again the

708
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:02,450
known this shaft one and meticulous chef

709
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:04,970
one it will be done the same way the

710
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:08,210
capability here rather than the existing

711
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:10,939
authentication header quite well because

712
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:16,700
the thing is that existing

713
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:19,490
authentication header is that it tied to

714
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,419
the configuration so they're in an

715
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:26,299
existing 58 80 definition of how we do

716
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,400
authentication and BFD is once it's

717
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,400
configured it has to be an issue in

718
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,830
every packet what we're proposing is

719
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,550
that authentication capability is only

720
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:40,009
used in the poll sequence this is for

721
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,910
the occasional yes is that clear finish

722
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:46,130
line yes it's it's actually

723
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:48,770
authentication is explicitly not to be

724
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:53,200
well at least we are not proposing to be

725
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:55,850
done in periodic messages because it and

726
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:00,410
we have this discussion with the other

727
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:02,900
proposal that if we do this in theoretic

728
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:06,009
messages it creates a lot of complexity

729
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,840
of when do you declare your session down

730
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:11,780
with authentication capability if it's

731
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:15,320
done in the poll then you even if your

732
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:17,870
litigation fails you can receive

733
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,690
whether you're not receiving final bid

734
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,670
or you receive the final with the error

735
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,310
code we're introducing the error code

736
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,080
here and then you can draw the

737
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,759
conclusion what you do with the session

738
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:34,940
you can take the session down or you

739
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:37,010
will say okay since I think you could be

740
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,720
very the next conversation but that's

741
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,220
about the next slide deck we're starting

742
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,459
to see people drift out of the room and

743
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,279
okay there we go okay so yeah you can go

744
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,020
for the slides which explain how the

745
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:59,810
authentication works and how it's being

746
00:43:48,020 --> 00:44:02,750
used no further the flow chart yeah the

747
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:06,350
flow chart and then and the only thing

748
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:10,520
is that authentication can be combined

749
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:12,440
with other extensions but if it's the

750
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,370
case then authentication obviously has

751
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,970
to be the last Tod so just we move along

752
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:21,920
to the next piece of slides that I have

753
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:25,100
not to kick off the detail presentation

754
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:44,030
if you have is there a question on this

755
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:46,549
yeah the records from Cisco so so so for

756
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,540
tuam we had control channel signaling

757
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:51,920
and I think you introduced them to

758
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,900
eliminate some of this control channel

759
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,230
signaling and complexity in the network

760
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:00,650
to simplify you know using to operate

761
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:03,680
using the provisioning model so by

762
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:07,100
adding a lot more complexity in this

763
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,960
capability and and signaling in BFD I

764
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:17,569
think we're going in the other direction

765
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:20,690
for BFD partial jump off actually I want

766
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,340
to say that in the stamp we put up the

767
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,950
requirement that there is a backward

768
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,310
compatibility with the tier employed in

769
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,430
uncirculated mode

770
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:36,850
and there are special mechanism in stamp

771
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:39,640
that ensures this so here what we are

772
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:44,160
putting is that ensuring the backward

773
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:46,600
compatibility with the classical B of D

774
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,069
we move into the next bit of the

775
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,080
conversation so I'm just going to kick

776
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,600
this off harshly with some slides we had

777
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,730
at Prague you know what's our

778
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,819
motivations for extending things no we

779
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,380
we had VF e is a very thin protocol you

780
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,869
know the question I always ask is what

781
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,550
you want to do every three milliseconds

782
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:06,550
our extensions can't break our core use

783
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:08,290
cases and we've said no a lot over the

784
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,940
years to try to keep these things true

785
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,900
and you still managed to do extensions

786
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:16,960
when they made sense we've talked about

787
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,730
you know the how can we extend no I sort

788
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,109
of opened up the Genie model by showing

789
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,180
that we can stick stuff at the end of

790
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:24,900
the package the visitor has been holding

791
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,069
my back pocket for a number of years I

792
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,320
however does it interact with

793
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:32,619
authentication as it's specified in the

794
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,450
core draft right now a BF d v2 could

795
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:36,100
obviously solve a lot of these things

796
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,868
without going through a bunch of tricks

797
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,940
and I suspect that Square will get drift

798
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:42,460
driven very quickly and will figure out

799
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:45,580
that for compatibilities work we know

800
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,500
that fast things in tlvs don't usually

801
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,660
get along one of the things we do tend

802
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:52,090
to see that does work around for that IP

803
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,940
fix as an example has the idea of

804
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,010
templates that allow you to send

805
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,010
information very quickly it's still

806
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:03,580
structured so there's ways around what

807
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:05,050
the new but really the motivation to

808
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,869
thank you all they're coming here you

809
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,160
know from outside the usual DFG stuff

810
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:11,710
the bigger question is you know it's

811
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,868
time you open up the conversation you

812
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:17,260
know why why are we trying to do some of

813
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:19,230
the stuff in DFT and know we have as

814
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,330
examples of stuff that we've done before

815
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,740
you know we have some of the timing loss

816
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:26,049
delay measurement type stuff that has

817
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,060
been previously covered by ITT M type

818
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:30,460
stuff they obviously have their iom work

819
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,420
and how that might Interlake here is one

820
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,290
of the interesting pieces the

821
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,579
conversation when we start adding a new

822
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,558
stuff maybe

823
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:40,869
it was the example for your presentation

824
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,479
if we're in ldm mode we might actually

825
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:45,099
want to either spin up a new session we

826
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:47,259
might want to downshift our speed

827
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:49,509
well there's obviously changes to the

828
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:51,579
coracle PFD is going to behave in such

829
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:54,069
circumstances so already at the point of

830
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:54,699
this isn't really no standard PFD

831
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:57,459
anymore

832
00:47:54,699 --> 00:48:00,249
and you know the bigger problem for us

833
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:02,709
no perspective our ad is at least things

834
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:04,749
are sort of weekly and charter to start

835
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:07,178
with and you keep on getting pressure to

836
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:08,578
open things up and the the reason why I

837
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:11,799
may need to really look at this stuff

838
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:13,119
comes down to I think a very simple

839
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:13,538
thing I mentioned this on the mailing

840
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,289
list

841
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:18,999
now BST is a popular protocol for the

842
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:20,920
same reason that things like BGP and VMs

843
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:23,769
are popular it has a particular

844
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,650
structure that is appealing to certain

845
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:29,529
types work of HP's popular for inter

846
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:31,539
domain that's what's used for DNS is a

847
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:33,969
effectively distributed database which

848
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:36,400
design the thing that's sort of popular

849
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:39,519
about PFD is that it's a continuous

850
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,019
channel between two systems and provides

851
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,198
a place where you can potentially put

852
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:46,629
all sorts of interesting things

853
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,459
so you know using this as a motivation

854
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,079
for discussion and this is where I'd

855
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:52,828
like to see by more participation from

856
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,839
people from outside of the birkin group

857
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:57,819
if T might be an interesting channel we

858
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,880
don't necessarily have to put things

859
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:03,549
into the core BFP you know 50 80 80 case

860
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,559
itself you know it's a great mechanism

861
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:08,009
for doing our continuity checks it's

862
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:11,140
very popular it's very successful

863
00:49:08,009 --> 00:49:13,029
nothing stops us from taking exactly the

864
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,819
same mechanism set that's made DFT

865
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:18,849
popular and potentially just cloning it

866
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:21,459
off into different UDP port different

867
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:23,079
capsulation type something that runs at

868
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,209
a different speed you know that can

869
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:26,920
carry along expiry formation when it

870
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:28,448
makes sense for this conversation

871
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,229
perpetual conversation between two

872
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:35,289
systems so the question I like the sea

873
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:37,660
to the room is knows like we don't have

874
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:41,189
to change vfe itself from the core use

875
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:45,399
case as we start expanding things out -

876
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:46,879
this is a nice property so does this

877
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,829
make sense to

878
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,930
hand this off to a different working

879
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:54,470
group as an example it would for example

880
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:56,269
I TPM benefit from having a EFT like no

881
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:59,569
exchange where they can profound things

882
00:49:56,269 --> 00:50:03,169
like IOM oriented a situation where

883
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:06,170
there's other ITF om mechanisms because

884
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:09,769
ITF really doesn't do am your your big

885
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:11,000
your big advocate of it is there other

886
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:13,129
groups that we should let me start

887
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,440
having this conversation with and it was

888
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:24,980
the room actually Jeff what I want to

889
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:27,529
note is that at least authentication

890
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,869
what we want to do we want to do

891
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:33,490
identification of that particular

892
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:35,390
session not the parallel session because

893
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:39,169
authenticating per little session

894
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:40,460
doesn't really serve the purpose and

895
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,950
that strongly souls when we were doing

896
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,630
the identification you know we you

897
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:46,250
obviously have a body of work that had

898
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:50,240
gotten always last call covering

899
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:54,170
authentication so that's yeah but but

900
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:58,578
for again there were proposals and I

901
00:50:54,170 --> 00:51:01,609
talked with a one of the offers of the

902
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:04,220
quality of DFD session and again if we

903
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:05,890
want to quantify their quality of VD

904
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,509
session who probably want to quantify

905
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,190
quality of that particular bit this

906
00:51:08,509 --> 00:51:11,960
session

907
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:14,450
it's very my quality of the FD session

908
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,049
is that something that's were of an IgM

909
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:20,000
type discussion

910
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:21,740
I mean you could do that without I um

911
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:35,599
now she Frankie is lining up there and

912
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:37,939
you see the same thing so Matthew Bakshi

913
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,059
not here so this discussion reminds me

914
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:45,859
of the same deliberations you went

915
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:48,829
through with MPLS TP and we discussed

916
00:51:45,859 --> 00:51:50,720
using back in the day using BFD to do l

917
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:53,720
MDM and all these other functions that

918
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,859
were required for STP and we decided not

919
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,368
to it because we all wrote either

920
00:51:54,859 --> 00:52:00,270
already had tools to do that or we

921
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:02,460
didn't we didn't want to overload

922
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:05,100
the nice lightweight fast mechanism that

923
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,290
we had with BFD and we went about as far

924
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,759
as extending BFD in the sense that we

925
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,920
allowed it to do connectivity

926
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,590
verification as well as connectivity

927
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:18,750
check and we used a separate control

928
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:20,640
channel for doing that so we then went

929
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:24,740
ahead and created all these other like

930
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:27,420
MDM for MPLS performance monitoring and

931
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,799
created a kind of a framework where you

932
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,620
could you could slaughter in all these

933
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:35,430
different tools nicely in the MPLS

934
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:37,799
context to run together so so I guess

935
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:40,440
the question is why specifically do you

936
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,150
want to use or replicate these

937
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,270
mechanisms or replicate similar

938
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:47,420
functionality and BFD when we already

939
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:52,230
have these tools they're already working

940
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:55,860
well actually in regard to proposal to

941
00:52:52,230 --> 00:53:01,710
you to do performance monitoring with a

942
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:06,180
PFD it doesn't add it reuses 63 74 so

943
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:10,080
it's reuses there are messages defined

944
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:15,950
in was and delay measurement in MPLS

945
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:18,600
networks right but it's not 63 74

946
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:20,430
specifically and you already have those

947
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,500
tools you know you already have tools

948
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:27,120
for doing an awesome place well the

949
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:29,640
thing is that 6-3 74 only defines the

950
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,759
format it doesn't define how you do

951
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:35,190
testing

952
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,310
how you doing ago she ation and if I

953
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:42,570
remember correctly there was even an

954
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:46,830
issue with a unidirectional measurement

955
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:53,100
so because you know if receive receiver

956
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:56,910
receives this metrics so what did you do

957
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:59,700
so they had to invent extension saying

958
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:02,540
okay you take this and then you forward

959
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:08,430
to somewhere else

960
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:11,910
63 74 is it's a nice mechanism and I

961
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:14,640
like it because it uses

962
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:18,149
fixed messages that are symmetrical in

963
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:23,609
size if it's done one-sided two-way

964
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:28,759
measurement but I think that it works

965
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:33,799
some of their mechanics and as Jeff said

966
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:37,130
BFD provides a mechanism and for example

967
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:42,210
this measurements doesn't have to be

968
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:44,880
done on three point three millisecond

969
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:49,400
the measurements can be done using the

970
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:55,410
pole sequence in a way how for example

971
00:54:49,400 --> 00:55:03,329
stamp works send a reflector and provide

972
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:05,339
very nice performance monitoring - it

973
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:07,170
sounds like you're basically reusing the

974
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:08,970
negotiation capabilities from bf take

975
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,170
for these other various tools rather

976
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,089
than it's not strictly be of take

977
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:15,990
anymore yes

978
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:20,460
and that's another like reuse rather

979
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:22,859
invent so we if we that's another

980
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:26,609
motivation yes we have this nice tool of

981
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:34,319
Paul sequence negotiation and why not

982
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:37,589
use it for the other purpose front

983
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:40,019
proper Cisco well I think negotiation

984
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:46,109
and maybe also kind of more flexible

985
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:47,879
authentication I gather for doing things

986
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:51,808
that embark into performance

987
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:54,619
measurements I'm not entirely sure right

988
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:57,210
because I think one of the assets I

989
00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:00,930
think you price it very well earlier on

990
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:03,599
is B of leagues accept it because it's

991
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:08,609
simple and you can't put loads of

992
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:11,130
into it which is why people run it if we

993
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:14,369
are opening up that to be really

994
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:18,630
flexible just that hamper acceptance I

995
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:20,579
don't know because we could also and

996
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,619
maybe we should go before jumping into

997
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:24,569
the extensibility debate we should go

998
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,230
and figure out what we want to go and do

999
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:27,509
and

1000
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:31,560
we can go do what exactly execs it is

1001
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:35,010
exact sorry existing tools if you have a

1002
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,590
set parallel session that runs tym stamp

1003
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:41,730
whatever what can you get from that if

1004
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:43,440
you put stuff like IOM into the messages

1005
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:46,200
that you're exchanging what can you get

1006
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,600
from that and based on that maybe can

1007
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,939
come to a conclusion where we say well

1008
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,920
this is a specific app that is small

1009
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,740
enough so that we're not overloading the

1010
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,750
if they but at the same time we're not

1011
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,700
replicating all that other stuff because

1012
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:02,520
once you're opening up the thing to be

1013
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:05,220
doing anything then you might actually

1014
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,280
hamper B if these acceptance and that

1015
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,589
might be bad right because we don't want

1016
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,359
to go and lose this asset that we indeed

1017
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:14,250
ran it run a channel between two

1018
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:16,890
entities that might not even be friendly

1019
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:18,810
to each other to the extent I'm

1020
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,310
connecting two different domains and I

1021
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:25,430
still want to go and tell you that my

1022
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:30,660
router went down yeah I would note that

1023
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:36,330
IOM is one way measurement and basically

1024
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:39,330
it has a problem that was found in 63 74

1025
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:42,470
one way measurements that what you do

1026
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:47,520
with this metrics you need to export it

1027
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:50,009
what nice about using po sequence for

1028
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,100
performance measurement it's yes it's

1029
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:56,790
similar to tea womp and stamp is that

1030
00:57:53,100 --> 00:58:00,569
this is a one-sided two-way measurement

1031
00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:02,580
so basically the sender receives the

1032
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:06,240
measurement results and can calculate

1033
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:10,619
the metrics and that's usually the more

1034
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:14,729
operationally friendly mode right but

1035
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:18,350
again so that's why I would not compare

1036
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:18,350
IO am over this proposal

1037
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:28,310
santosh so my take on this is you know

1038
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:30,150
let's not open up B of T for the entire

1039
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:33,480
capabilities that we can do with other

1040
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:35,940
protocols but at the same time we really

1041
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,980
really need this some bit of an

1042
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,700
extension to be F T the reason being

1043
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,640
that you know

1044
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,710
we have done BFD stability draught which

1045
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,779
is like you know where we really want to

1046
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:48,359
see if the BFD packets were getting draw

1047
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:52,260
right I mean it was happening because in

1048
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:53,670
you know in one of the hardware the BFG

1049
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:55,380
packets were getting robbed in the host

1050
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:57,420
path when the packet was received while

1051
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:01,500
the link was up everything was working

1052
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:04,020
fine so this was one of the features

1053
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:07,170
that we really wanted to enable and

1054
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:09,420
disable on the fly for a given B of

1055
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,760
decision so b FD itself we wanted to see

1056
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:15,030
whether it is stable or not having said

1057
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,240
that the bitmap that Sammy just

1058
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:21,300
explained a good thing for service that

1059
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:24,149
he wants to you know negotiate for that

1060
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:26,369
matter he has come up with Greg talked

1061
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,990
about few other capabilities so these

1062
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:30,089
are very lightweight capabilities which

1063
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:32,399
you want to switch on and off for a

1064
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:34,589
given BF decision probably we can do

1065
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,660
that but we are not saying that you know

1066
00:59:34,589 --> 00:59:40,109
we can just use the or at least my take

1067
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,940
is that we should not use BFP for doing

1068
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,380
the loss measurement or whatever at all

1069
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:47,280
the time you're just switching on and

1070
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:49,829
off is what I think yeah again and I

1071
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,040
agree thank you we can be very

1072
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:57,359
conservative with what we put in if we

1073
00:59:53,040 --> 01:00:04,369
decide that performance monitoring is

1074
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:04,369
too much even in a poem sequence sure

1075
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:12,328
Sam Aldrin have three part question

1076
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:15,839
first one is we even know what exactly

1077
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:21,180
cannot do the proposal in a sense like

1078
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:23,310
the scope is so why now we are trying to

1079
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,109
say that it can do anything is that

1080
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:26,759
right

1081
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:28,980
no I'm not saying it can can do so

1082
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,160
anyway we should we should define what

1083
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,349
exactly can do them saying that it can

1084
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,140
do all of them so if you know what it

1085
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:40,410
cannot do then it's good so that case we

1086
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:44,359
can constrain the problem the second

1087
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:49,740
aspect is do we know who is asking this

1088
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:55,640
well as in as in motivation I I point it

1089
01:00:49,740 --> 01:01:00,000
that we had several proposals to use VFD

1090
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:03,089
for things other than continuity check

1091
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
okay so maybe I think it's alluding to

1092
01:01:03,089 --> 01:01:08,520
what Matthew asked like we need to do

1093
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,960
the due diligence of what the existing

1094
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:16,650
tools out there cannot do the the third

1095
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,330
aspect is related to this because how

1096
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:20,280
exactly it's gonna play out with the

1097
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:24,150
existing mechanisms in various working

1098
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:26,310
groups which already does some or all or

1099
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:28,320
even part of the the problems we are

1100
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:33,960
trying to solve it right but like

1101
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:36,030
Santosh mentioned so we had discussed

1102
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:40,260
and actually working group adopted this

1103
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:43,170
draft on DVD stability and it to

1104
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,690
characterize BD itself so nobody else

1105
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:48,240
does it

1106
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:50,880
what do you mean like the OEM part

1107
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,098
nobody else does it right because

1108
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:57,930
basically there is no mechanism to say

1109
01:01:53,099 --> 01:02:02,099
how many BD control packets out of n

1110
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:03,810
packets being dropped no I'm not talking

1111
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:06,420
about the mechanisms I'm talking about

1112
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:08,549
the function yes this one actually it's

1113
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,400
going to do for example the PM kind of

1114
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:15,450
thing no it's again this function

1115
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:20,190
characterizes their stability of BFD

1116
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:23,848
session okay so B if D has this detector

1117
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:27,859
multiple parameter which tells how many

1118
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:34,700
packets in a row will constitute their

1119
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:38,220
failure so if you lose one less packet

1120
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:41,368
comparing out of detect multiplier your

1121
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:44,339
session will stay but is it considered

1122
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:48,349
stable session is it a good session so

1123
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:54,119
so till now there is no mechanism to

1124
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:57,540
know that there is no BFD variable that

1125
01:02:54,119 --> 01:03:02,790
characterizes how many BFD packets you

1126
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:03,009
have lost maybe we're talking totally

1127
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:05,800
the

1128
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:08,860
things we can talk offline ya know but

1129
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:12,970
again what I'm saying is that there are

1130
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:16,180
very specific mechanism that we

1131
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:20,259
discussed and Eve D group over a period

1132
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:23,620
of time that are needed for B of D and

1133
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:27,160
the proposal is to use the extension

1134
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:30,940
mechanism to do this so basically it's

1135
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:34,200
not only for performance monitoring on

1136
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:37,330
the link that where B of D runs on a

1137
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:39,939
path that buildi runs is just a

1138
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:46,390
characterized Beauty itself at the same

1139
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:57,670
time so as we discussed earlier so the

1140
01:03:46,390 --> 01:04:01,020
authentication mode is no challenge

1141
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:01,020
Gregg in your portion of the session

1142
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:08,529
work through here that I have that she's

1143
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:11,710
in close I have no problem with that so

1144
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:14,020
a kiss from Cisco Systems so I think the

1145
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:16,990
current market direction is to simplify

1146
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,360
the control plane you even eliminate it

1147
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:21,970
using the automation and also the

1148
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:25,030
emergency recon right so the simplified

1149
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:28,450
way of forwarding packets so the two

1150
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:30,340
things so one is that in IP PM working

1151
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:32,919
group if you see the direction they have

1152
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:34,600
been taking is to simplify or even

1153
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,760
eliminate the control channel signaling

1154
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,069
at the same time if you look at the team

1155
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,080
are messages or even the staff messages

1156
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:43,060
there are messages well there isn't

1157
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,190
fixed offset so you know exactly the

1158
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,960
merton silicon will know exactly where

1159
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:50,200
to put a timestamp where to put a

1160
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,750
counter right and also the message size

1161
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,540
is very small because the memory is very

1162
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,820
small to load the payload the merton

1163
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:59,710
silicon would also know that I only need

1164
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:03,280
to load that much of it cannot write

1165
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:06,430
like byte number 2048 and look for a TLB

1166
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,980
and whatnot right so this is the market

1167
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:10,720
Direction right now and I ppm group has

1168
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,320
the expertise to go in the right

1169
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,680
direction

1170
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:16,420
so doing the VAP way we are adding a new

1171
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:19,779
control channel signaling

1172
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:21,400
as well as using a TLV with long payload

1173
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:22,930
ever better you know you don't know

1174
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,119
where to write time stamp really write a

1175
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:30,819
counter I think this is against the

1176
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:33,490
direction we're going well okay I

1177
01:05:30,819 --> 01:05:39,940
strongly disagree and we can do it on

1178
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:43,720
the list I explain why how do you Jeff

1179
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:45,519
you had as an introduction a sentence I

1180
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:49,890
don't remember exactly saying that P of

1181
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:53,259
T has a nice characteristic of being a

1182
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:55,299
simple communication channel between I

1183
01:05:53,260 --> 01:06:03,730
think that's what you said not it wasn't

1184
01:05:55,299 --> 01:06:05,230
written yeah I like that but I find also

1185
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:08,529
that scary

1186
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:12,789
in the sense that I would be very

1187
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:16,690
concerned if B of T what's being used to

1188
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:21,460
kie anything or something that doesn't

1189
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:24,069
relate from far to OEM right so I

1190
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:27,009
believe clarify my work I'm talking

1191
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:29,650
about PFD as a protocol not necessarily

1192
01:06:27,009 --> 01:06:33,880
the FDA in terms of it a given instance

1193
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:35,650
of it so remember that BFD was largely

1194
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:37,750
stolen from the hello mechanisms of

1195
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:40,180
other routing protocols no it did this

1196
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,890
is this was a very simple mechanism that

1197
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,720
we lifted from somewhere else we just

1198
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,339
happened to put an instance of it that

1199
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,439
could run really really fast really

1200
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:49,480
really simple and for the continuity

1201
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,630
check cases we've been using it for it's

1202
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:56,650
been great what I'm sort of suggesting

1203
01:06:52,630 --> 01:07:00,220
is I don't really think that we want to

1204
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:02,829
overload core continuity cases for BFP

1205
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,058
no with all this other stuff in many

1206
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:05,920
cases you know we have things like

1207
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:08,049
authentication that we've had questions

1208
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,339
about we've had features that we've

1209
01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:11,200
actually built on top of things that

1210
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:13,720
made good sense over the years and you

1211
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,359
know so if these succeeded in scaling up

1212
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:19,299
new things that you have to ask for but

1213
01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:21,339
for other mechanisms that want these no

1214
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:24,670
constant conversations between two

1215
01:07:21,339 --> 01:07:27,220
systems the packet protocol packet

1216
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:29,690
format and maybe some extra flexibility

1217
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:35,899
might provide plumbing that could be

1218
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:40,520
and different sessions understood but

1219
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:42,230
it's not necessarily om anymore it's

1220
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,369
that and that's the thing and that's one

1221
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,900
of the reasons why I think this is a

1222
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:47,180
broader conversation and thank you

1223
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,069
everyone who's not a normal PFT attendee

1224
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:53,690
he's subscribed the mailing list for

1225
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:56,930
this conversation okay yeah and it

1226
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:59,329
really the conversation I think is if we

1227
01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:01,578
think that BFD as a protocol is useful

1228
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:03,319
for cadence other stuff does some extent

1229
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:07,339
that BFD charter is know about

1230
01:08:03,319 --> 01:08:09,230
continuity that work doesn't you know

1231
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:13,400
have a lot of things happening from year

1232
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:14,960
to year if this is BFD protocol format

1233
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,210
being used for other things that's

1234
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,100
easier potentially new working group or

1235
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:21,319
a completely different charter stuff for

1236
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,400
us but it is not necessarily the core

1237
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:23,089
case of what we've been doing for

1238
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,589
continuity

1239
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:31,330
you know the last year's Geetha kitten

1240
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:34,219
does not occur Cisco so I'm completely

1241
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:37,399
in favor of we have deepen the

1242
01:08:34,219 --> 01:08:40,339
continuity check mechanism and the way

1243
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:41,358
it's been focused laser sharp on solving

1244
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:44,269
this problem

1245
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,040
so whatever other extensions like I

1246
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,670
think Santosh mentioned which can

1247
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:51,948
improve the continuity check mechanism I

1248
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:54,949
think we should you know continue doing

1249
01:08:51,948 --> 01:08:57,139
that but you know this thing about

1250
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:59,870
running another session another protocol

1251
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:03,500
another thing just to use the pole

1252
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:05,210
sequence I mean before we get down that

1253
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,000
path we should look at what other

1254
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:09,920
problems in let's say the existing

1255
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,799
mechanisms that are being discussed in

1256
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,929
AI ppm and Rakesh mentioned some of the

1257
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,689
directions that have been taken there so

1258
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:20,899
we should look at what those are and if

1259
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:23,028
there is a gap and see what how to fix

1260
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:29,089
that so we should approach it that way

1261
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:30,739
rather than the other way Thanks yoga

1262
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:33,259
through here from Bloomberg I just want

1263
01:09:30,738 --> 01:09:34,939
the other quick comment with what quick

1264
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:37,549
was saying about the there are no

1265
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:38,988
counters we'd be 80 today so we found

1266
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:42,109
with one of the major vendors because

1267
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:44,700
the PFD is implemented in hardware we

1268
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:46,170
visibility to when packets and rum so

1269
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,149
that's actually one of the things I'm

1270
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:50,760
requesting the vendors to do is they

1271
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:52,410
exposed some of those counters so that

1272
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,180
we can at least see sending received

1273
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:57,300
counters and get some statistics about

1274
01:09:54,180 --> 01:10:02,370
how we what the quality of the link is

1275
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:05,340
so just think part of the conversation

1276
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:08,400
about the extensions no I think there's

1277
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:10,710
no carry a lot of weight to it things

1278
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,120
that we are looking for I keep on

1279
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,700
running the cases where we need to carry

1280
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,170
some extra data with us no we've had the

1281
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:18,570
performance measurement nearly that

1282
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:21,950
presentation today we know that these

1283
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:24,120
things need to be fast and simple and

1284
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:26,370
again whether or not we carry the

1285
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,360
mechanism through for use for other

1286
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:31,530
working groups is a longer-term question

1287
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,210
but there's also the remaining question

1288
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:34,889
of do we carry a little bit of extra

1289
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:38,220
stuff specifically for our core use case

1290
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:40,830
so and that that might be where we draw

1291
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:42,990
our line in the sand for work within BFD

1292
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:47,190
as a working group for the continuity

1293
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:49,050
case doesn't serve that purpose and if

1294
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:51,480
so how do we keep that you know within

1295
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:53,610
the fast requirements that we've got

1296
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,679
over the years now for the other use

1297
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:58,740
cases where again we're just looking for

1298
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:00,090
a nice mechanism between two systems you

1299
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,950
know that's something to look at is you

1300
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,170
know a expand the Charter or a move to

1301
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:06,240
other working groups no mechanism that's

1302
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:08,490
one way this could potentially progress

1303
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:13,679
as an example and I'm recommending this

1304
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:15,990
a priori you know if I ppm would like

1305
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,770
they actually have a mechanism to have

1306
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:22,170
this note in her system carrier PFD is a

1307
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,670
protocols already specified you know

1308
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:26,010
what its properties are we know how it

1309
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:27,450
behaves and if we're already looking at

1310
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:30,090
what the format would look like they

1311
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:32,099
carry such things certainly we're happy

1312
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:39,240
to let them know make use of that but it

1313
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:42,120
would not be CC as we do today final

1314
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:44,610
comments yes I think yours presented as

1315
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:48,030
the RFC 66 on e4 doesn't have any

1316
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:50,190
signaling mechanism right now and this

1317
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:53,280
might be a PFD might be a way to add a

1318
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:55,449
signaling for the 62 on e4 and I think

1319
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:02,559
that that's not the right

1320
01:11:55,449 --> 01:12:03,730
I've been funny okay so this is going to

1321
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,650
continue to be I think a longer

1322
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,959
conversation again thank you for

1323
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:10,929
participating what we'd like to do is

1324
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,420
our next steps here is taking you know

1325
01:12:10,929 --> 01:12:15,580
several of these observations that we've

1326
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,929
had you know trying to distill them down

1327
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,820
a little bit and start a couple of

1328
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:21,460
threads on the mailing list probably one

1329
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:24,670
about extending VFD specifically for the

1330
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:26,860
continuity cases and then VFD as a more

1331
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:31,060
general mechanism for other working

1332
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:33,929
groups to potentially use and will carry

1333
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:36,400
it on from there the second case

1334
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:38,800
specifically is likely going to require

1335
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,120
recharging if we end up picking it up if

1336
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,130
it's a matter of helping another group

1337
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,690
lift me up the packet formats and

1338
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:44,679
procedures you know that's that's

1339
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:47,500
something that's already within our

1340
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:51,130
Charter yeah I just want to mention is

1341
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:54,250
that I haven't had discussion in a break

1342
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:56,679
time with a Monnett group their next

1343
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,020
room and unfortunately because of this

1344
01:12:56,679 --> 01:13:01,030
conflict they cannot come but they got

1345
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:04,120
interested in this discussion so let's

1346
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:05,769
include them to one thing I'm here is

1347
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:15,610
how many people in the room read the

1348
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:17,140
draft mean Rexroth take the rest of this

1349
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:20,259
the mailing list and have some good

1350
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:26,100
conversations rest IETF what about the

1351
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:26,100
devious plan no time
