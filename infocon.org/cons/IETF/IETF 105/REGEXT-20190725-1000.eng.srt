00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm sure you've seen this many times and

25
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,530
just important to keep that in mind and

26
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,229
so we'll jump right in here to our

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,909
agenda we do have a jabber scribe Thank

28
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,979
You Suzanne and we have a note scribe

29
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,920
thank you Oh Rick we've done the note

30
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,890
well and document managing this is just

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,610
our opportunity to remind people that it

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,080
is important to review documents it is

33
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,390
important to acknowledge that you have

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,400
have looked at it I realize that not

35
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,869
every document is important to everyone

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,400
so you're not going to give it a

37
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,260
detailed review and study but please do

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,060
take the time especially during last

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,260
call to read read the documents and take

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,430
a look at them and acknowledge that

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,100
you've read them and don't have any

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,709
issues with them it's very important to

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,090
be able to show some consensus here on

44
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,329
our documents and we really appreciate

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,970
that okay let's go to some of our

46
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,980
existing documents yeah

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,790
for us we've had three RFC since our

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,980
last meeting this is this is absolutely

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,810
wonderful so we have had a very

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,519
productive year this year moving some

51
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,590
things along that kind of a slow start

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,630
there for a while but we've got our

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,150
change polis al

54
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:03,609
we got the organizational mapping and

55
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,640
extension documents published so that's

56
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,060
a good thing and we have two documents

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,640
that are currently in is G evaluation we

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,900
have some comments that we just have to

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,149
resolve that don't think there's

60
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,270
anything particularly material going on

61
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,760
in these things but I know that both

62
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,200
sets of document Shepherds know that

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,940
they have work to do and they've

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,220
acknowledged to us that they're going to

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,640
move those documents forward and we're

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,140
gonna we need a new version of the feed

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,149
document I don't think the bundling

68
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,799
needs a new oh it does need a new

69
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,390
document you know the bun they need a

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,300
new document too so it'll be one more of

71
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,429
those that will then get pushed out into

72
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,200
the publication cycle so those are

73
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,970
moving along that's a good thing there

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,679
it is I remember the main thing this is

75
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,640
Barry the main thing in the fees

76
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,060
document is fleshing out the security

77
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,410
considerations dealing with money so

78
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,090
that may be a bit of a challenge to

79
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:02,410
figure out what to put in there that the

80
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:07,360
security IDs will be happy with okay and

81
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:10,870
Raju is taking notes right there's seven

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,269
changes yes Roger saying that there's

83
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,370
seven comments to be addressed in seven

84
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,269
things that he has to take care of but

85
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,930
all all doable okay quick milestone of

86
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,940
you we had kind of proposed these

87
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,729
milestones didn't really get a whole lot

88
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,410
of discussion about them but you know

89
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,180
here they are just putting them up here

90
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,830
again login security at the top is

91
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,300
actually in working group last call

92
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:40,419
which will close the week after the IETF

93
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,270
it'll close next Friday not tomorrow the

94
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,390
data escrow and the DNR D objects

95
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,490
mapping is on the agenda for today so

96
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,130
we'll get to discuss them later we're

97
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,630
also going to see the partial the are

98
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,789
gap the next three are DAP documents

99
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,740
we don't have an agenda item today for

100
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,360
the open ID stuff there's nothing to

101
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,210
progress at the moment there but it's

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,889
also a further out target for us so

103
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,560
we're just waiting for some activity

104
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,650
there okay

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,380
so now let's move into our existing work

106
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,690
and we'll jump right into a few

107
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,539
presentations here I put login security

108
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,400
up here not because anybody was going to

109
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,169
talk about it but just as an opportunity

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,500
to remind us that it isn't working group

111
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,909
last call that will close next week we

112
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,830
normally do a two-week working group

113
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,020
last call made this one three weeks

114
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,300
because we only opened it last week and

115
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,940
we didn't you know to allow an extra

116
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,440
week because this is the ITF week so

117
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,330
we're kind of just ignoring the fact

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,889
that that week is there but again not

119
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,750
expecting a whole lot of discussion not

120
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,849
expecting any issues but please as a

121
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,099
reminder please do read the document

122
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,620
please indicate that you've read it and

123
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,360
that you have no objection even if you

124
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,940
don't explicitly support it or have a

125
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,500
need for it it is useful to to know that

126
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,789
people are looking at the documents and

127
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,889
moving them along that's really very

128
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,599
important really could use some help and

129
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,599
getting more people to acknowledge that

130
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,610
they're paying attention to the work so

131
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,190
the data s crew drafts will actually be

132
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,479
up first and Gustavo's can do this but

133
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,719
Frederick Frederick you're gonna

134
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,590
Francisco not Frederick so let me get

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,590
your slides up

136
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:41,510
okay no doesn't seem to be working

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:44,390
is it on other yeah yes okay

138
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,260
hello this Francisco I'm presenting on

139
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:50,780
behalf of Gustavo who could not be here

140
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:53,090
so this is about the dura scroll drafts

141
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,780
they have been around for quite a while

142
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:00,229
so quickly what is the Rascoe is a

143
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,330
process by which some parts usually the

144
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:06,640
registries registers in the minimum

145
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,890
space store critical data necessary to

146
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,620
restore service in case of catastrophic

147
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,630
failure and they usually do this with a

148
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,290
tea party normally called that is

149
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:22,100
corrosion and there is usually some

150
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:25,160
contractile conditions that if they are

151
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:29,660
met for example an emergency failure

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,060
then the data could be released who to

153
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,910
party beneficiary for example in the

154
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,580
case of Italy's I can so that I can give

155
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:46,670
it to someone else to run the race your

156
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:48,800
the register next slide ok thanks so

157
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,800
this has been around for quite a while

158
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,170
the concept of the rostra in the little

159
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,700
space since 99 in the first contracts

160
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:00,140
with Common Era NORC and as part of the

161
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,440
natively program there there was a

162
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:07,940
thought of having a new more modern that

163
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,070
also format to use that was define and

164
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,810
has been in use since the launch of the

165
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:17,480
natal business slide and there was in in

166
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:22,540
the side of the IDF there was above by

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:24,350
in back in 2000 I won't say I don't

168
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,320
whenever idea

169
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,320
77 was and and unfortunately the worker

170
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:34,970
was not formed but a memories was

171
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:43,120
started and work on the draft was carry

172
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:43,120
true in that many lease an order for

173
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,439
the specification had been stable now

174
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,480
for a couple years or more and only

175
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,450
minimal updates have been done basically

176
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:59,080
maintenance or minimal issues that have

177
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:02,540
been detected and next slide and the

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,730
drafts I think this is just a quick

179
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,709
history they it was originally one draft

180
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:14,170
he was fit into two then there was the

181
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:17,150
proposal by Jing qu here and others to

182
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,099
extend the format to not only be XML

183
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:23,449
because the original proposal was only

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,240
XML as so the proposal so Jim and others

185
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:31,600
proposed to make it be basically a dual

186
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:38,480
format so it's XML alone or XML plus CSV

187
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:41,060
to escrow the objects next slide and the

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,090
primary target is domain names however

189
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:49,329
it can be extended to other registries

190
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,330
or other older type of registries and

191
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,740
the format also supports supports

192
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,140
different types of deposits it can be

193
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,730
the full deposit meaning the whole set

194
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,580
of data or it can be something

195
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,370
incremental or differential just adding

196
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,780
or deleting objects as they have been

197
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:18,080
changed or removed or added next slide

198
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:20,660
and so the the first draft the radix

199
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,150
that Icecrown that's sort of the

200
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,400
container definition of the container

201
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,740
for that I'll scroll and finds for

202
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,810
example the type of the process you are

203
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,300
making a pool incremental or financial

204
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,829
the ID etcetera and a couple other

205
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:39,079
things net slide defines also

206
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,640
importantly the the watermark what is

207
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,770
called the where mark that is the day

208
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,830
and time corresponding to when the

209
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:49,939
deposit or when the data from the

210
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,700
registry or the database has been pull

211
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,529
so for example if the data escrow

212
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,119
deposit is corresponding to today we

213
00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:02,659
the time some of today the format is

214
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:04,849
also extensible so you can define you

215
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:07,009
can identify the extensions that are

216
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:12,009
being used the objects are being a screw

217
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:16,819
there next slide the objects mapping is

218
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:18,379
is what you defined the work what are

219
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:21,199
the definition for all the objects that

220
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:24,459
can be escrow is is define as I said

221
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:29,478
before it's supposed to format xml or

222
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:32,468
CSB next slide this is the list of

223
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:38,869
objects are defining the in the document

224
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:39,499
this list has not changed for four years

225
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,559
now

226
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:45,949
you will find what the typical type of

227
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:51,368
objects you find in a registry the Menem

228
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:55,008
ratio register next slide

229
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:57,369
who uses the other Astra format as I

230
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,669
said most of the deities are using this

231
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:01,459
excuse me

232
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:05,889
since the launch of the new Tilda round

233
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:09,618
in 2013 this has been in use and

234
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:13,309
nowadays even some legacy utilities have

235
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:17,959
moved to this new format excuse me so

236
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:19,339
it's been used for the data escrow

237
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,858
obligations are contained in the

238
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,569
contract but also is we understand has

239
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:26,239
been used by races when they are

240
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,429
transitioning so it for example register

241
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,239
is changing from race the service

242
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:35,358
provider and they typically use this the

243
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:39,349
rest grow format to transmit data from

244
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:41,449
one hour speed to another it is also

245
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:44,359
being used by the corresponding their

246
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:46,969
escrow agents I believe we have nine in

247
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:50,029
a little space and all of them currently

248
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,799
supported format they have to do some

249
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:55,009
validations per contract they have with

250
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,139
icon and I have to confess within check

251
00:12:55,009 --> 00:13:01,309
if this is being used in other contexts

252
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:03,319
for example Z tilde space it is also

253
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:05,358
being used as in the Italy space by the

254
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,469
emergency button range operators this is

255
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:10,260
a service we have

256
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,530
United contract we have three providers

257
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,980
are really available to take over TL

258
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:20,520
leave there were some emergency and we

259
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:25,080
totally had to use this year or two ago

260
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,880
with one detail it had a failure one of

261
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,070
the critical functions that are

262
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,010
described in the contract so that that

263
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,950
really was successfully taken but why

264
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,930
buy one of the Ebro providers and we

265
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:42,480
used the Rosco format to rebuild the LD

266
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,339
it is it has another use also in the

267
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,370
icon contract the utilities have to

268
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,860
provide access in both to registration

269
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,590
data to icon on a periodic basis and we

270
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:59,190
use that format that Alaska format for

271
00:13:52,590 --> 00:14:01,860
the racist provided to us next slide so

272
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,930
we we think these straps are quite

273
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:09,440
mature they have been around for several

274
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:11,489
years and so we know this has been just

275
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,160
adopted by the working group recently

276
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,890
however likes that we we think they are

277
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:23,430
ready they have been used they are being

278
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:25,590
used by several parties so we are asking

279
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,260
whether if you guys agree that it would

280
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,900
be wise to now go directly to working

281
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:35,520
low classical and and there are the two

282
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:37,500
drops that's it thank you any questions

283
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,370
or comments about these drafts from

284
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,300
anyone

285
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,520
I see Antwon getting in a cubicle head

286
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,329
down here first forward please like this

287
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,840
is a wish from the foundation I would

288
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:54,420
like just the you said that the the

289
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:59,720
escrow format is extensible so are the

290
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:03,660
objects extensible to and I believe some

291
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,370
we have seen use extensions to the

292
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:11,810
contact objects yes okay let me go

293
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,810
online to Antoine

294
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,030
okay let me get one - phone line - the

295
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,590
sound something is a bit shaky but I

296
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,689
don't know one question actually and it

297
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,030
is can you explain to me what the

298
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:33,330
intended status of the documents why

299
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:35,370
these standards I'm sorry I could not I

300
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:39,000
think it's question is why is the

301
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:49,080
document standards track why is the

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:50,940
intended status standards track so what

303
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,580
was the last instead of informational or

304
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,440
best current practice I don't think we

305
00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:01,050
have a strong opinion but genes is your

306
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,480
quarter I don't know you want to say

307
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,729
something about it yeah she go from

308
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,860
Verisign um yeah we've actually gone

309
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,980
through that site or the length of these

310
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,990
drafts it livings in existence but in

311
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,690
essence is in front a standard file

312
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,900
format that's used for s pros

313
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:21,710
it's not a operational practice it's

314
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,030
actually a file format and it's used by

315
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,550
many many different parties in the

316
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,500
registry industry so I'm not sure would

317
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,990
be a good fit for informational I really

318
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,150
see it as a standards track based on its

319
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:38,190
usage and the fact that it's defining

320
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:40,650
standard file format and I guess for me

321
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,320
what I would add to that is just that it

322
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,939
is a in essence it's a communication

323
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,270
mechanism it's a protocol for

324
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,430
communication between parties so file

325
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,870
format is what it is because you're

326
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,420
transferring a whole file but it is

327
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,670
really a communication method and the

328
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,130
syntax and semantics for all of that so

329
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,219
I think standards track is is the right

330
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,270
thing for it did you so let me just go

331
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,069
back to Antoine did you have a

332
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,250
preference that it not be standard to

333
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,679
track well I was I was asking the

334
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,380
question because I don't know if this is

335
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,420
going to if this is a completely new

336
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,880
protocol or that it is defining

337
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,220
something else and it is defining a file

338
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,200
format and that that's what I understood

339
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,600
but it's also defining a forest fire

340
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,110
forward between a limited number of

341
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,109
parties

342
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,660
so hence my question papers okay thanks

343
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,809
and the rest will probably they have a

344
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,820
discussion on the list Thanks

345
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,039
like to keep just general the very same

346
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,539
again um actually I was thinking that it

347
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,299
might be a good idea for us to add an

348
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,200
implementation status section

349
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,910
considering the fact that we have so

350
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,210
many mutation with us that we go ahead

351
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,910
and update the drafts to see that yeah

352
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:56,080
that's a good suggestion thanks for that

353
00:17:50,910 --> 00:18:00,370
Rick two questions one since there's

354
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,980
going to be PII you transited in the

355
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,719
escrow on in a lot of cases is there

356
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,580
some sort of privacy considerations that

357
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,070
we need to put in on that good because I

358
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,399
don't because that that is you know from

359
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:18,220
the data that gets collected in certain

360
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,850
cases is going to have contact data and

361
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:24,840
so obviously it needs to technically get

362
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:28,570
escrow for the written order for the

363
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,459
escrow to fulfill its function but it is

364
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,129
gonna be having that data in there so

365
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,990
it's just something that is like worth

366
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,440
considering and then and in the last

367
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,789
second late and lastly who's that it's

368
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,940
it's good that we're standardizing

369
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:46,000
format again sir certainly support about

370
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:51,100
that but the given what's going on in

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,330
the land of gTLDs the expedited policy

372
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,350
development process related at

373
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,299
registration data the the data that is

374
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:02,490
collected by registrar's and registries

375
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:05,710
is likely to be morphing and changing

376
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:08,980
over the next period of time relatively

377
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,950
soon and so it's unclear to me at

378
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,140
present what sort of flexibility is

379
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,850
already built into the standard to

380
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,970
accommodate this or are we going to need

381
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:22,299
to rev this document in order to

382
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,980
accommodate some possible future changes

383
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:27,340
to the escrow format that might be

384
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:32,520
driven by the changing registration data

385
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:37,899
requirements right so the data scroll

386
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:40,840
specification was defined with have any

387
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:45,220
minds for multiple set of contract

388
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,330
our policy requirements so the the way

389
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,850
was the finest makes almost everything

390
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:55,389
optional and it's up to some other means

391
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,070
contract policy whatever to make the

392
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,860
list of things that need to be included

393
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,500
and so in that sense I think we're safe

394
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:06,250
but it would be great to hear what you

395
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,559
think or others thing about that okay

396
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,210
okay maybe we can look at that and make

397
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,730
sure that that language is explicit

398
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,620
enough that we said that clearly finds

399
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,510
that this is that kind of mechanism and

400
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:21,639
doesn't really prescribe what is

401
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:25,658
required so good thank you no

402
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:32,140
I think this has been the only deployed

403
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:36,100
but use stable before I would urge us

404
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,649
that you should push this over RFC so we

405
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,879
have an RFC and proposed standard I

406
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:44,799
think it's the right thing

407
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,240
Thanks thanks mom I'm not seeing anyone

408
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,549
else in the queue there I will add

409
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,590
myself speaking for my self you know and

410
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,299
we are at an implementer of this as as

411
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,340
other folks are in the room here I've

412
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:00,750
been doing this for a long time

413
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,029
it is interesting the question that

414
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,029
about the future of this document in

415
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:08,919
format given what is going on and I can

416
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:10,840
or what it's gonna do I don't know how

417
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,980
to respond to that right now but we

418
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,720
should take the discussion to the

419
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,120
mailing list part of what's going on

420
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,159
here in my mind is some these things

421
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,840
have been broadly used broadly deployed

422
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,730
for you know almost a decade now I think

423
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,129
the documents are pretty well baked and

424
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,649
it is important and useful to to get

425
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,830
that document publication closed that

426
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:35,080
cycle let's have a discussion on the

427
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,470
list as to how far we want to want to

428
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,629
take revisions to this document it may

429
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,880
be that it's we should iterate on the

430
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,490
document and iterate on a published

431
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,039
document instead of iterating on this

432
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,360
specification at this point in time is a

433
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,390
better thing just because of the broad

434
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,678
deployment while we wait for other

435
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,540
things to happen so that would be my

436
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,980
personal comment

437
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,490
all of it I'm generally supportive of

438
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,230
moving these things forward chin yes you

439
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,720
go from Verisign I'm thinking about the

440
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,250
future of the document and the potential

441
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,870
for changes you may want to consider

442
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,510
relaxing some of the requirements in

443
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,820
there if it becomes an RFC and that's

444
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:19,020
something which is required becomes

445
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,600
optional based on later changes in

446
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,150
policy we wanted you know have to kid

447
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,510
you are so yeah so something to think

448
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,640
about

449
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:32,040
yeah so thank you Francisco just a quick

450
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,630
comment then is as chair about this

451
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,250
document again it's on our milestone

452
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,980
list the intent was that there probably

453
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,660
wouldn't be too much discussion of this

454
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,120
document although it was important to

455
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,220
bring it back to the surface put it up

456
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,409
in front of people you know yes take the

457
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,200
time to give it a review and make sure

458
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,990
you know that there are no issues with

459
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,760
it but ideally to progress this along

460
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,170
pretty quickly but we will take the

461
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,730
concrete question to the mailing list

462
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,230
about whether or not to drop this into

463
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,690
working group last call and move this

464
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,130
along let's see if any showstopper

465
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:13,410
objections come up on the mailing list

466
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:16,380
and get everyone involved okay next up

467
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,600
on our agenda is the our DAP documents

468
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,580
so Mario yep a preference in what order

469
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,159
Mario or can I just bring them up in

470
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,550
this order or you'll have all three of

471
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,660
these right you have a preference on the

472
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,919
order of these three okay I'll just

473
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,520
bring them up in whatever order they're

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:39,930
here okay so here we go

475
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:42,990
partial response first hello everybody

476
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:45,810
on Monday afraid the phone dr. T

477
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:52,200
registry this will work for you yeah

478
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:55,760
okay we could do that these are very

479
00:23:52,200 --> 00:24:02,510
short presentation about the progress of

480
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:06,670
each of the three drafts is only four

481
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:11,610
summarize the most meaningful changes

482
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:15,520
since the last meeting and to collect

483
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:22,090
possible feedbacks from the attendees

484
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:28,629
and the first one draft is passer

485
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:33,220
response then the question zero one the

486
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:36,490
Russians you know one the basic field

487
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:39,040
sets has been changed from required to

488
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,420
optional so their implementation now is

489
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:48,540
considered helpful but not required to

490
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,540
improve adapt interoperability the

491
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,160
definition of fields included in the

492
00:24:53,230 --> 00:25:03,430
field setters be removed because there

493
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:09,930
was a clear feedback from the working

494
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:12,400
group to avoid a clear definition of the

495
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:17,770
fields including in the brief it says

496
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:21,940
and to let the other providers to to

497
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:24,870
implement the brief etcetera as it see

498
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,770
as they see fit

499
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:32,919
so now another pod is free to define the

500
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:40,090
content of the briefing set in the

501
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:46,360
version zero to zero to the negative

502
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:47,939
answer session has been added so now it

503
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,320
is clear that the request including

504
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:55,440
including a non-supportive visa to

505
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:58,510
obtain a bad request response code and

506
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:03,370
the IANA consideration section has been

507
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:07,410
added to ask Yana for the registration

508
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,409
of such setting extension

509
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:22,340
yesterday Tamera zone I can see I can

510
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:28,690
see here provides some feedbacks about

511
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:35,870
each of the three draft I I provided my

512
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:39,920
my comments in turn this this feedback

513
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:45,639
is not included in this presentation due

514
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:49,640
to the lack of time but I hope that

515
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:54,980
everyone every working group member

516
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:59,920
could give his own contribution to the

517
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,920
discussion of do all these new feedbacks

518
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,340
apart these apart the feedbacks provided

519
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:14,390
by Tamera zone I think that there are no

520
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:21,189
other issues so I the other consider

521
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:29,210
this this document pretty ready for the

522
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:34,760
working group last call I can pass to

523
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:36,500
the other ok the second draft um how do

524
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,970
folks who want to do this do you do want

525
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,470
to take them as a block and make it

526
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,970
we'll just quickly go through the couple

527
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,390
of slides for each one and then we'll

528
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,890
take us a lot to talk about them seeing

529
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:50,630
a couple of nodding heads on that so

530
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:55,850
let's um do it that way I prefer to talk

531
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:58,510
about the rest such as the last 30 pin

532
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,510
paging okay

533
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:11,570
the change is shown in this regard about

534
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:17,990
the sorting of pages draft in the

535
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:21,590
version 0 1 the page a metadata object

536
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:26,870
has been simplified and now it contains

537
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:29,570
only a free free members total count

538
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:35,449
page count and links in the Russian

539
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:37,580
server to the duality between offsetting

540
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,820
cuts imagination has been fixed

541
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,550
now the cursor for parameter can encrypt

542
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:52,490
above offset and cut some pagination

543
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:58,850
information these are shown him in the

544
00:28:52,490 --> 00:29:02,930
slide simply encryption based on a

545
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:09,679
base64 encoding but obviously they are

546
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:12,770
not they are not considered the real so

547
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:19,370
the both offset and limit 1 are meters

548
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:25,040
have being removed and also in this in

549
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:27,820
this version the Yana consideration

550
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,620
section has been added to ask a Yana for

551
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,429
for the registration on sorting and

552
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:40,219
paging extension in where some versions

553
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:43,490
are 3 the CC sorting property has been

554
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:53,140
added to the list of the sorting

555
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:53,140
property due to the publication of RFC 8

556
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,340
8605

557
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:07,610
in addition to the issues provided by

558
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:11,990
tamara zone some issues the author

559
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:13,280
consider Mina minor for example should

560
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,860
the value or jacquard

561
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:21,230
sortez parameter be considered when

562
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:25,490
sorting we think that the the answer is

563
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:29,450
no because this parameter is related

564
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:34,640
only to the N and the org

565
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:40,280
bukata elements and it makes sense only

566
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:42,830
in a collection of of jacquard of

567
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:46,010
jacquards this is not the case because

568
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:49,720
we are in the case of a collection or

569
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,090
objects including jacquard

570
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,530
could a possible jacquard the

571
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:58,870
replacement effect the sorting

572
00:30:54,530 --> 00:31:05,620
capability this is a possibility that

573
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:09,860
will not affect affect the draft because

574
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:15,280
the they are the implementer would

575
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:18,350
simply need to change the Jews apartment

576
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,990
member in sorting method sorting

577
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,379
metadata so he can change the

578
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,299
[Music]

579
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:32,380
representation of the contact

580
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:37,418
information and simply changing the the

581
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:43,700
department member in soft metal metadata

582
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:47,850
212 to maintain the correspondence

583
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,179
between the sorting properties and the

584
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:56,770
[Music]

585
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:56,770
the jacquard element okay

586
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:15,480
one is a better search draft as a

587
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,400
consequence to the discussion inside the

588
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,300
working group we in the working group

589
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,450
about the privacy consideration I have

590
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:31,280
changed the privacy considerations

591
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:39,330
section to make clear to make clear that

592
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:44,490
this capability must be provided only on

593
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:49,280
the strict control and only to users who

594
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:52,140
are legitimated by illegal legal basis

595
00:32:49,280 --> 00:33:00,500
in the previous consideration section

596
00:32:52,140 --> 00:33:06,540
some of these potential users are

597
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,750
supposed are reported I think that

598
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:13,740
probably there are other potential uses

599
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:16,970
that can take advantage from this

600
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:22,640
capability and are legitimated by some

601
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:28,980
legal basis these are just to refresh

602
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:34,670
the current path available for for this

603
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:41,940
capability and I think that there are

604
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:46,020
two open issues - - to tackle one if for

605
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:48,240
example we should should we add a pod

606
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,090
segment to enable the research on a

607
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,050
custom property just to make this

608
00:33:51,090 --> 00:34:04,850
capability more extensible for example

609
00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:04,850
at OTT we have a property about a

610
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:13,049
registrant that that is the personal the

611
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:17,550
tax identification number

612
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:20,100
and this is a custom property it is used

613
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:26,850
only in the context of the daughter GE

614
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:30,330
registry so my opinion is that this is

615
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:38,639
an example of a custom property and

616
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:45,029
which we should provide a Marais to

617
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:52,679
stand the the possible property subject

618
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:57,360
to reverse search a consequence to the

619
00:34:52,679 --> 00:35:02,610
introduction of this new search segment

620
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:05,730
path but segment is if we should opt for

621
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:08,520
a unique path allowing the research on

622
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:12,810
an entity detail on any entity details

623
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:18,119
so for example the previous entity

624
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:25,730
rental or entity F and search path

625
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:31,580
segment could be translating into new

626
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:34,010
search with the same sharing the same

627
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:42,080
[Music]

628
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:46,920
research pod segment another problem is

629
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:50,819
if we should avoid the value member to

630
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:54,500
have different types this is the the

631
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:58,350
case when we press from the

632
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,750
representation of an address and the

633
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:05,609
representation of any other value

634
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:11,310
connected to the other the other reverse

635
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:15,540
search properties so the solution coming

636
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:19,440
to to my mind splitting the value member

637
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:22,259
in s value and value to represent an

638
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,040
string value or and an object value just

639
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:32,460
to not too

640
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:35,620
blige the other prominent implementer to

641
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:39,540
customize the reason decidedly

642
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,540
deserialization methods

643
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:47,430
another possibility is defined by the

644
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:51,310
member type always as a string and live

645
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:59,730
and join and Medicaid's to a future

646
00:36:51,310 --> 00:37:04,830
capability so for example the the last

647
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:10,480
example of a query reverse search query

648
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:17,110
could be transformed into reverse search

649
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:24,240
where we join in in and by by not by a

650
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:30,810
future adapt capability addressing the

651
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:35,439
complex disobey or queries with

652
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:37,980
predicates join it by endo or or or so

653
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,980
on and so on

654
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:52,840
ok ok just to put these documents in

655
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,540
contact so the mic is open now for any

656
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,070
questions or comments you know concerns

657
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,420
with these things and as we get ready

658
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,660
for that

659
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,460
these all three of these documents are

660
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,960
new features and enhancements are adapt

661
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,270
stuff that wasn't there before

662
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,920
so it's important to take a look at them

663
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:10,900
and consider if you know this is really

664
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,250
the best way to do them from the point

665
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,020
of view of this working group we had

666
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,420
targeted having all three of these

667
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:19,690
things done and published pushed out the

668
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,880
door by the next IETF in November so

669
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,980
it's important to keep that in mind you

670
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,690
know there we need to have whatever

671
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,700
discussion we need to have about moving

672
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,290
these forward and I'll observe that

673
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,910
currently it looks like the first two

674
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,810
the sorting and searching and partial

675
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:36,040
response do seem to be relatively stable

676
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,350
the reverse search document

677
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,069
seems to have just some open questions

678
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,049
and issues here

679
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:44,869
so if there is no further discussion

680
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:47,150
that happens on the partial response and

681
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:50,599
sorting and searching they're likely to

682
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:53,239
go to last call sometime relatively soon

683
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,680
we'll we'll push through the data escrow

684
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,150
things first and then we'll be coming

685
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,118
around to these documents and look to

686
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,190
move them along so you know please do

687
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,069
take the opportunity if you haven't been

688
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:06,049
thus far to give these documents a read

689
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:07,369
and a review and you do consideration to

690
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:10,219
whether they're ready to move forward or

691
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:15,109
not and with that the my clients are

692
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:18,199
open so please great thanks thanks Maria

693
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:21,140
for doing these and some good updates in

694
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:23,749
this recent round my thoughts and

695
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:26,359
concerns around these are more macro not

696
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:28,069
related to the particulars of either

697
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:31,549
searching sorting partial response or

698
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:35,930
research but more that from an industry

699
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:38,119
standpoint are standing largely in stark

700
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,489
contrast to the thing that Francisco

701
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:44,299
just presented which has been in

702
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:48,099
production for eons the target

703
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:53,059
production date for I can contracted

704
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:57,890
gTLDs for our DAP is August 26 as many

705
00:39:53,059 --> 00:40:01,099
processes no and so our gap is ramping

706
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:05,440
is heading towards production and no one

707
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:08,209
has really any skin not knowing

708
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,269
operational experience at scale is very

709
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:13,519
limited across the industry and I would

710
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:15,109
offer that the industry in itself is

711
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,589
going to be going through a rapid

712
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:21,440
learning curve just on basic our GAAP

713
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:24,469
operations both from the server side and

714
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:28,609
from people building clients against

715
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:30,680
that and so while these features that

716
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:32,959
we're talking about are you know

717
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,118
generally interesting and certainly

718
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:37,069
applicable and I think are going to

719
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,199
happen might be concerned about the

720
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:40,819
entirety of them is that implementations

721
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,049
are going to be evolving very very

722
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:47,808
rapidly and we may be inadvertently

723
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:49,969
memorializing into an RFC something that

724
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:52,180
with some implementation experience is

725
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:54,910
going to be subject to revision

726
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,509
you know son thanks right and then I

727
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:01,210
think the thing on reverse search is a

728
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:04,420
slightly different one because they're

729
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:08,230
even the policy on that in the gTLD

730
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:11,050
space is is yet to even be really

731
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,450
started on the reverse search and so I

732
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,460
think that standardizing and that one in

733
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,890
particular would be very premature and

734
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,960
the other two you know I think we're

735
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:24,160
probably safe from a policy standpoint

736
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,530
but the technology in our community

737
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,259
learnings on this are going to be moving

738
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:31,900
rapidly and in 24 months we'll be

739
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:35,110
standing in you know we'll be having a

740
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,570
regex meeting wherever it is in 2020 100

741
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,520
said wow it I can't believe it's been

742
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:41,470
two years looking how this is grown so

743
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,160
generalist is worried about the concept

744
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:46,450
I just think it's a little early to be

745
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:55,830
cooking and serving this dish

746
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:59,950
when yes I'm aware that I think that

747
00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:04,150
there is a distinction between the three

748
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:08,169
documents if reverse search and parts

749
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:12,430
partial response address a problem that

750
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:16,000
is common to every rest service

751
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:23,430
providing data so I'm quite confident

752
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:27,750
that this solution we will not be

753
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:32,109
encounter any issues in the future any

754
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:39,970
particular issues in the future if if we

755
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:48,010
now release this document as as RFC in

756
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:50,589
the in the short term different I have a

757
00:42:48,010 --> 00:43:00,820
different opinion about the research I

758
00:42:50,590 --> 00:43:03,510
know that this is it is specific it is

759
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,510
specific

760
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:12,500
solution for a specific problem of in

761
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:17,450
the domain context so I am no rush

762
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:22,580
I am I I can't wait for possible

763
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:29,990
feedback possible feedbacks coming from

764
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:34,520
the working group members I I thank you

765
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:41,390
thank thank Tom for his contribution to

766
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:45,250
the to moving forward this dog to moving

767
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:49,490
forward these documents but I hope that

768
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:53,870
there will be other feedbacks coming

769
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:56,359
from the working group members so the

770
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:59,660
first to do the first two documents

771
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:06,470
seems to me more stable than the

772
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:11,509
research so this this is why I'm

773
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:18,640
thinking to to ask for to postpone them

774
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:25,880
the milestone of the research to have a

775
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:29,390
more comprehensive document I have no

776
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,430
problem in this sense so let me ask a

777
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,740
clarifying question by May erectus to

778
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,879
make sure that I heard you correctly so

779
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,799
I think you made an excellent case for

780
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,740
actually pushing out the current

781
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,230
milestones for these documents to give

782
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,100
ourselves a chance to get some real

783
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,170
implementation experience with them

784
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,150
because you are asking a very valid

785
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,400
question about has anyone implemented

786
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,750
these that you've interrupted with all

787
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,420
three of these do you've done the

788
00:44:53,750 --> 00:45:01,610
implementations has anyone else maybe

789
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:08,900
Thomas made and I made another

790
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:11,270
permutation of of the Nutri graphs there

791
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:17,780
are implementation about

792
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:20,720
paging from Google and no other

793
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,150
implementation okay hi

794
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,500
which I know I can so that's an

795
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,940
important question it did I hear you

796
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,070
correctly Rick I mean I guess basically

797
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,560
that's what you were pointing out that's

798
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:32,450
that's fair I don't think there's a

799
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,250
particular I think that these would

800
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,830
benefit from some implementation

801
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:40,610
experience across the board and the

802
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:42,290
community and as well as the other thing

803
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,180
that we're that the community I think is

804
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:47,060
going to be soon and we're seeing that

805
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,100
soon encountering is implementation

806
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,369
experience yes possible changes required

807
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:54,290
for vanilla are gap right yes some of

808
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:59,210
the discussion later ending up in the

809
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:01,900
Jay s contact that's an example a day

810
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:05,920
working group to decide the priority are

811
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:12,619
these documents I am no no problem to i

812
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:17,119
my my wish is to have at the end the

813
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:19,490
most comprehensive document so okay

814
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,190
so let's continue moving down to so

815
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,200
thanks Rick and we'll make sure to take

816
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,150
that certainly the chairs take notice

817
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,859
that delaying the milestone might be

818
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,180
appropriate here and we'll bring that to

819
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:36,590
the mailing list to and get some other

820
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:38,660
input I think your point here remember

821
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:41,330
not having different types is a good one

822
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,940
I think it should be a string in all

823
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:46,910
cases like you said it just will make

824
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:50,330
things easier for implementers more

825
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:52,399
generally on the responses that this I

826
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,200
think one of the issues that effects

827
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,880
both reverse search and sorting and

828
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:00,379
purging is the CC and country name issue

829
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,800
you might have one server that publishes

830
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:08,480
country one so the publishes CC one does

831
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:10,609
both different parameters etc a half on

832
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,369
the weather just getting rid of country

833
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:19,400
from sorting and just going to CC in

834
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:22,700
both cases and saying service can yes ie

835
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,360
I provided the air a sponsor to your

836
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:28,410
questions by email

837
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,990
my opinion is that the the situation is

838
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:34,350
different for sorting for sorting and

839
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:41,359
paging and for research in certain

840
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:49,350
managing the under implement decide to

841
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:54,540
to provide CC as a sorting property

842
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:59,730
because CC is the element that the other

843
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:05,000
server returned returns so in the case

844
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:10,110
of reverse search you are searching for

845
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:19,200
something connected to the country so if

846
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:26,840
you if you for example if you declare cc

847
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:30,029
equal Italy I my other server can

848
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:36,150
transform this information as something

849
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:39,630
to to match in the my in the country

850
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:44,520
information oh yeah so if I have country

851
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:47,370
name I I will search for Italy if I am

852
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:51,990
the country code I will search for da TT

853
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:56,190
because it is a search so I don't want

854
00:48:51,990 --> 00:49:02,879
to as I told you by my as I don't want

855
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:08,490
to define an S and explicit mapping I

856
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:14,310
want to to define a semantic equivalence

857
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:18,600
between the concept or between the

858
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:23,759
country code that it is reporting in in

859
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:31,180
in the query and the information I have

860
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:34,750
on the underline DBMS so I think

861
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:37,450
the implementers should be free to map

862
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:41,830
this information on his information if

863
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:43,839
he if he if the country name is

864
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:47,170
available instead of country code they

865
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:50,740
will map the country the the information

866
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:56,260
the Queen so the country code i-i-i-t to

867
00:49:50,740 --> 00:50:00,040
the country name Italy okay just to not

868
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:04,750
lose to to to not lose a relevant

869
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:08,290
information and to provide as many

870
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:15,700
results as possible which are relevant

871
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:19,390
okay this is my opinion we can due to

872
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:22,240
the fact that there are that the

873
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:29,980
information is represented in different

874
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:33,879
ways and there is in my opinion it is

875
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:40,810
much more difficult to define explicit

876
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:44,680
mapping it's better to to say when you

877
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:50,350
are searching for CC dot 80 you can

878
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:56,500
search for CC dot 80 country name Italy

879
00:50:50,350 --> 00:51:00,940
you can search Italy instead in inner

880
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:05,710
structure address for example so you can

881
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:08,320
provide all the relevant you can your

882
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:13,090
server can return all the all the

883
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:17,980
relevant information to the users the

884
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:21,280
different different perspective is for

885
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:26,440
for the sorting capability because you

886
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:29,200
expect that the CC dot ID will will

887
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:34,030
appear in your response because you are

888
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:37,629
sorting for that information so in that

889
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:43,220
case they see see for example the CC

890
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:46,490
parameters must must appear but you as

891
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:49,399
and our DUP implemented decide if CC is

892
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:51,649
the sorting properties or country name

893
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:56,329
is the sorting properties or something

894
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:58,280
else is a sorting profit so thank you

895
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,190
mariya one thing I want to be careful of

896
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,380
a little conscious of time here we don't

897
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,910
need to solve everything here but since

898
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,859
that was a question was on the mailing

899
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:10,730
list we can just refer to taking the

900
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:15,950
discussion there too so trying to have

901
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:18,829
shorter responses but please go ahead we

902
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,720
got in there we go so developed I don't

903
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:23,390
think that it should be as a working

904
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,069
group tied to like an policies because

905
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:31,040
aldub is also used by a CCT ID by VG's

906
00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:34,099
twist so so it's not a problem for me if

907
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,430
we move forward but but there is of

908
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:39,140
course a big problem with piracy issues

909
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:41,839
because of the power we must search you

910
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:44,868
can find a lot of things as you didn't

911
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,940
know the fact that you can get

912
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:49,339
information about the domain coca-cola

913
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:52,250
dot-com does not mean you have a right

914
00:52:49,339 --> 00:52:54,290
to know all the domains registered by

915
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,790
the coca-cola company and it's even

916
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:00,079
worse for individual users of course so

917
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:03,230
this has been discussed already in

918
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,869
Dragon as final but I don't see any

919
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:08,390
progress on that the current privacy

920
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:10,609
considerations could be exactly the same

921
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:14,629
for the ordinary held up there is

922
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:17,270
nothing new in it just saying that it

923
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:20,150
should be done you know foodway which is

924
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:25,910
quite obvious all of us share we do only

925
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:28,790
a lawful thing so really this before

926
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,920
there is someone killed warning the

927
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:33,800
privacy consideration that we the search

928
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:38,890
is much more powerful than ordinary

929
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,890
search on these special protections you

930
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:50,649
know that my opinion is not it's not the

931
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:54,790
same as your because I think that add up

932
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,790
as they

933
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:09,810
the measures to to implement to enforce

934
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:13,610
the security to to allow this capability

935
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:17,660
only to legitimated users there are

936
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:23,310
examples available on the web but of

937
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:30,450
bulk reverse with capability available

938
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:39,570
for for money so we are talking about

939
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:43,049
something that has been overcome in from

940
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:46,380
the technology from by the technology in

941
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:50,730
the reality there are some services

942
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:53,430
available on the Internet you can do the

943
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:57,780
reverse series and probably in the

944
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:59,879
future you you you will you you are you

945
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:09,410
will have the possibility to reverse a

946
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:14,970
tap for money and these services are

947
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:21,089
open to everyone so I think that is

948
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:26,129
better to have a capability to provide

949
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:30,900
the research only to authenticated users

950
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:37,350
then to provide adapter the research to

951
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:41,810
everyone in the future good guy should

952
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:46,319
have no problem doing people so this is

953
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:48,630
I think but it sinks a thing I don't

954
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,400
know a very good question though and and

955
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:51,630
a good point which really we do need

956
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,090
more discussion on the mailing list

957
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,930
there is a distinction between you know

958
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:00,390
privacy policies and the effect on what

959
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:01,740
the protocol does so having a protocol

960
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,420
which defines the right way to do things

961
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,209
and then in the privacy considerations

962
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,620
we just need to call out that you know

963
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,880
there are policies that are going to

964
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,259
affect us but

965
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,130
we should have more discussion about

966
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,990
this on the list and what we need to put

967
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:19,350
in these privacy consideration sections

968
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:22,049
for this these droughts I agree with you

969
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:26,930
that it's about the issue of policies

970
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:30,180
not what we should do is to clearly what

971
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:32,430
we do sir to create very different

972
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,310
problems from ordinary access and

973
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:37,319
require special policies speaking

974
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,450
personally I tend to agree with you and

975
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,280
but what I think is important and why

976
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,950
I'm stressing more discussion on the

977
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,990
mailing list is we do need other voices

978
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,850
in this other people need to speak about

979
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:51,180
what the right way is to characterize

980
00:56:47,850 --> 00:57:00,089
this so and then we should have that

981
00:56:51,180 --> 00:57:10,200
discussion that's funny I agree we need

982
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:11,970
a bit of privacy story around the I

983
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,720
can't should not be the gating factor

984
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:19,770
for for this first off the I can it's

985
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,750
not one of one mind about anything the

986
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,950
TS she actually pointed out the reverse

987
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:25,470
search draft is something that it's

988
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:28,290
needed so that's part of ICANN that was

989
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:31,200
an I can group just because the policy

990
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:34,350
people and their expedited status aren't

991
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,750
really doing anything you know we can't

992
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:39,150
sit around and wait on them also our tap

993
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:43,410
is used by cctlds it's used by the RIR

994
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:44,640
so it's not just a dick deity thing but

995
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:48,810
I do think we need a better privacy

996
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,670
story I also do owe it to to Mario to

997
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:54,090
review all the drafts s comments early

998
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:56,610
on but I need to do that again okay just

999
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:58,740
a clarifying question then so Rick was

1000
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:00,810
was kind of making the case earlier -

1001
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,299
you know delay publication but I hear

1002
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:05,460
you pointing out that Rick's argument

1003
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,290
was was based in part on deployment at

1004
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,090
scale and what's going on in the gTLD

1005
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,320
space but you're sort of arguing the

1006
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:13,290
other side of that's not the only

1007
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,570
customer Eric so maybe we shouldn't gate

1008
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:17,610
based on that is that correct yes there

1009
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:20,450
there are many people who have deployed

1010
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:22,790
this at scale already so there's plenty

1011
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:25,490
it's out there and if we want to wait on

1012
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,950
I can policy we could be here for 10

1013
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:30,069
years waiting on that to happen so we

1014
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:35,140
should not do that

1015
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:38,420
yeah yeah Jabbar scribed for Peter Cook

1016
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:40,009
who says I want to go agrees with step

1017
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,780
on this working group has not addressed

1018
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:48,740
the risk of policy laundering of the

1019
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:52,339
expression there on thanks I'm not quite

1020
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:55,879
as crisp as Peter this brick wall and so

1021
00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:57,470
to be clear it's not just I can policy

1022
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,460
that I was talking about its yes the I

1023
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:03,078
can policy there is incorporating

1024
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:05,329
particular privacy restrictions that are

1025
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:08,240
be that have been put in place by the GD

1026
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:10,250
P R so that's the issue of I camp policy

1027
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,348
that so just to be clear it's not that

1028
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:16,339
this group should be beholden I can't

1029
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:18,050
but that the GD P R is rippling into I

1030
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:20,060
camp policy which is causing a bunch of

1031
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,190
changes gonna cause a lot of change for

1032
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:25,220
a large number of implementers of this

1033
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:27,260
and so that's the only that's the key

1034
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,598
point there is that it's the GD P R

1035
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:32,270
trigger on I can't policy cuz I agree

1036
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,800
that I can't policy can and frequently

1037
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:36,680
it's all over the map this is a

1038
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:42,500
particular situation we know that you're

1039
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:45,980
the EC lot EC EU law GPR is coming in so

1040
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,329
they think so if I may I want to I'm

1041
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,520
gonna try and frame that back and

1042
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:51,290
actually make it even more general we

1043
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,660
did say just a little bit ago and it is

1044
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:55,730
true you know Spain's got us on this

1045
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:58,129
discussion we really do need to have a

1046
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,900
better privacy discussion about what

1047
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,910
goes in these drafts and for the privacy

1048
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,640
considerations and we need to address

1049
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:07,009
that much more carefully it's you know

1050
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,200
GDP are I can might be principal

1051
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:11,829
motivating factors but it really does

1052
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,240
need to be a general discussion about

1053
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:17,540
privacy and its effect on this

1054
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:20,299
registration data in general in all of

1055
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:21,619
the context in which it's used so that's

1056
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:26,930
definitely a discussion to take to the

1057
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:29,030
mailing list on these documents yes Jim

1058
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,109
Wilson Verisign one additional item

1059
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:32,200
since we're talking about

1060
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:33,740
implementations can we need for people

1061
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,160
implementation stats

1062
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:39,229
actions of these drafts to cover that

1063
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,640
yes that actually is a something that we

1064
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:43,100
should do I to mention that earlier

1065
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,230
thanks for that Jim when we're when I

1066
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:46,670
was asking you before about um whether

1067
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:48,950
there were implementations other than

1068
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:50,450
your own we should add that section into

1069
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:52,279
the draft so that it's there and things

1070
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:56,600
and get that on record as we're going

1071
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:57,980
forward okay so okay any other questions

1072
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:04,819
or comments were a little bit ahead of

1073
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:06,590
schedule so we have time go ahead one of

1074
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,780
the struggles I always have a running an

1075
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,280
implementation status section is my lack

1076
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,860
of knowledge of what other people are

1077
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,660
doing right so it's okay to sit here and

1078
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,220
say hey Mario put this text in there he

1079
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,500
can document is implementation

1080
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:22,189
experience but if you have implemented

1081
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:25,820
these drafts please let Mario know right

1082
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:27,320
so it makes his job easier to NSX when

1083
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,610
he knows what other people are doing and

1084
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,200
so in point

1085
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:35,060
I know excellent point thank you for

1086
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:37,100
that okay quick recap just keep in mind

1087
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,230
the first two documents we're thinking

1088
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,970
or relatively stable except now for

1089
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:43,580
dealing with privacy considerations and

1090
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:44,779
implementation status and and the regex

1091
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,250
weekly we have some additional

1092
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:49,010
discussion we're going to have here on

1093
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:50,900
some issues on the mailing list but okay

1094
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:53,660
you know please do come into the list

1095
01:01:50,900 --> 01:02:02,290
thank you all for your comments and

1096
01:01:53,660 --> 01:02:05,810
feedbacks okay next up on the agenda is

1097
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:10,029
an interesting topic discussion is this

1098
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:12,170
EPP our tap to stream model working and

1099
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:14,450
George Michaelson is going to come up

1100
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:17,690
and poke the bear

1101
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:20,299
I should be good that should be nice

1102
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:24,820
about that but please go ahead hi George

1103
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:29,960
here this is a very quick no slide talk

1104
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:32,600
it is too soon it is too soon to answer

1105
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,090
this question because we own the end to

1106
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:38,509
this phase of operation correct me if

1107
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:40,340
I'm wrong one ietf ago I think we we

1108
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:43,010
decided we would have this model in

1109
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,270
Prague didn't we yes yes oh you should

1110
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,300
see with the models hoping what I'm

1111
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,370
trying to do

1112
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:50,250
Here I am NOT trying to wreck the joint

1113
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:52,440
what I want you to do is I want you to

1114
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:55,170
keep in mind this question does the

1115
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,710
model work because I think we are going

1116
01:02:55,170 --> 01:03:02,490
to want to review this probably in two

1117
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:04,770
or three ietf time so I'm putting this

1118
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:07,709
on the table now so that we start

1119
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:11,640
thinking now is this producing a pace of

1120
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:13,650
work which works for us the reason I'm

1121
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,830
doing that is because the two document

1122
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:18,930
model it feels to me has potential to

1123
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:21,210
create a risk and an example of this

1124
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:23,279
would be we have here or document have

1125
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:25,530
substance the reverse search document

1126
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,110
and we now have a massive issue of

1127
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:30,360
substance the privacy issue and it's

1128
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,830
effectively going to block this is going

1129
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,780
to be something that I would believe you

1130
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:35,880
and Peter reasonably are going to say

1131
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,710
it's not tenable to progress this work

1132
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,890
if we do not adequately address a

1133
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:43,290
significant privacy and policy issue and

1134
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:45,779
so we're going to wind up probably and I

1135
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,850
know I'm predicting a chair behavior but

1136
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,040
the probable outcome is a substantive

1137
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:51,990
document and privacy is going to appear

1138
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,820
and it's going to be a blocker for a

1139
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:56,189
reverse search draft which means we're

1140
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,320
going to stack another document on top

1141
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,510
of the document stack we've got and the

1142
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,910
to document pace we're not going to

1143
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:05,060
progress these documents so there's a

1144
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:08,399
process aspect of necessarily

1145
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:11,790
discovering we have big work to do and

1146
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,010
all I wanted to do a my stress I am NOT

1147
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:17,190
trying to wreck the joint all I wanted

1148
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:19,380
to do is say start thinking now because

1149
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:22,680
this is going to come back probably in

1150
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:23,700
two or three IETF time is it working

1151
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,950
that was it

1152
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:31,319
questions discussion whatever the chair

1153
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:34,470
lets you do dancing lessons rhombus is

1154
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:37,920
very very deep one of the reasons that

1155
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:41,129
you have this is ad communication with

1156
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,400
the ad VAD asking you to gain your work

1157
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:47,190
and not dump everything in so what I'll

1158
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,790
say about that is that if unexpected

1159
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:53,000
things come up and you suddenly realize

1160
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:56,120
you need to do something new

1161
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,160
- that blocks other South I'm going to

1162
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,259
be flexible about allowing that to come

1163
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,569
into the stream I'm not going to stand

1164
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:04,460
here and say no you're already full you

1165
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:08,240
already have all the documents you can

1166
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:10,400
handle we're gonna negotiate yeah I mean

1167
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,959
that's good so no relation no yeah I'm

1168
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,400
not saying your question your question

1169
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,960
is a very good question and everybody

1170
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,750
needs to think about it but I'm just

1171
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,060
saying when you think about it be aware

1172
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:22,250
that while we have guidelines for

1173
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:24,350
progress of documents yeah I'm going to

1174
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:26,900
be flexible about that so I think what I

1175
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:28,520
would want to stress is be generous

1176
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:30,170
don't assume that we're heading to an oh

1177
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:33,850
it's not working outcome we should be

1178
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:36,080
generous and give it its chance and

1179
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,560
George I think you bring up a very good

1180
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,200
point

1181
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:44,140
I admire your ability to predict the

1182
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:50,470
future I got a horse on the 12:45 stakes

1183
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:52,400
Kentucky anyway

1184
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:54,109
my biggest question when you brought

1185
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,180
this up was did we actually write down

1186
01:05:54,110 --> 01:06:01,550
with us to three modelers and even going

1187
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:05,419
further is it in the Charter um this is

1188
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:08,030
a let's see the Charter does have us

1189
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,100
working in both of these areas so this

1190
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,390
is just a functional implementation of

1191
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,420
being allowed to work in both of those

1192
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:17,089
areas and we worked this out with the

1193
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:19,490
area director in March we just kind of

1194
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:22,160
proposed hey let's do this and we kind

1195
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:24,589
of had a verbal consensus from those in

1196
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:35,799
the room and no no objections I'm

1197
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:39,140
hairless no has to be the Charter I

1198
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,790
don't be hi ceremony about this but just

1199
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:43,759
some place that people can refer to it

1200
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:45,170
because when I was just like model again

1201
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,850
because I could barely remember from

1202
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,080
Prague so if we could have them running

1203
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:50,000
down someplace that's easily accessible

1204
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,970
I think would be great that's a good

1205
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,700
question and absolutely fair oh yeah but

1206
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:58,549
working up wiki which is good that's

1207
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:00,830
good for me yeah excellent suggestion

1208
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:06,090
maybe that the chairs will we'll take

1209
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:08,640
that action foundation

1210
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:12,600
I think we did Liberty shoot this model

1211
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,000
because historically this group answers

1212
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,330
are not being the most active to say the

1213
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,240
least

1214
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:23,759
and we wouldn't improve the situation by

1215
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:27,569
splitting us in two body groups because

1216
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:29,280
I mean people because we do work in

1217
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:33,360
groups doesn't mean we have 48 hours a

1218
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,680
day so well I'm gonna be over that I

1219
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,720
could be the other side of that

1220
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:39,089
conversation but I am trying to behave

1221
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:44,540
respectfully if a model we talk and all

1222
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:44,540
I'm saying is think let's think about it

1223
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:51,780
I mean I've said my piece that's all I

1224
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,270
needed

1225
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,100
thanks for listening okay No thank you

1226
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:58,020
George it is actually a valid question

1227
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,970
to ask you know whether whether the way

1228
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,740
in which we're working is working and

1229
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:04,680
that's important and it's useful and I'm

1230
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:06,629
glad that he raised the question and yes

1231
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,390
we should write this down and document

1232
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:11,880
it and and think about it and and after

1233
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:13,879
we've done this a couple of meetings or

1234
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,560
at least for a year so maybe next March

1235
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,940
we should make a point of bringing this

1236
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,580
question up again and sync that's

1237
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:22,500
working for us so we had some good

1238
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:25,529
motivation and reasons for creating this

1239
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,029
model and just something to try so we'll

1240
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:31,679
see

1241
01:08:26,029 --> 01:08:35,099
okay with that me pause for a moment to

1242
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:37,020
introduce this idea of new work and and

1243
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:41,220
what it means the reason why this is on

1244
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:44,640
here is yes we have a couple of

1245
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:46,200
documents that are in isg evaluation we

1246
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,980
have several documents which are

1247
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:53,099
targeted ideally to be pushed out for

1248
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:55,529
publication before the end of this year

1249
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:57,330
so before the next IETF meeting we have

1250
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:59,849
a set of documents that we're looking to

1251
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:03,029
move along and that opens up opportunity

1252
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:06,660
for us to consider new work it is true

1253
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:09,149
that we have quite a backlog of a dozen

1254
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:11,490
and a half or so documents that are

1255
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:13,769
potential for moving forward this is

1256
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:16,200
just another set of things to put in the

1257
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:18,120
mix for us to think about so we have a

1258
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,700
few people with some suggestions that we

1259
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,920
want to put on the table the

1260
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,779
have not been adopted by the working

1261
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,580
group yet but we're putting them out

1262
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:28,370
there for consideration because at some

1263
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:31,399
point here as we move between November

1264
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:33,349
and March IETF meetings we're gonna have

1265
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:36,559
to be thinking about which documents do

1266
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,450
we want to pull up to adopt and add to

1267
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,660
our milestone list to go forward so

1268
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:43,010
we're gonna add these to the mix as well

1269
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,090
as all of the other ones that we have

1270
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,500
okay

1271
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:48,860
so this is just calling them out for

1272
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:50,120
people so let's move through them here

1273
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:53,929
first thing you're actually going to do

1274
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,910
is this is we put it under new work but

1275
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:58,670
mark you want to come up and talk about

1276
01:09:55,910 --> 01:10:01,070
what's going on with our DAP deployment

1277
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:17,210
and findings Mark's been keeping quite a

1278
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:18,710
good document going for us here there

1279
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:24,140
you go and I believe that will work for

1280
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:29,270
you right yes good morning I'm not

1281
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:32,350
blushing this is about a position about

1282
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:35,780
this draft so all the details are there

1283
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:38,780
the context of this draft is that while

1284
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:42,139
developing various tools and in my team

1285
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:44,300
and myself related to our adapt so

1286
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:50,420
client servers and confirm installs with

1287
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:54,170
found many issues in the field some may

1288
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:56,660
have been corrected hopefully but the

1289
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:58,550
reality is not that much all the

1290
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:01,040
information about the guilty yard app

1291
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:06,140
servers are redacted so you're not going

1292
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:08,690
to be on this but some of you that's a

1293
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:13,580
many applies to domain but there's some

1294
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:17,660
applies to IP and AES registries um and

1295
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:20,210
that's the summary of the issues example

1296
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:24,740
of our values for example that are not

1297
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:27,140
inr registry or badly use these are

1298
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:31,250
examples on the left that we see on the

1299
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:32,749
field and possible good values on the

1300
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:37,070
right

1301
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:39,769
so it's kind of is sometimes I would say

1302
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:44,469
it's something knees enos of developers

1303
01:11:39,769 --> 01:11:47,239
not using the right strings or the

1304
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:52,400
reason but they don't register the

1305
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:57,768
values as they should in the RCS as said

1306
01:11:52,400 --> 01:12:00,320
in the ARP C's others like you know okay

1307
01:11:57,769 --> 01:12:06,019
instead of active or own urns that a

1308
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:07,909
registrant there's a it seems to be

1309
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:10,670
there's a need for a registry entity

1310
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:13,969
that is not yet model or identified for

1311
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:17,480
example in the u.s. we the registry

1312
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:21,429
itself is identify while in the air

1313
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:25,129
adapter sponsor does it's not identified

1314
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:27,409
itself and that's could be for for

1315
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:30,440
example providing info about the

1316
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:33,499
registry website for example another

1317
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,960
case we found is while we are working

1318
01:12:33,499 --> 01:12:39,489
with Diana is to have a downstream

1319
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:43,309
registry for example if that you request

1320
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:46,369
in the Ayana our dev server will

1321
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:49,159
actually answer for you know calm but

1322
01:12:46,369 --> 01:12:52,159
calm would actually you know in the

1323
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:55,339
response we should actually say this is

1324
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:58,940
the our dev server of that TLD right

1325
01:12:55,340 --> 01:13:02,329
that model is not it doesn't exist

1326
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:04,789
actually in air Deb should it be a rare

1327
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:09,860
down or a specific entry that's

1328
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:13,280
something that needs to be work out yeah

1329
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:15,259
are not extensions everyone almost every

1330
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:22,429
our web server has its own extensions

1331
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:24,789
they are not registered a Ana I can are

1332
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:31,010
that technical implementation guide and

1333
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:33,349
response profile are been registered and

1334
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:36,619
as you see there are some kind of a

1335
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:39,860
confusion on you know 0 or level or

1336
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:42,589
version and stuff so I guess we need

1337
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:44,478
probably to update the spec to make it

1338
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,860
here what what's the actual usage

1339
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:48,470
because it's

1340
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:50,809
just by seeing the values in the field

1341
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:53,780
it seems that you know there's a there's

1342
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:55,580
some probably some text to add and you

1343
01:13:53,780 --> 01:14:01,120
know please people register your

1344
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:06,350
extensions course is not set by some

1345
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:08,390
servers the RFC says recommended I think

1346
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:11,360
it we should say must if you are

1347
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:18,050
deploying in our DAP in server in the

1348
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:23,330
public Internet all kinds of things that

1349
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:29,510
I've seen in JSON responses object last

1350
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:32,090
name empty we seen other things links

1351
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:34,010
relation values different things

1352
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:38,990
including a URL which is completely

1353
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:41,210
buggy but those seems to be if you look

1354
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:43,429
at the registry for links relations

1355
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:46,880
there's like thousands of them being

1356
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:50,180
different defined with no real semantics

1357
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:53,270
being you know actually clearly defined

1358
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:56,270
so it it appears to me that people are

1359
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:58,940
just you know picking one and and then

1360
01:14:56,270 --> 01:15:01,400
we all will kind of losing semantics so

1361
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:03,830
it we might be an inspiration where we

1362
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,719
should probably you know do a little

1363
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:09,440
more work in defining those semantics

1364
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:16,220
correctly so people use the same value

1365
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:20,150
for the same semantics right seen this

1366
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:24,860
as you see the example is redacted the

1367
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:30,889
actual server but this is an example of

1368
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:35,000
self with related which points to itself

1369
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:38,870
a customer I had my client who was buggy

1370
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:42,860
was looking for you know going to the

1371
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:48,980
related then go the same object and then

1372
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:51,589
was doing a loop you know what

1373
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:54,650
mitigation maybe to update the RC -

1374
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:56,510
pretty bit this case and I'll give a

1375
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,290
little bit more details at the end for

1376
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:01,490
you know

1377
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:04,700
what we could do for a client if you

1378
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:06,920
send me a link without a rail I have no

1379
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:10,309
idea what to do with this thing you know

1380
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:14,140
what is this right how do I show it

1381
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:14,140
what's the semantics between this link

1382
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:20,809
we could update the RFC that says you

1383
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:24,680
know require value the Creator see

1384
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:27,230
especially response is pretty nice you

1385
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:30,530
know there's no requirement no you know

1386
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:32,870
you can do almost anything well okay so

1387
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:35,120
therefore they may be compliant but that

1388
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:38,300
doesn't tell me anything for the client

1389
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:42,260
site so we might like to tighten a bit

1390
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:44,570
the RFC or another possibility at the

1391
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:49,700
end I was thinking was maybe to have a

1392
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:51,950
BCP like you know that says you know you

1393
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:54,190
should while the RFC says you know

1394
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:57,679
you're free to do this you know you may

1395
01:16:54,190 --> 01:17:01,460
prefer to do this the BCP being generic

1396
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:05,540
for not related necessarily to I can you

1397
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:10,880
know gTLDs but you know for IP registry

1398
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:14,000
students for hours an interesting one in

1399
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:18,770
transition is always fun here's an

1400
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,110
example of the self and the href so

1401
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:26,270
again redacted but you know the real

1402
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:30,099
thing which is a mix of Unicode a label

1403
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:33,140
and you label in the URL

1404
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:35,660
well the self actually should be the

1405
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:38,600
kind of the unique you know identifiers

1406
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:42,639
for this object but the queries could be

1407
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:45,140
a mix of you labels or a labels right so

1408
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,380
you know what's what's the policy right

1409
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:53,440
so what's the real thing and the this

1410
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:56,600
actually this server was actually

1411
01:17:53,440 --> 01:18:00,290
reporting the self differently for the

1412
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:03,230
same object depending on the query so so

1413
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:05,120
I think again that the specification

1414
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:07,790
could be a bit more tightened and saying

1415
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,719
you know for the self always return the

1416
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:14,940
a labels or

1417
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:17,849
like that so it will be consistent this

1418
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:22,650
is to me about registrant which is

1419
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:28,440
within the entity of abuse not makes any

1420
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:31,820
sense to me but URL encoding so this is

1421
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:34,759
actually from the one of the are our

1422
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:39,808
because that's the only one that has

1423
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:43,559
Collins in the URL for request so when a

1424
01:18:39,809 --> 01:18:46,409
dir server actually accepted the first

1425
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:50,280
one but decline rejected the second one

1426
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:53,329
because it was person decoded I think

1427
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:57,239
I've been into the our season it's

1428
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:59,820
probably legitimate but not nice for the

1429
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:02,369
clients because some clients library is

1430
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:05,400
just you know personally encode as soon

1431
01:19:02,369 --> 01:19:08,549
as there's kind of a you know strange

1432
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:12,780
character in it and because the bad

1433
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:16,340
thing of URLs and schemas is that the

1434
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:20,400
depend on the which scheme the

1435
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:23,699
processing of the of the right side of

1436
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,679
the scheme it can be different so anyway

1437
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:32,190
so I think that would be a right thing

1438
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:37,920
to do yeah so this one is interesting

1439
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:41,610
I've seen different uses of rel equal

1440
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:45,510
related and the ICANN are that profile

1441
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:49,440
actually says this is the link to the

1442
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:52,199
essentially the registrar server to get

1443
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:55,909
the registrant information however I've

1444
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:59,030
seen other use of related which is

1445
01:19:55,909 --> 01:20:02,638
related means something larger than just

1446
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:07,139
registrar server therefore there's a

1447
01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:11,639
kind of a ambiguous semantics unrelated

1448
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:16,550
so I'm not sure what to do I guess the

1449
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:19,860
ship as the train already gone but maybe

1450
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:22,120
something like a new realm that would be

1451
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:24,880
registrant info would be more

1452
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:28,480
appropriate but I'm not sure what to do

1453
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:31,690
with this one search for things that are

1454
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:38,410
not so this is a reported to the two

1455
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:41,379
others of RFC 2482 and they agreed so I

1456
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:44,230
guess the wording was not clear about

1457
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:50,850
patterns when they were not patterns

1458
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:55,750
actually G cards this is the worst part

1459
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:57,640
look at the left one I mean so as a

1460
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:00,760
client what do I do you know nothing

1461
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:06,460
what do i display right essentially this

1462
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:08,920
v card is is empty seen in the field the

1463
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:11,830
right side they I don't know I think

1464
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:16,090
it's an easy developer I'm sorry if you

1465
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:21,940
are the person here but this one is the

1466
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:23,830
address and we just put an arrow while

1467
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:26,530
there's nothing to put in the area so it

1468
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:29,490
could be just you know coke right but

1469
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:33,160
they put an arrow with empty in it so

1470
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:35,769
you know I need to on my client site to

1471
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:38,260
actually look oh there's an Arri so I'm

1472
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:40,180
preparing to show the area like in

1473
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,110
multiple lines because that's that's

1474
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,790
what it is

1475
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:47,190
and then it's all empty so I need to

1476
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:47,190
revert and it's like you know please

1477
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:55,150
this is done bootstrap registries the he

1478
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:57,790
says you should have a training slash

1479
01:21:55,150 --> 01:22:00,160
not all we're done but actually it's

1480
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:03,160
been fixed it seemed because all now are

1481
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:08,920
done so good that my draft is being read

1482
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:12,490
by some people a comment I got from a

1483
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:15,400
few people I've seized 7480 for the

1484
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:18,900
bootstrap registries says you could

1485
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:22,540
specify a multiple or adapt servers and

1486
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:25,389
that was back in the world's working

1487
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:28,450
group discussions and there was ideas of

1488
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:32,140
maybe HTTP and HTTPS and maybe provide

1489
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:33,099
some level of redundancy what people

1490
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,379
were saying is

1491
01:22:33,099 --> 01:22:36,969
is just too much and that needed we

1492
01:22:35,379 --> 01:22:41,530
should have only one and it should be

1493
01:22:36,969 --> 01:22:45,929
HTTPS I don't know what to do is kind of

1494
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:49,090
bit late now but that's what it is

1495
01:22:45,929 --> 01:22:52,629
Bertrand status so the document contains

1496
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:54,669
obviously ephemeral issues you know bugs

1497
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:58,239
and implementations that should be

1498
01:22:54,669 --> 01:23:00,519
solved hopefully values to be registered

1499
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:04,598
in Ayana so that's something that should

1500
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:08,199
disappear obviously but I still think

1501
01:23:04,599 --> 01:23:10,840
and I've seen some people fixing the the

1502
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:12,699
bug the eff as this show though so I

1503
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:15,609
think there's a value of the document as

1504
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:18,759
it goes there are recommendations to

1505
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:21,519
specifications discussion points on all

1506
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:23,459
to improve and other topics I recently

1507
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:26,679
discovered and haven't got time to

1508
01:23:23,459 --> 01:23:29,169
document publish so two things we could

1509
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:32,199
do with this document just let it go

1510
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:34,719
continue should working group decide to

1511
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:37,178
update the specs then there's some

1512
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:40,239
recommendations there if we agreed to be

1513
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:42,489
followed in happy to start working on

1514
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:46,928
this or if the authors want to do

1515
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:50,648
whatever my my idea is to that it could

1516
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:52,869
become a BCP by having you know you know

1517
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:56,289
best current practice on things that you

1518
01:23:52,869 --> 01:24:00,070
should do and not do and remove all the

1519
01:23:56,289 --> 01:24:05,679
ephemeral issues that are gone so that's

1520
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:08,159
my presentation let me first start just

1521
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,209
by thanking you Mark for for doing this

1522
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:13,030
I'm sure you've heard that many times

1523
01:24:10,209 --> 01:24:15,010
from others who were on the receiving

1524
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:18,340
side of your having gone through and

1525
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:20,889
done this but really quite a just an

1526
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:23,499
enormous piece of work and very happy

1527
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:26,579
that you did this so let's sum quite a

1528
01:24:23,499 --> 01:24:29,949
few go in here let's go down the list

1529
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:31,959
this is awesome I think your group

1530
01:24:29,949 --> 01:24:34,358
should do something with it on BCP

1531
01:24:31,959 --> 01:24:36,849
whatever but this is exactly the type of

1532
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:39,309
thing the IETF should be doing so

1533
01:24:36,849 --> 01:24:41,499
hopefully we continue down that road I

1534
01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:41,820
don't know why people aren't registering

1535
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:45,870
there

1536
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:47,700
tensions with Diana I think maybe two

1537
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:55,200
designated experts or jerks

1538
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:58,200
I don't know let me offer something

1539
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,690
about this specific point will be well

1540
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:21,059
for the extensions I think you could yes

1541
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:22,620
who who is the guy I know there's some

1542
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:25,080
sort of other hang up in the ion or

1543
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:27,420
registration process that would be

1544
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:30,360
interesting to know as far as the fifty

1545
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:35,280
I think it's 5840 links registry or

1546
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:37,380
whatever that's a very good I thank you

1547
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,880
for pointing that out that's kind of a

1548
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:41,640
there's a lot of confusion around that

1549
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,530
and I personally have never registered

1550
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:46,290
anything in there and I don't know I'm

1551
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:48,480
not sure what the process is so maybe we

1552
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:50,700
need to look at that and you know we

1553
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:55,559
wanted to use things that the IETF had

1554
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:58,139
already standardized Jake are and so

1555
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:01,170
that's what we went with the 5840 links

1556
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:06,270
registry as well and you look through

1557
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:16,770
the what's already registered and some

1558
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:19,800
of its kind of like so maybe more

1559
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:23,010
appropriate that's exactly the point

1560
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:25,680
that maybe it's not a real you know RFC

1561
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:27,750
protocol standard but the BCP would fit

1562
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,940
well you know with in there that you

1563
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:31,980
know here's the you know values and

1564
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:34,110
semantics we understand and we you

1565
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:37,500
should do those kinds of things instead

1566
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:39,690
of using you know weird link values for

1567
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,790
example yeah so two more points the I

1568
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:44,339
know you're not kind of shame people but

1569
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:46,080
as a server operator I would like to

1570
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:48,510
know if I violate any of these things so

1571
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,980
you're welcome to send me all sorts of

1572
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:50,530
the emails name I mean otherwise I can't

1573
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,468
picture that

1574
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:55,840
I don't know it's broken again takes it

1575
01:26:52,469 --> 01:27:04,260
the other thing is that I've done some

1576
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:04,260
not exhaustive because I became wait but

1577
01:27:09,749 --> 01:27:16,478
and there's some issues that I found

1578
01:27:12,849 --> 01:27:18,989
that I didn't put in the draft because I

1579
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:25,479
contacted the guys and this is like

1580
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:36,728
awful please fix it and then she cards

1581
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:38,499
example the other thing is is that this

1582
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:40,510
isn't in the document there are several

1583
01:27:38,499 --> 01:27:43,420
people who created tools Aaron has tools

1584
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:45,280
a peanut has tools you have tools and I

1585
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:47,949
don't know why people aren't using them

1586
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:50,018
to validate their servers so maybe if we

1587
01:27:47,949 --> 01:27:51,428
should maybe that in a section in the

1588
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:52,420
documents saying by the way here's all

1589
01:27:51,429 --> 01:27:53,619
these tools that can help you figure

1590
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:55,960
this stuff out or at least so you can

1591
01:27:53,619 --> 01:28:00,969
point out if you have problems well okay

1592
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:02,559
thanks thanks thank you it's got all be

1593
01:28:00,969 --> 01:28:04,960
a plus one to everything he may be said

1594
01:28:02,559 --> 01:28:07,929
but a couple of additional points with

1595
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,369
respect to the extension stuff I have to

1596
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:11,260
admit even though I know I'm one of the

1597
01:28:09,369 --> 01:28:13,509
guilty parties who is responsible for

1598
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:16,300
writing that document when I wrote the

1599
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:17,889
object tag draft which had a requirement

1600
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:21,099
you know to add a new our data

1601
01:28:17,889 --> 01:28:22,510
conformance value I was looking at 74 83

1602
01:28:21,099 --> 01:28:25,210
and I have to admit I was confused

1603
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:28,300
because there are places where it uses

1604
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:30,280
examples of a string like lunar Nick and

1605
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,349
in other places it uses lunatic level

1606
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,639
zero yeah so I'm significant okay so

1607
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:38,920
what should I do with this object I

1608
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:47,739
think I got it wrong so and you are one

1609
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:52,809
of the author of a need for us to read

1610
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:53,499
spin 74 82 and 74 83 at a minimum right

1611
01:28:52,809 --> 01:28:55,090
yeah

1612
01:28:53,499 --> 01:28:56,679
there's enough here that we are learning

1613
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:58,840
as a result of implementing these

1614
01:28:56,679 --> 01:29:00,579
footballs yeah and which is just great

1615
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,699
yeah proposed there proposed standards

1616
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:04,110
right it doesn't mean we got it right

1617
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:06,719
really right

1618
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:08,219
there's things we need to fix and I am

1619
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,850
certainly willing to put some energy

1620
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:14,670
into starting that process 74 84 I'm

1621
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:18,810
less than good stuff but hey let's talk

1622
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:21,360
about it right now thank you Rick great

1623
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:25,100
thanks I'm critical embarrassin tactical

1624
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:27,960
thing you mentioned in here the course

1625
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:31,230
requiring the course with a train to get

1626
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:33,989
to a must in the heart out and profile

1627
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:36,690
that's used in the gTLD space that there

1628
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:38,790
is a item in there that requires it to

1629
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:40,650
be a must as general agreement yeah

1630
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:45,119
because we found it to be useful to

1631
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:49,980
tighten that up I mean the ATF knows I'm

1632
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:53,809
kind of a you know more general I'm just

1633
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:57,330
for people that are that don't know

1634
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:59,850
marks IETF regex document has been

1635
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:02,639
getting a lot of air time and attention

1636
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:06,179
in the in an ardent group that meets

1637
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:09,270
basically weekly ICANN accredited

1638
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:11,969
registrar's and registries that are that

1639
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:14,969
are doing our dad implementations and so

1640
01:30:11,969 --> 01:30:16,889
while it's getting some attention here

1641
01:30:14,969 --> 01:30:18,449
is getting a lot of attention live in a

1642
01:30:16,889 --> 01:30:20,100
community that communities it's

1643
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:22,860
certainly thankful appreciative to all

1644
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:25,320
the work that mark has done in regards

1645
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:27,389
to documenting these problem yeah well

1646
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:31,530
just to respond to that um I think

1647
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:34,469
there's like fixture bugs kind of issues

1648
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:36,840
and also in in the same document which

1649
01:30:34,469 --> 01:30:39,360
is okay I think for now but at the end

1650
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,520
we'll have to you know cleaning up is

1651
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,159
you know recommendations for you know

1652
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,960
new versions of specs or maybe BCP

1653
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:48,769
deployment and you know there's a mix of

1654
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:51,630
different things but I hope that they

1655
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:53,310
but you know I can community will

1656
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:58,320
actually fix the bugs at least so those

1657
01:30:53,310 --> 01:31:00,960
will disappear the notion of flipping

1658
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:04,290
this more thing this evolving it to a

1659
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,030
PCP I think that's a great idea I would

1660
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:08,429
offer that right now it's probably more

1661
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:10,679
of a collection of anti patterns and so

1662
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:12,330
I think that yeah the PC the best

1663
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:14,040
current practice part is probably going

1664
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:16,320
to evolve over the next of course

1665
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,199
several months but yeah yeah that seems

1666
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:21,579
like like

1667
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:23,799
good idea thank you let's go it's Jim

1668
01:31:21,579 --> 01:31:28,959
goes embarrassing Rick just stole my

1669
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:32,679
thunder I was gonna call them and type I

1670
01:31:28,959 --> 01:31:33,579
really support the work I'm sure the

1671
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:36,610
registers would have really appreciated

1672
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:38,590
this for you can be the way that I

1673
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:40,478
process this particular documents I

1674
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:42,219
looked at things that work when I

1675
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,530
consider implementation issues of

1676
01:31:42,219 --> 01:31:47,199
specifically publication issues we're on

1677
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:49,059
our issues as well as like RFC no

1678
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:51,400
feedback so if they're I'm not sure how

1679
01:31:49,059 --> 01:31:55,619
you even categorize those things that's

1680
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,619
how I was doing identified who would

1681
01:31:56,579 --> 01:32:02,199
agree right now it's not fully it's more

1682
01:31:59,739 --> 01:32:04,388
like a book of you know Canada a

1683
01:32:02,199 --> 01:32:06,728
structured logbook of what I found and

1684
01:32:04,389 --> 01:32:07,300
you know obviously we'll tighten up as

1685
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:11,139
we go

1686
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:12,909
yeah agreed hi Marie I want to do agree

1687
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:14,559
with some things God said which is oh my

1688
01:32:12,909 --> 01:32:16,539
goodness the process is working we have

1689
01:32:14,559 --> 01:32:18,670
required experience let's go update the

1690
01:32:16,539 --> 01:32:21,239
status track document so terrific if I

1691
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:23,249
can help with that in any way as a

1692
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:26,320
participant in the former Terra weirds

1693
01:32:23,249 --> 01:32:28,749
please let me know one thing though as I

1694
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,280
skim the Charter the Turner doesn't talk

1695
01:32:28,749 --> 01:32:31,539
about modifying those you might have to

1696
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,518
tweak it if you need help

1697
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:35,709
radio chatter text um help do that

1698
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:37,679
excellent assistant movie this long as

1699
01:32:35,709 --> 01:32:43,239
much as I can

1700
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:48,290
that's not what I said no he wants to be

1701
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:53,009
in the next ad oh that's an um come time

1702
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:53,010
[Laughter]

1703
01:32:53,099 --> 01:33:02,619
Yuri chartering is a when you were

1704
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:05,559
talking about the problem of

1705
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:09,579
relinquishing types as well not leave

1706
01:33:05,559 --> 01:33:12,610
unused consistent way you are thinking

1707
01:33:09,579 --> 01:33:14,499
of fixing the registry of types all

1708
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:26,110
fixing down laptop humans

1709
01:33:14,499 --> 01:33:28,030
ah good question I should be away from

1710
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:30,289
complete you just have to read the

1711
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:33,170
registry yeah

1712
01:33:30,289 --> 01:33:37,429
i-i-i i'm not sure at the moment i was

1713
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:40,610
more kind of raising the issue you know

1714
01:33:37,429 --> 01:33:43,309
either way I don't know I'm obviously if

1715
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:45,920
it's the link relation type registry to

1716
01:33:43,309 --> 01:33:49,369
fix then dad discussion should probably

1717
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:54,070
be somewhere and art you know Aria

1718
01:33:49,369 --> 01:33:59,598
somewhere but or HTTP I don't know but I

1719
01:33:54,070 --> 01:34:01,699
I don't have a good suggestion at the

1720
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:04,969
moment I was more reasoning the issue in

1721
01:34:01,699 --> 01:34:09,320
see you know where is the right place to

1722
01:34:04,969 --> 01:34:11,869
do in some ways this you know the

1723
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:15,170
registry itself is full of stuff you

1724
01:34:11,869 --> 01:34:18,199
know if we're going my back to dick well

1725
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:22,719
okay but there is so many to pick right

1726
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:27,219
and in some ways a lot of them are

1727
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:29,780
essentially irrelevant to our adapt and

1728
01:34:27,219 --> 01:34:32,210
asking the community to go back and then

1729
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:34,670
put semantics and all those may be

1730
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:39,079
something that will never happen even if

1731
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:42,139
we ask so I always maybe a bit towards

1732
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:45,860
let's do a BCP or something and define

1733
01:34:42,139 --> 01:34:47,690
the key values that are useful in the

1734
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:50,869
air that context and have the clear

1735
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:54,138
semantics for our DAP maybe that doesn't

1736
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:58,449
fly I don't know but I'm almost hurtful

1737
01:34:54,139 --> 01:34:58,449
in this I'm just raising the issue first

1738
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:08,239
because I wasn't the impression that the

1739
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:11,239
client was right in using us in some

1740
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:13,669
coding on one of the point of other is

1741
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:15,230
that we rely on HTTP so we we use

1742
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:17,900
everything we don't have to define

1743
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:21,230
everything by ourselves we just say okay

1744
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:24,799
look at the UI spec of the HTTP spec so

1745
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:32,360
it is it really so ambiguous in the you

1746
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:35,980
are your eyes back my guess was I found

1747
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,980
a loss

1748
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,790
to all this because it's actually

1749
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:45,559
depending on the scheme right

1750
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:51,170
so it's I've been the co-chair of

1751
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:55,500
unsuccessful working group call I are I

1752
01:35:51,170 --> 01:36:00,120
that was no fun so anyway I'm just

1753
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:01,790
saying you know both both kind of

1754
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:06,320
queries should be supported by all

1755
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:11,820
servers because client lives often do

1756
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:12,719
kind of a to escape of if this is scheme

1757
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:15,360
number one

1758
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:18,270
then I should percent and code only

1759
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:21,110
these characters and if it's scheme

1760
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:25,440
number two percent and kind of the other

1761
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:25,920
you know characters the lips are just

1762
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,809
lazy

1763
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:31,290
you know whenever there's you know

1764
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:33,900
almost on ASCII things percent-encoded

1765
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:35,970
all the time so that's that's the

1766
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:39,230
behavior of the standard lips at least

1767
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:42,570
the lips I've seen so I was sending

1768
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:45,360
percent-encoded by my client and then it

1769
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:49,049
was rejected it was like what

1770
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:59,610
I think the server should be liberal and

1771
01:36:49,050 --> 01:37:04,860
accepting both I think we should

1772
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:07,469
probably true I've read the RFC and I've

1773
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:10,650
read the Italian registry and I get

1774
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:12,870
confused by it I don't want to step on

1775
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:16,110
it or anything like that so you know

1776
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:18,750
he's a he's probably just asking what he

1777
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:24,719
thinks the right thing we do this but a

1778
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:26,940
completely agree yeah maybe we should

1779
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:30,390
also consider what clients should do in

1780
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:33,570
the BCP that's necessary yeah yeah I

1781
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:35,490
think both sides are could be you know

1782
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:40,799
some recommendations on behaviors for

1783
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:45,330
the BCP okay thanks very much next up

1784
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:48,320
for a potential work is Jim gold with

1785
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:51,380
secured authorization transfer

1786
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,840
thank you so yeah this this draft was

1787
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:57,440
recently published and its primary

1788
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:59,840
purpose is to address the increased

1789
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:04,339
dependency on the authorization info

1790
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:07,550
value in essence the the goal here is to

1791
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:10,370
provide a more secure way of managing

1792
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:12,679
the authorization info while using the

1793
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:15,790
existing features within the EPP rfcs

1794
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:20,239
but what's out of scope in this is the

1795
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:23,630
transfer process policy things like the

1796
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:25,370
form of authorization or the the

1797
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:28,280
implementation of an immediate transfer

1798
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:32,510
or even defining the concrete time to

1799
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:34,489
live for an authorization info so the

1800
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:36,739
elements of this draft include three

1801
01:38:34,489 --> 01:38:39,230
different things the first thing is the

1802
01:38:36,739 --> 01:38:42,230
use of a strong random authorization

1803
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:46,250
info value the reality here is that the

1804
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:48,530
this is a generated value and to

1805
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:51,460
increase the security is to ensure that

1806
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:53,870
we have the appropriate level of

1807
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:56,679
randomness specifically the

1808
01:38:53,870 --> 01:39:00,050
recommendation is 128 bits of entropy

1809
01:38:56,679 --> 01:39:02,960
for the value the good news is the fact

1810
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:08,060
that the epp RFC doesn't have any length

1811
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:10,730
restrictions for the authentic in

1812
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:13,969
element is to make the auth in fort lid

1813
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:16,099
to be able to do that the server needs

1814
01:39:13,969 --> 01:39:20,060
to be able to allow for them to be unset

1815
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:22,760
many service a day don't do that but the

1816
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:25,429
RFC does in fact support the unset you

1817
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:28,489
know the authorization info the other

1818
01:39:25,429 --> 01:39:30,500
thing is that the the authorization

1819
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:33,799
intro would only be set during the

1820
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:35,420
transfer process so therefore there's no

1821
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:37,370
need for an authorization info unless

1822
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:40,730
there's actually a transfer that is

1823
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:43,940
occurring the other item is to be able

1824
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:45,678
to support a TTL that his client managed

1825
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:47,330
in essence the registrar's would have to

1826
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,610
keep ability to be able to find what

1827
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:51,769
that time of live is and use the

1828
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:55,070
features of the server to be able to

1829
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:57,170
unset it when that TTL expire so the

1830
01:39:55,070 --> 01:40:00,380
more the critical the domain name the

1831
01:39:57,170 --> 01:40:01,010
lower the TTL would be and then the last

1832
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:05,000
islands

1833
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:06,620
storage specifically whether or not the

1834
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,870
authentic should be stored in the

1835
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:10,790
registrar if it's stored in the registry

1836
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:12,950
how it should be stored the

1837
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:16,160
recommendation out of this graft is that

1838
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:18,620
the Registrar does not store the value

1839
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,330
at all it generates it it provides it to

1840
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:22,809
the Registrar and there's no need to

1841
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:25,430
storage so there's no risk of somebody

1842
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:28,910
within the registrar having access to

1843
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:31,160
that value additionally in the registry

1844
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:34,280
it's the store it even in one way hash

1845
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:36,680
so similarly there's less risk of

1846
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:42,259
somebody being able to have access to

1847
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:45,530
that authorization info value so if you

1848
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:47,990
go by this operational practice these

1849
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:50,450
are the steps for a transfer it first

1850
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:53,530
starts out with a create so the domain

1851
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:55,670
has to be created during the create the

1852
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:57,830
authorization info would be passed as an

1853
01:40:55,670 --> 01:40:59,390
empty value there's no need for the

1854
01:40:57,830 --> 01:41:01,640
authorization info at the time create

1855
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:04,220
because there's no transfer when the

1856
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:06,920
registrant wants to transfer what

1857
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:09,800
they'll do is they'll go to the losing

1858
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:13,490
registrar which will then generate a

1859
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:15,410
strong random value the Registrar will

1860
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:17,389
provide it to the Registrar and also

1861
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:20,210
pass it through the registry which will

1862
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:22,580
store it as a one-way hash then what

1863
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:24,860
will happen is that the registrant will

1864
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:27,320
go to the gain registrar provide the

1865
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:30,799
authorization info which will then be

1866
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:32,570
can be pre checked using the info

1867
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,670
command which accepts the authorization

1868
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:35,900
info and then they can go ahead and

1869
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:38,120
submit it with the transfer request

1870
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:40,730
which the registry will hash it compare

1871
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:41,360
the hashes if they're match then it's

1872
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:44,629
all good

1873
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:47,360
the last thing is when the transfer

1874
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:49,700
successfully goes through the registry

1875
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:52,160
will auto unset it so in essence it's

1876
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:53,690
like a create so a transfer process is

1877
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:57,530
complete and the registry can go ahead

1878
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:59,540
and auto clear it so in looking at the

1879
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:01,700
epp RFC's I wanted to see whether or not

1880
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:04,970
the RFC supported what was defined

1881
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:06,530
within this practice the first thing is

1882
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:09,740
to be able to create with the empty auth

1883
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:11,870
info it can so the fact that matter is

1884
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:14,840
that there's no length restrictions on

1885
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:18,320
the auth info there's an ability to be

1886
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:20,780
pass an empty value which allows us to

1887
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:23,840
feel support this the next is the

1888
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:24,949
ability to be unset the auth info it

1889
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,340
just happens that there's two different

1890
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:31,098
ways to do this in the domain RFC it

1891
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:33,139
actually has an explicit element to be

1892
01:42:31,099 --> 01:42:35,270
able to unset the author for it's called

1893
01:42:33,139 --> 01:42:37,880
domain norm I'm not sure if you know

1894
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:39,139
about that element I found that out and

1895
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:42,860
then there's the other way where you can

1896
01:42:39,139 --> 01:42:45,080
just pass the MPE domain PW element the

1897
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:48,409
contact RFC which also has authorization

1898
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:52,040
and fill values does not support the

1899
01:42:48,409 --> 01:42:55,460
corresponding contact element and then

1900
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:58,280
the next is to be able to update and use

1901
01:42:55,460 --> 01:43:01,070
a strong offense Oval you again there's

1902
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:03,559
no restrictions on length there is an

1903
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:07,070
issue related to inclusion of a space in

1904
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:11,030
the random value it just happens that

1905
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:13,549
whitespace is replaced in the external

1906
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:16,610
parser so it might be a good idea not to

1907
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:19,909
include the space the last thing is that

1908
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:21,920
if the registry is storing it as a

1909
01:43:19,909 --> 01:43:24,860
one-way hash they cannot return the

1910
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:27,260
value in the info response that is an

1911
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:32,409
optional value in the epp RFC so it can

1912
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:36,500
be a can be supported so in conclusion

1913
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:38,179
this BCP is meant to enhance the

1914
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:40,460
security of the authorization info

1915
01:43:38,179 --> 01:43:42,290
without the need for any new EPP

1916
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:45,320
extension just utilizing the features

1917
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:47,780
that already exist and the EPP rfcs and

1918
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:50,090
the idea here is the fact that the

1919
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:54,590
authorization info is only set during

1920
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:56,090
the transfer process the client the

1921
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:58,940
Katyn this case the registrar can go

1922
01:43:56,090 --> 01:44:00,560
ahead and manage a TTL since the server

1923
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:03,559
can support an unsetting of the

1924
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:06,230
authorization info and then the storage

1925
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,969
is secured by not storing it in the

1926
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:10,669
registrar and only storing it as a

1927
01:44:07,969 --> 01:44:13,639
one-way hash in the registry and so I

1928
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:19,429
encourage you to review and provide

1929
01:44:13,639 --> 01:44:21,679
feedback for this draft and this is very

1930
01:44:19,429 --> 01:44:24,380
what is the intended status of this

1931
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:27,000
traffic right now it would be a BCP so

1932
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:29,850
let me put a bug in your here too

1933
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:37,290
look up ye applicability statement it's

1934
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:39,930
okay no RFC 2026 this is not this seems

1935
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:42,630
to me to be more of a standards track

1936
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:45,390
thing of this is how you do this not a

1937
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:47,300
best practices and on applicability

1938
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:49,710
statement is exactly that it's a

1939
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:51,810
standards track specification that says

1940
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:54,780
how to use existing standards to

1941
01:44:51,810 --> 01:45:00,150
accomplish something so consider that

1942
01:44:54,780 --> 01:45:03,570
okay thank you hi this is no measure

1943
01:45:00,150 --> 01:45:07,889
from the Swedish internet registry yeah

1944
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:11,130
that's exactly what we do you do this

1945
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:11,850
oh good yeah that's good okay cheer oh

1946
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:15,720
I'm sorry

1947
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:20,820
do you support unsetting yes I'm sitting

1948
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:24,570
and pretty sure about that and B's story

1949
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:29,009
to the Psalter - and never returned it

1950
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:30,620
to the info request okay well maybe you

1951
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:37,500
can provide your implementation status

1952
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:40,769
information I can add it to it okay sure

1953
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:42,600
hit the last is your implementation

1954
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:45,270
allowed to register on - saying that

1955
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,920
what doing the create can you keep me in

1956
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:50,160
focus

1957
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:53,130
having dead I think that the register on

1958
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:56,099
have disadvantage because for the time

1959
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:58,830
that you want to transfer he had to

1960
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:00,720
contact the losing that just drop at

1961
01:45:58,830 --> 01:46:02,430
that time I don't know that because I

1962
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:04,890
want to transfer without do it they're

1963
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:06,570
losing register and also I know it's an

1964
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:08,550
implementation people have to do it can

1965
01:46:06,570 --> 01:46:11,309
do or not by just thinking that a

1966
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:14,040
register on on appeal that would be

1967
01:46:11,310 --> 01:46:14,850
using my disadvantage yeah I didn't know

1968
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,920
I'm saying you say there's a

1969
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:18,720
disadvantage to manage because as a

1970
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:21,510
registrant when I created my name I

1971
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:24,660
would like to get my info so anytime a

1972
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:26,760
lot of times but I can do it well I

1973
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:28,680
guess the question is that how many

1974
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:32,850
registrar's out there actually allow for

1975
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:36,720
the registrant to set or have access to

1976
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:39,200
their authorization info at the time of

1977
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,200
creator guys

1978
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:46,780
um we don't allow the registrar to set

1979
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:48,970
up and we generally don't like to give

1980
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:50,590
them the off-color on registration

1981
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:53,680
because the domain can't be transferred

1982
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:57,940
for 60 days this is for GTA news anyway

1983
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:59,800
and we don't it's a risk to have that

1984
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:01,389
off code out there and have the customer

1985
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:03,430
forget that they actually happen and

1986
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:04,810
it's in an email somewhere the email

1987
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:08,250
gets hacked and the domain is gone

1988
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:10,990
because they had so it's something that

1989
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:12,610
we'd like to see the auth code don't

1990
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:15,010
don't ask for it until you're ready to

1991
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:17,830
transfer so that it's out there for just

1992
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:26,920
a little bit amount of time that is my

1993
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:32,650
concern to customer okay thank you Tom

1994
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:44,500
Harrison yeah there is this is gonna be

1995
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:48,540
a five-minute discussion right okay so

1996
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:50,980
this is about a profile for Jacob

1997
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:55,210
there's been a fair amount of criticism

1998
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:59,500
of Jacob from implementers on both the

1999
01:47:55,210 --> 01:48:01,180
server side and client side some of that

2000
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:04,030
is about the structure of Jacob

2001
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:06,370
particularly its use of arrays for

2002
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:09,660
things like attributes and also for

2003
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:13,059
delivery addresses the structured part

2004
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:16,450
some of it is about V code which

2005
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:18,310
underlies Jacob and Israeli comp is

2006
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:20,950
really a comprehensive contact

2007
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:22,720
information specification that includes

2008
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:25,000
a bunch of stuff that at least on its

2009
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:28,960
face isn't really relevant in the Artic

2010
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:31,660
context a profile obviously can't do

2011
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,540
anything about the structural issues but

2012
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:37,000
it can at least limit the surface area

2013
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:42,160
of the card that implementers need to

2014
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:43,780
worry about in the Artic context we have

2015
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:46,450
an add up server we have some investment

2016
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:49,450
in J card we're interested to avoid

2017
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:50,639
having to switch formats if we can so we

2018
01:48:49,450 --> 01:48:53,280
thought we'd put this up

2019
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:56,190
and see if it will be enough to address

2020
01:48:53,280 --> 01:49:00,240
people's concerns about J cards use in

2021
01:48:56,190 --> 01:49:01,559
this context the document itself is

2022
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:04,050
really straightforward

2023
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,720
we took the servers that are in the eye

2024
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:08,970
on a bootstrap file got a few objects

2025
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:11,040
from each of them and effectively did

2026
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:14,460
the union of what those servers used

2027
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,070
from J card and documented it a couple

2028
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:19,920
of extra things on top of that language

2029
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:23,179
and alt ID tags because we're intending

2030
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:26,670
to do multilingual stuff fairly soon and

2031
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:27,920
also the extension is defined in RFC

2032
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:33,300
8605

2033
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:35,190
because they're specific for add up so

2034
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:37,470
we're interested for those who have

2035
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:40,580
raised issues with J card if this is

2036
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:43,620
enough to head off switching formats

2037
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:46,140
though the list traffic today indicates

2038
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:47,760
that it probably isn't in the event that

2039
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:50,160
it is does anything else need to be

2040
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,800
included and then at a more general

2041
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:53,430
level if people are concerned about free

2042
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,920
cards

2043
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:58,560
complexity but perhaps not interested in

2044
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,960
the profile approach do we need to

2045
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:07,310
discuss getting more and/or better check

2046
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:07,310
our libraries for implementers thanks

2047
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:13,080
this is very this is not binding on you

2048
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:15,750
in any way but the ADEs think that Jas

2049
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:17,430
contact is a better approach were is

2050
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:23,730
likely to be a better approach anyway

2051
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:26,450
it's still under development so any

2052
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:26,450
other comments or questions

2053
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:32,400
this Shingleton Barrow Stein this may be

2054
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:34,500
obvious based on discussions on the

2055
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:39,240
mailing list but is there consents thats

2056
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:41,190
related to the Whipsnade CJ cart I know

2057
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:44,760
that we talked about you know redoing

2058
01:50:41,190 --> 01:50:47,070
the RFC potentially but these are

2059
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:48,960
consensus and in essence then once the

2060
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:53,030
consensus that we need to replace it

2061
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,030
then identify what to replace it with

2062
01:50:57,349 --> 01:51:01,579
and you need I support and actually come

2063
01:51:00,139 --> 01:51:03,949
to figure out how to do the best we can

2064
01:51:01,579 --> 01:51:05,780
with J card at the moment we already

2065
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:09,940
have many people who have implemented J

2066
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:12,880
card I've done it four times already so

2067
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:18,888
we there's plenty of deployment of this

2068
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:20,780
yeah J card is screwy but it's not that

2069
01:51:18,889 --> 01:51:25,520
scurry I've come across worse things in

2070
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:27,170
the ietf much worse things and to be

2071
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:29,179
honest as far as they are tobiko systems

2072
01:51:27,170 --> 01:51:32,570
go I think the bootstrap registries are

2073
01:51:29,179 --> 01:51:37,489
far more structurally unsound than then

2074
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:39,889
J card is so the I've I favor just

2075
01:51:37,489 --> 01:51:42,199
trying to go forward with J card the

2076
01:51:39,889 --> 01:51:44,179
only and I will note that having been on

2077
01:51:42,199 --> 01:51:46,699
both sides of the communications both as

2078
01:51:44,179 --> 01:51:49,340
a server and a client for servers it's

2079
01:51:46,699 --> 01:51:51,348
not that it's it's hard to interpret the

2080
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:54,110
RFC sometimes but once you get it you

2081
01:51:51,349 --> 01:51:56,719
got it it's the clients where it really

2082
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:59,900
it really is problematic and that's

2083
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:02,090
where profile will help if we switch to

2084
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:04,070
something else that then we start

2085
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:06,679
talking about you know flag days or

2086
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:09,079
something know how that transition is

2087
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:10,849
going to work and so there there are a

2088
01:52:09,079 --> 01:52:12,769
whole lot of questions about switching

2089
01:52:10,849 --> 01:52:14,780
to it so I prefer us to at least try to

2090
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:28,010
do the best we can with J card for the

2091
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:29,659
time being I knew Jenkins I can't

2092
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:31,520
comment on whether it's suitable or not

2093
01:52:29,659 --> 01:52:33,920
I've been involved with it

2094
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:38,570
J s contact at Owens wanted a few quick

2095
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:42,380
comments on that two things firstly one

2096
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:44,000
of the explicit goals is that it well

2097
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:46,670
being fully featured it scales for

2098
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,020
simple use cases to be really simple it

2099
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:51,050
should appear simple if you're only

2100
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:52,820
using a few bits of it we J as calendar

2101
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:56,000
which is the kind of iCalendar

2102
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:57,650
equivalent of this is in last call

2103
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,909
Norma's published that perhaps gives you

2104
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:00,619
a better idea of how that works if

2105
01:52:58,909 --> 01:53:02,920
you're creating very simpler then it

2106
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:05,509
looks super simple it's real easy to use

2107
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:07,849
we one of the problems with things like

2108
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:08,219
gay Cal and J card is even the simple

2109
01:53:07,849 --> 01:53:10,380
stuff

2110
01:53:08,219 --> 01:53:13,139
it's horrendous to work with them not

2111
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:16,800
the way anyone uses JSON outside of

2112
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:19,530
those systems so in that respect your

2113
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,809
body were good having said that joke on

2114
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:24,840
tact bit is not as developed it's that's

2115
01:53:21,809 --> 01:53:27,059
still going to take some months at least

2116
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:31,229
to finish I don't know what the deadline

2117
01:53:27,059 --> 01:53:32,940
is this whether that's an issue a lot if

2118
01:53:31,229 --> 01:53:35,249
you did want to use it we got more

2119
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:37,678
people to get on board with helping

2120
01:53:35,249 --> 01:53:39,179
develop and finish it it's certainly

2121
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,099
something that is going to be happening

2122
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:44,340
regardless of its adopting but it

2123
01:53:41,099 --> 01:53:47,489
stopped it here I think could a need to

2124
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:51,479
cut the queue at George Barry not

2125
01:53:47,489 --> 01:53:55,619
speaking as an ad the so in response to

2126
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:57,539
Jim and Andy I suggest that rather than

2127
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:59,549
saying first we should figure out

2128
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:00,478
whether to replace J card and then look

2129
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:03,659
at alternatives

2130
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:06,300
I suggest that considering J is contact

2131
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:08,249
as an alternative while you're making

2132
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:11,249
the decision is a better approach

2133
01:54:08,249 --> 01:54:14,219
because as Andy said you know yes other

2134
01:54:11,249 --> 01:54:16,170
things suck worse but that's not a good

2135
01:54:14,219 --> 01:54:18,539
reason to stick with things on the other

2136
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:22,440
hand existing two planes are so it's all

2137
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:24,869
part of the decision hi George here I

2138
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:28,949
think I might have a question an

2139
01:54:24,869 --> 01:54:30,719
implicit question to the implementer so

2140
01:54:28,949 --> 01:54:32,909
I've got kind of two or three points to

2141
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:35,309
try and make it I want to echo what

2142
01:54:32,909 --> 01:54:37,079
Thomas said that this is quite important

2143
01:54:35,309 --> 01:54:38,999
for us in terms of our son cost of

2144
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:41,159
investment and I know that is not a very

2145
01:54:38,999 --> 01:54:43,050
compelling argument in a community with

2146
01:54:41,159 --> 01:54:44,999
many many activities who have yet to

2147
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:46,889
make an investment but nonetheless

2148
01:54:44,999 --> 01:54:48,749
there's a tussle going on here between

2149
01:54:46,889 --> 01:54:50,579
people who have made an investment to a

2150
01:54:48,749 --> 01:54:52,440
structural form and people who are

2151
01:54:50,579 --> 01:54:54,329
considering an investment and it's

2152
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:56,820
difficult I acknowledge it's difficult

2153
01:54:54,329 --> 01:55:00,228
so the particular thing that I brought

2154
01:54:56,820 --> 01:55:03,150
up at the rrow was that we have a

2155
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:05,780
compellingly strong desire for

2156
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:08,429
multilingual representation of high

2157
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:10,499
volumes of the contact information we

2158
01:55:08,429 --> 01:55:12,869
have a specific and meaningful use case

2159
01:55:10,499 --> 01:55:15,389
that relates to the le.a and abuse

2160
01:55:12,869 --> 01:55:18,749
contact function and this is not over

2161
01:55:15,389 --> 01:55:20,999
field should be utf-8 so that it can be

2162
01:55:18,749 --> 01:55:21,889
a name in Swedish with diacriticals it

2163
01:55:20,999 --> 01:55:24,559
is we

2164
01:55:21,889 --> 01:55:28,729
they're to be the version of the field

2165
01:55:24,559 --> 01:55:32,989
in English and the version of the field

2166
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:35,269
in Croatian and we want that because it

2167
01:55:32,989 --> 01:55:37,159
empowers law enforcement behavior that's

2168
01:55:35,269 --> 01:55:39,709
based on this thing called mutual or

2169
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:41,959
assistance program em lab which is about

2170
01:55:39,709 --> 01:55:43,909
not having the FBI tried black

2171
01:55:41,959 --> 01:55:46,369
helicopter in country to deal with

2172
01:55:43,909 --> 01:55:49,249
criminal it's about having the FBI pick

2173
01:55:46,369 --> 01:55:51,289
up the phone and speak to a policeman in

2174
01:55:49,249 --> 01:55:53,889
Mongolia saying by this bad actor can

2175
01:55:51,289 --> 01:55:56,688
you speak to them and dual language

2176
01:55:53,889 --> 01:55:59,959
representation empowers the two actors

2177
01:55:56,689 --> 01:56:03,320
to talk sensibly about the data because

2178
01:55:59,959 --> 01:56:06,409
it respects the hint htdp of browser

2179
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:07,909
preference for language clearly we're

2180
01:56:06,409 --> 01:56:09,589
not going to have that we do 69

2181
01:56:07,909 --> 01:56:12,259
languages per record you're going to

2182
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:15,530
have local language and English the

2183
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:16,669
lingua franca and it's going to that is

2184
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:19,820
quite funny isn't it

2185
01:56:16,669 --> 01:56:23,360
and it's going to empower a circumstance

2186
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:26,449
so whilst I am here saying please can we

2187
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:29,089
consider a profile please can I ask you

2188
01:56:26,449 --> 01:56:31,999
to consider investment in analyzing is a

2189
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:33,590
profile viable and I understand I'm

2190
01:56:31,999 --> 01:56:35,570
asking you to we're cost

2191
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:37,579
and faced with the decision do I just

2192
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:39,648
say Jas contact and we're out of here or

2193
01:56:37,579 --> 01:56:42,049
do I invest in the assessment I am

2194
01:56:39,649 --> 01:56:44,599
asking you to wear a cost I would like

2195
01:56:42,050 --> 01:56:48,189
you to do that my stop line in this is

2196
01:56:44,599 --> 01:56:51,530
can you confirm that you can support a

2197
01:56:48,189 --> 01:56:53,719
dual language structure that is not the

2198
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:55,820
same as multilingual in the field

2199
01:56:53,719 --> 01:56:59,840
it's the representation of semantic

2200
01:56:55,820 --> 01:57:02,679
field States collections addresses in

2201
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:05,179
more than one language

2202
01:57:02,679 --> 01:57:08,300
just very quickly because I had cut off

2203
01:57:05,179 --> 01:57:10,130
the cue in running at a time so I'm

2204
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:12,889
happy to anyone about this after this is

2205
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:17,749
new again but they leave leave yes you

2206
01:57:12,889 --> 01:57:19,969
look at gets calendar of this similar

2207
01:57:17,749 --> 01:57:22,188
kind of spec it has an approach where

2208
01:57:19,969 --> 01:57:26,679
you can essentially you have a core

2209
01:57:22,189 --> 01:57:30,439
language for the object but you can so

2210
01:57:26,679 --> 01:57:31,729
pash per language so you can say each of

2211
01:57:30,439 --> 01:57:34,310
these things now in this language

2212
01:57:31,729 --> 01:57:35,720
it's these sorry

2213
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:38,690
it become cages here let's talk

2214
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:41,270
afterwards next time okay thanks

2215
01:57:38,690 --> 01:57:43,070
let's move on to the last discussion

2216
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:46,370
that we have here and Joseph I see you

2217
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:49,490
out there you want to jump into present

2218
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:50,750
mode here on the queue there you go you

2219
01:57:49,490 --> 01:57:52,519
should be able to unmute yourself and

2220
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:55,720
talk and I can do next slide for you and

2221
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:58,990
you're okay thanks Joe

2222
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:01,670
next slide this is the graph about the

2223
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:04,040
registration report definitions the

2224
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:05,780
problem we try to address is actually we

2225
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:08,390
did between registries and registrar's

2226
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:13,160
we do not share common formats to inform

2227
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:17,410
what specific paper reports cook should

2228
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:19,099
contain can contain trim and also

2229
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:22,460
component that we have multiple

2230
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:24,590
mechanisms of delivering a file the

2231
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:27,740
report right now ago we can actually

2232
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:29,930
using the same mechanisms to delivery

2233
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:35,780
not all of the reports but the reports

2234
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:39,160
definition file as well so next slide so

2235
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:42,740
the proposed is using JSON format and

2236
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:44,420
reach the reasons behind composing JSON

2237
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:48,080
is because reason formation is simple

2238
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:51,080
it's flexible is extendable I and the

2239
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:52,190
current mechanisms for report deliver is

2240
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:55,130
rest

2241
01:58:52,190 --> 01:59:00,080
HTTP and SFTP and JSON works well for

2242
01:58:55,130 --> 01:59:03,860
both if in future there's a desire for

2243
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:06,019
EPP a song can can converge through exam

2244
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:08,660
we offer a fairly straightforward but

2245
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:09,410
conversion to XML is not in scope for

2246
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:13,610
this draft

2247
01:59:09,410 --> 01:59:16,160
next slide so this is just one of the

2248
01:59:13,610 --> 01:59:18,670
exam one of the year the bare minimum

2249
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:21,800
examples of what the JSON file contains

2250
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:24,470
contains the difference names the report

2251
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:27,650
contains and what the carry is use and

2252
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:35,900
token Isis for for separation the file

2253
01:59:27,650 --> 01:59:39,349
value on an X so this one may be hard to

2254
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:42,019
repeat this one is I is also included in

2255
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:45,350
the draft this is just in expanded

2256
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:46,400
examples with what could be contained in

2257
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:48,980
the report

2258
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:51,530
definitions this example here contains

2259
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:53,929
more about steam the report naming

2260
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:56,420
format and about steam the report

2261
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:59,510
definition for stuff like versions and

2262
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:05,840
last time this definition files can

2263
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:07,910
update next fly and this is the snippet

2264
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:10,670
of examples about the the few

2265
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:13,760
definitions is this example here it

2266
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:17,050
talks about the name of the few what

2267
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:20,360
type of data ever been and examples like

2268
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:25,120
candy for you Allah give I use and this

2269
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:25,120
example is also in the draft next like

2270
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:32,780
so right now the drive have nothing need

2271
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:35,240
for IANA considerations but I'm trying

2272
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:36,830
to propose and would love to get more

2273
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:39,460
feedback of whether we would love to

2274
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:42,559
have a IANA registry that people

2275
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:47,180
particularly registries can submits

2276
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:51,230
their report definitions repository that

2277
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:54,380
could benefits registrar and maybe more

2278
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:58,250
people uniting FM public and mixed lie

2279
02:00:54,380 --> 02:01:02,990
and thank you would love to hear more

2280
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:04,750
people feedback about this trash okay

2281
02:01:02,990 --> 02:01:06,950
thank you

2282
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:10,130
one thing that is important to point out

2283
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:13,550
is we do already have and in our backlog

2284
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:18,020
a document data data set file format

2285
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:20,780
document so this is is an alternate

2286
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:23,990
along with that so at some point when we

2287
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:25,219
come to moving to this work item if we

2288
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:26,750
decide we're going to do it then

2289
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:29,300
obviously we would bring both of these

2290
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:30,790
documents up together so that we could

2291
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:34,280
go through them as a working group and

2292
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:35,510
see what we wanted to do and but Jim go

2293
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:38,450
ahead please yeah I just make one

2294
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:40,630
comment to Verisign yeah actually just I

2295
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:43,519
just reviewed it it looks very similar

2296
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:46,130
format so I think we're pretty much in

2297
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:48,320
line really there how maybe we'll do it

2298
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:51,620
in the case dataset file format it's an

2299
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:57,199
XML based approach with XML schema so I

2300
02:01:51,620 --> 02:02:01,340
think there's excellent

2301
02:01:57,199 --> 02:02:03,799
other comments or questions okay then

2302
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:06,619
thank you very much everyone we do have

2303
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:10,579
one last item on our agenda which is any

2304
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:13,699
other business but let me just you know

2305
02:02:10,579 --> 02:02:16,219
call for that here and otherwise we are

2306
02:02:13,699 --> 02:02:20,928
a couple of minutes over so I would say

2307
02:02:16,219 --> 02:02:22,340
the right thing to do here is probably

2308
02:02:20,929 --> 02:02:23,749
just say that we are done I don't see

2309
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:25,479
anyone jumping to the mic no one's in

2310
02:02:23,749 --> 02:02:27,800
the queue over here Thank You Joseph and

2311
02:02:25,479 --> 02:02:31,749
so we're adjourned folks thank you very

2312
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:31,749

2313
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:37,040
