I'm not very confident I can well he's

00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:40,889
on it you can put your name is in the

00:02:40,889 --> 00:03:59,280
okay okay end chatter morning okay

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:05,069
so I did not put you on the agenda are

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:09,359
you saying okay finding zoo before the

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:12,208
end of the video fast real quick so

9
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,579
instead of reading it are you guys okay

10
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,909
with the current agenda going once going

via diagram that somehow it thanks what

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,289
we're trying to accomplish here these

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,590
are actors by the architectural moment

and these are the entities that can take

00:06:50,590 --> 00:07:08,039
on best roles I find advice from a

relayed the diagram to the verifier in

bankrupt and in the ten- composition

47
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:30,850
because wherever in 2010 our list is we

48
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:30,849
have probable property remediation

49
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,699
this is a use case the most complicated

50
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:47,600
ones so they even find the mmm that's

deviations what we call so PVA ssin

55
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:06,260
until the tails okay and finally and

56
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:10,149
this is the first muscle to speak of the

57
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:24,740
rest architecture and the right back

58
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:35,510
options in there simple ones propagate

59
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:38,660
so other people in them and this is

60
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:41,360
captured in this sites upon the deep

61
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,689
session and we also have all the

62
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:51,110
instruments to eliminate one issues or

63
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:54,850
expand architecture itself so ladies is

64
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,850
this able starting point

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,399
alright so we've got a good enough so

66
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:18,579
now the question

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,579
yeah so terrified know if we should

68
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:50,110
that question on the table is I believe

69
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,110
that this craft is ready

70
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:59,420
can we have a draft which we don't have

71
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:04,040
right here but the architecture correct

72
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:07,490
is only the last document is there any

73
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,699
objection to they thought we meant as a

74
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:20,089
working document if you have an

75
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:21,800
objection to make side three so this is

76
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:26,120
where I just read whatever my concerns

77
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,979
about their pension graph right three

78
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,730
things

79
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:34,819
Laurence one would so the first one is

80
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,860
it is very syndrich about food trust

81
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:39,589
uses the word would address the point

82
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,639
where you cannot do anything really in

83
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:43,430
this heart connection without the

84
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,050
neutrals Adams nations need to be come

85
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:52,519
out of things like India where the apps

86
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:54,349
town windows okay so because this talk

87
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,880
gives us this very heart rate rather

88
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,440
than us blemish technician is just

89
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,779
pretty binary about frustrating it

90
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,029
pretty pretty nice there's a lot of

91
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,880
places where things are like birds

92
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,680
toughest customers doctors and I don't

93
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,149
think that's the right trim up for

94
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,719
attestation to know that the the

95
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:19,339
determination in the end should be

96
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,410
relative subjective The Situation's are

97
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,529
growing pretty well third is I still

98
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,620
find a lot of the next minute I'm clear

99
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:31,029
and hard to read actually an important

100
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,029
one is that don't think we understand

101
00:15:17,230 --> 00:16:24,920
in some scope okay and just one comment

102
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,139
for each person that's coming into the

103
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,540
mic with their list of issues against

104
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,790
the draft can be super helpful to have

105
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,800
them written down to know the details so

106
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,000
that you have a new session and a salute

107
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,490
them and the ciock we improve this draft

108
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,490
was another architecture director when

109
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,550
what we have to do to you know the glory

110
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,650
with it and the architecture intruders

111
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,479
we had waited for publishing

112
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,130
architecture directions that later on in

113
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,020
the process so could be a document that

114
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,090
hangs on for a while to before it goes

115
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,770
from final publication because our

116
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,920
intentions can evolve what's where it

117
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,720
starts great so that's an option as well

118
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,640
and even wants to talk to that you know

119
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,860
it evolve over time it becomes an

120
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,720
evolving - right so we get to the

121
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,629
question and the group decided that we

122
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,910
needed to recapture document and so much

123
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,890
like the process that we went to eat we

124
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,459
need an equals one to think there were

125
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:23,260
issues but the roots are very haunted

126
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:26,680
and with the condition that those issues

127
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,250
we can't resolve so you know we can

128
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:33,040
clarify that here or we can take that to

129
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,430
the discussion but I guess one of the

130
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,580
things that I would like to see is not

131
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:42,060
civilized process the less won't wait

132
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,520
until the use case abstract is perfect

133
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:49,240
to start on an architecture so all I was

134
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,240
trying to ask is to the groove is this

135
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,360
in other than a start from which we

136
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,540
start reading issues and concerns and

137
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,510
then we can get to an architecture graph

138
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:05,290
y1 parallel we're still working on the

139
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,360
actual solutions so I'm like everything

140
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,909
was this generally figure in

141
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,189
architecture and this is generally going

142
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:18,340
in the right direction right so the

143
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,460
question that I asked was is this

144
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:25,209
document sufficient enough for this

145
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,590
group to adopt as the seed so I think

146
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,250
that was the wording that you school

147
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,909
freshmen

148
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:38,530
well the green ability work on that too

149
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:40,830
so they have these things on this one

150
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,490
which is why braces

151
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:46,620
actually yeah oh yeah this is the best

152
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,399
starting point if there are some

153
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,389
observations that Tony made their person

154
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:53,370
is talking with an obviously I

155
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,850
understand the most part is the most

156
00:18:53,370 --> 00:19:00,860
important document MSN a good stage

157
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,860
there's a whole bunch for the document

158
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,970
filmography those aircraft the question

159
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,889
is often when working with adoptions

160
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:16,820
opportunist lockhart baby step out in

161
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:19,350
this change and so i think there's a

162
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:32,460
there's a bunch of other precious

163
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:35,939
document i've seen or not and so we this

164
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:42,200
racket and then is we didn't notice a

165
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,200
question of openness and then is in

166
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,799
pieces and

[Music]

171
00:21:00,919 --> 00:22:51,200
this one

172
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,750
[Music]

173
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,359

[Music]

175
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:36,110
and the end of the shoelace

176
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:56,800
okay okay I just try to make sure it

177
00:25:51,220 --> 00:26:30,370
gets to the nose just make sure the

178
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:35,710
Notre Dame has movies and okay so if we

179
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:38,679
can get feedback before we injury we'd

180
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:44,730
like to revisit this for a minute call

181
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,730
for adoption okay next so

182
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,420
[Applause]

183
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:42,320
this is so different

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,210
[Music]

[Music]

187
00:29:36,130 --> 00:30:55,930
in the suppression reading from the

188
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,870
homogeneous

189
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:22,399
it's actually useful and that way

190
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,799
creating a profile of grass and then use

191
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,289
this okay and so I don't know this

192
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,120
school I'm not convinced yet it's useful

193
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:31,700
to have a document that says information

194
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,500
about the Russians place okay I'd rather

195
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,029
have a document that says there's many

196
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,279
people information about reviews case

197
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:38,870
and then people go to profiles but then

198
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,320
you can't keep the vet say here's need

199
00:32:38,870 --> 00:33:02,090
to make some often or say case of

200
00:32:42,320 --> 00:33:04,149
excitation and I'm just trying to make

201
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,149
sure

202
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:15,229
segment people were standing in line and

203
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:18,349
olives say in the interest of time we're

204
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:20,389
going to get mama Kathleen parent wakes

205
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:23,689
up one of the things that I think we

206
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:26,839
have to focus on is the information

207
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,999
model at this point is a high level and

208
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:36,019
that's the score baby seasons we have

209
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:38,269
data model this law in Texas in the end

210
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:40,549
we have fewer data objects than we are

211
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:42,799
going to variations of the objects based

212
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:45,559
on the new space so if we don't find

213
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,479
some things that they all down to common

214
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,999
across some we're able to read a lady

215
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:53,119
information bottle at high level just

216
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:55,639
years it provides a basis for the DVP

217
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,439
options are going to be out there we

218
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:59,869
have to find something when we should

219
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:08,979
angle over there Asians that's why I'm a

220
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:08,978
mister vocabulary and female workers

221
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,619
suggestion so we're here anyway we just

222
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,959
have to explore this bit more between

223
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,539
two sets of copies that came up because

224
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:26,690
they were they're both reading books so

225
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:34,279
maybe there's middle ground or pensions

226
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:39,099
or so maybe above that just in terms of

227
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:39,099
you know us we release long term and

228
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:13,000
many initiatives said this seems to be

229
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:13,000
the most good of the most and I

230
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,230
consensus

231
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,340
[Music]

232
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,149
still applies in Joey percent of your

233
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,600
slides or you just want to get up in

234
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:33,010
five minutes

235
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:39,460
yeah you should my first slide

236
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:41,860
yeah so these slides will made like

237
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,580
forever ago before I had a lot of side

238
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,080
conversations and I've learned a lot of

239
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:57,630
these were changed quite a bit quite

240
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:57,630
remember since then so my place to

241
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:14,919
describe each claim in text then

242
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:17,649
describe Greeks or the guys see the

243
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:22,060
second three have see description of

244
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:28,690
each claim and with the relay between

245
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:34,240
their attack right so section three

246
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:39,070
house nutrition of each claim each

247
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:42,549
flight and then support strategy a

248
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:45,670
general way to circulated staffing to

249
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,680
either C or R Jason so really when I was

250
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,060
after here whether you'd call an

251
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,910
information in a lot or whatever you

252
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:57,370
wanna call it is the description is

253
00:36:51,910 --> 00:37:01,990
neutral to the serialization and then

254
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:08,040
have some procedural describe way that

255
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:12,009
that turns into the Jason Segel so I

256
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,290
think technically section 3 both

257
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:21,070
information on data model and sucky port

258
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:23,259
is representation so this is an example

259
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,060
of why anyone in here so this is

260
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,580
this is the description of the start of

261
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:32,080
the distribution for basically this up

262
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:37,090
for yesterday for your CDL it's ready

263
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:39,700
the location and then we're got specific

264
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:54,460
I have to do labels because lately

265
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:58,120
Jason's so okay so here bone this is one

266
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:02,170
of my own compositions is I think it's

267
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:06,029
really interesting to distinguish the

268
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:09,570
description of the claims where city

269
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:17,500
center consent they were less

270
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:20,680
interaction model exchange because the

271
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:25,110
yang dr. blank James is actually going

272
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:31,560
into a whole substantial stage of work

273
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:34,140
that's called a plan by DG immunity so

274
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:42,250
[Music]

275
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:50,950
what my conversation got today you know

276
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:53,560
it's kind of the G or use it as ppm

277
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:56,040
isn't and eat are the additions in the

278
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,040
nights over

279
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,160
so go number one part of the ethos all

280
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,890
the industry work is in claims

281
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,859
definition sign up for math we picked

282
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:14,920
the modern one and then transport the

283
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:19,060
pork off this is anything you want no

284
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,310
constraint that right in the TPM TCG

285
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,710
world the claims are locked down just

286
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,299
because TPM devices only cite certain

287
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,460
things

288
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,500
and actions of things but in the end the

289
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,930
truth instead of the back side inform

290
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,240
activists lockdown it has to be but the

291
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:36,750
PM's dude can't be because they arose a

292
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,640
but there isn't working right so that's

293
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,640
managed meaning looking any model any

294
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:50,220
the inputs do it again duster so very

295
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:52,890
different from what each side there's a

296
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,709
record one which is where the plane

297
00:39:52,890 --> 00:40:00,390
underneath it work again because someone

298
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:03,230
to open-ended somebody's I think I might

299
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:06,450
have locked them as x.509 certificates

300
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:14,400
in the Transfer Protocol is locked

301
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:20,250
empathic because so many of these three

302
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:24,390
flavors okay so my proposal here is that

303
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:29,370
we split the information model state

304
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:32,310
information house probably to one of it

305
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:34,859
is or even write of mine claims so we

306
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,620
have to be an information well the

307
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:41,220
finest claims and we used a similar

308
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:47,670
technique yeah just do three like them

309
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:49,230
and that suits most of the work but it's

310
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,650
not necessary to keep getting worked up

311
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:54,450
so much because you know my lockdown we

312
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,940
have suffered miserably she's model to

313
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,520
the interaction some of the information

314
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:03,870
for the interaction parts which is

315
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:15,390
really what you got the anchor and to

316
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:19,279
see work implementation is dissipated in

317
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:24,240
this conversation it would be more

318
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:33,060
discussion and so we do that so we're

319
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:35,990
going to restart that now so we thought

320
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:39,799
we would try to and

321
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:43,069
scope the discussion a little bit

322
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,069
nominal slides

323
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,290
[Music]

324
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:20,119
okay so this is just this ugly context

325
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:20,119
what we want to do is the contracts

326
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:29,609
forward with information model yeah some

327
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:34,319
of the decisions that we make are first

328
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:36,000
with the understand what content belong

329
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,060
to the information model that's sort of

330
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,210
one factor think about the other one is

331
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,578
is how do we represent the information

332
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:49,230
model in terms of the drafts that are

333
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:52,160
provided so it's a question of multiple

334
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:55,260
drafts and move your out that's really

335
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,379
key keep those two in line they give you

336
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:01,020
separate conversations but over the two

337
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,440
kinds of questions that we have them

338
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:09,000
today way we want to also remind folks

339
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:13,020
that are chartered that's an information

340
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,579
model so provided here's any dates that

341
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,700
we do a little bit find an information

342
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:24,810
model and then we also define a data

343
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:26,759
model okay and we're also want folks to

344
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,859
understand that there's an RFC defines

345
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,869
the difference between the two we

346
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:33,930
summarized in one sentence what the

347
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:36,960
difference is you can read them but we

348
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:39,618
really want to leave working group to be

349
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,619
very familiar with that that arc see

350
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,619
understand

351
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:52,290
so if we look at a working group charter

352
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,540
the text in the Charter says uses the

353
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:57,660
words assertions and ratnam claims as

354
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,790
well as system characteristics those but

355
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:03,259
those are the words that are used this

356
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:06,869
code what we wanted for my sake for rats

357
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:09,420
okay now granted we still may need to

358
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:11,819
refine the definition of those terms but

359
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,540
it isn't that is it isn't supposed to be

360
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:17,520
very widely bright we're not here thank

361
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,230
you general information laws that's the

362
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:25,349
point we're trying to frame the

363
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:29,970
discussion in the context of rice okay

364
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:32,480
so we basically have two drafts that are

365
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:37,980
defining information models currently

366
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:41,040
there's the the draft or cold strats

367
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,319
information model 0 0 it basically

368
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,849
contains two kinds of information meta

369
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,359
characteristics that applies to

370
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:50,670
assertions and also appliances 7

371
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:53,549
surgeons we also use the word claim as

372
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,380
synopsis of assertion so it's a two

373
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:59,130
kinds of information medical or the

374
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:02,160
draft currently in the draft ITI brats

375
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:05,849
eat a one it defines both information

376
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:10,259
model data model and it contains

377
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:12,569
information such as surgeons and how to

378
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:17,849
group them it also talks about how to

379
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:20,759
nest groups of assertions and so there's

380
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:22,500
they're not exactly you know a Venn

381
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,589
diagram there's some overlap but not a

382
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:29,730
lot of overlap but those tend to be the

383
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:32,339
kinds of content that are being

384
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:36,510
described currently so surgeons grouping

385
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:38,310
nesting interactions and Medicare

386
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,770
prisoners there may be something else

387
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:43,310
that we haven't yet you know discussed

388
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:46,200
maybe we use a perfect brush to discuss

389
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:50,578
but hopefully didn't bring that out for

390
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:53,368
context of our discussion so with that I

391
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,500
think we want to open the mind to those

392
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:56,510
two

393
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:05,780
especially these son where we should go

394
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:08,359
forward Monday evening one so I'm one of

395
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,150
the team authors and I've been working

396
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:14,960
on what should be the format for a

397
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:18,410
station that you spent time looking at

398
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,990
the suit work at that time looking at

399
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:23,960
these and looking at some of our

400
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:31,098
specific things from Intel I've been

401
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:34,700
looking at least manifestations and I

402
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:39,109
will lighten the format I see that more

403
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,240
as a data model rather than and I'd like

404
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:45,500
to see something more along the lines of

405
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,899
the student manifest work where it

406
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,170
describes a CDL that says this is a

407
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,240
format of an attestation and it says

408
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,190
these other data elements these are how

409
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,979
they're nested this is how you extended

410
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:01,700
it and in the client specific elements

411
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:04,970
that use gravity in the attestation code

412
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,399
and so some of that my computation area

413
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:09,348
this is how we are back this is how we

414
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,230
put in a hatch this is how you have a

415
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:14,330
feeling this is how you have reached and

416
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:17,810
that becomes our information model and

417
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:20,480
then data models like the heat W and

418
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:24,770
then say here's a specific mapping onto

419
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:33,070
the information model here's and I can

420
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:36,050
do a data model for the secure element

421
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:39,890
at someone right you can come together

422
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:43,750
like my hand said we have a few of these

423
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:46,848
define we can find a partner and

424
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:51,830
hopefully that will create a way for us

425
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:54,619
to say regional sector my goal through

426
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:56,990
this is one I want to make sure that

427
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:01,070
manufacturers like my company have the

428
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:03,830
ability to extend the data model if they

429
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:06,160
feel they need to but I don't want to

430
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,160
create

431
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:49,330
so we follow the information information

432
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:52,540
world and whatever we like nothing to

433
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:55,660
lose here this X people describe meta

434
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:59,140
characteristics on the slide so what you

435
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:03,220
can always have this discrete items that

436
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:05,410
are semantically rectifying papers is

437
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,290
operability here's what taxonomy there

438
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:11,049
so have this meta items that that group

439
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:13,320
them and whatever we do you should never

440
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,520
forget that at least very well that goes

441
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,770
if anyone's supposed to be go

442
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,610
this system also somewhere this cannot

443
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:21,190
just be dropped

444
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:24,340
it wasn't my only may only be concerned

445
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:26,560
that that might be a few somehow these

446
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,530
categories of information elements that

447
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:32,770
say this is about extrinsic intrinsic

448
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:36,010
factor software some movies or protocol

449
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:38,290
parameter that is highly important for

450
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:42,610
later people to understand better

451
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:46,600
look when I must remind everybody that

452
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:49,360
need the turn instructs us that our

453
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:54,750
information models are informed by these

454
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:57,880
pieces so we expect that is we in the

455
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:59,470
characteristics are harder that are

456
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,640
those models that they are these

457
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:06,069
motivated by a space inside and I have

458
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,190
someone who declare define in summer X

459
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,940
which is seven eight correctly you're

460
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:14,300
saying regardless

461
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,369
how we define the individual elements of

462
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,700
an information model we also need to

463
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:22,700
talk instruction either be grouping this

464
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:25,310
versus categorizations versus fights

465
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:28,220
you're advocating to there needs to be

466
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,980
someone with structure and guidance in

467
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:36,589
that structure as well this I just want

468
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:38,829
to chew Meccans captured Thank You Nikki

469
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:41,119
so online also suggests that maybe we

470
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:44,420
instead of looking at these documents

471
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:50,599
listed here actress after they share all

472
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:54,920
these cases for capture they're so so

473
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:56,900
again to my earlier comment I fight for

474
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,170
us to see if there's a way in which we

475
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:03,020
can paralyze some of the efforts because

476
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:06,050
to put in case in point - let's wait

477
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:08,240
until we have all the use cases making

478
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:16,250
the death of this group or at least this

479
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:36,379
particular chair is that we drop these

480
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:40,990
and more of these structure yes

481
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,990
we structure requirements visualize

482
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,389
[Music]

483
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:12,529
containing or is it none of them is just

484
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,270
the structure I think that's a question

485
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,760
that would like the working that to come

486
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:19,670
to consensus on because the wider you

487
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:23,130
get the less confident I am so you start

488
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:26,910
you stole our line so the intent here is

489
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:29,160
and again I come back to we are going to

490
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:31,499
be guided by the use cases which is why

491
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,348
the Charter said we will list the use

492
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:36,299
cases to tell us the requirements then

493
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:38,249
it will be up to the group based on

494
00:52:36,299 --> 00:52:41,099
those requirements do we choose to say

495
00:52:38,249 --> 00:52:44,220
this is a minimal set or do we make them

496
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:46,799
optional so met try to capture that in

497
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:50,549
the this is how we leave the discussions

498
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:53,729
but thank you this is all intertwined if

499
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:57,930
you will in how we need to move forward

500
00:52:53,729 --> 00:53:01,200
yeah so my point there is about what you

501
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:02,848
need an information model for means when

502
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,710
you eat one right because the next time

503
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:06,660
somebody comes along and wants to add an

504
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,979
assertion by adding asking Ayane or

505
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,328
whatever are you gonna say sorry you

506
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:11,819
can't until you give us an information

507
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:13,559
model and hopefully the answer is no

508
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,970
that's not the intent right so that's

509
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,759
what I was getting at by saying I think

510
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:20,098
it is useful to have a document that

511
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:21,630
says here are patterns and structures an

512
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,400
example of patterns right if you're

513
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:25,170
defining a new information model if

514
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,869
you're it's going to be lets say a

515
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,869
numeric one here's how to define it in

516
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:32,640
such a way as it can be represented in

517
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:33,839
JWT and CWT and so on because there's a

518
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,759
mapping here so you don't have to

519
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,288
specify that so it becomes a lot easier

520
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:38,789
so you don't need a new information

521
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:39,539
model because all the mapping work is

522
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:41,609
done for you

523
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:42,809
so something that specifies mappings but

524
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:45,390
that you can do that without specifying

525
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:46,710
claims right and so so far I strongly

526
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,319
support everything that is clean

527
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:51,450
agnostic whether we need the actual

528
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:55,109
claims in the document I am less sure

529
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:56,759
about okay maybe maybe not but what we

530
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:58,140
do need is a way to map because one of

531
00:53:56,759 --> 00:54:00,989
the main points of an information model

532
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,819
is to allow you to easily have multiple

533
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:04,890
formats and potentially even met between

534
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:07,319
them in an intermediary or support both

535
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,868
of them say in any protocol entities

536
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:11,880
right so were you speaking as an

537
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:14,400
individual because I know this is all as

538
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,229
an individual and winter Microsoft

539
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,609
implementation employee whatever you

540
00:54:16,229 --> 00:54:19,410
want to call it ya know the reason why

541
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:23,640
I'm mentioning that and I will mention

542
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:27,029
this as co-chair yeah we so I will speak

543
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,538
as team co-chair sorry we had

544
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:35,210
discussions there as we're building

545
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:36,559
dependencies in teep for leveraging the

546
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,779
LLC

547
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,499
sure for now and one of the discussions

548
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:44,269
which I don't want to open up here

549
00:54:41,499 --> 00:54:46,399
but we eventually have to have that

550
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:50,529
discussion and that goes to the IANA

551
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,809
structure and to Dave's comment and Oh

552
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:56,989
Dave wheeler and Dave Taylor and they're

553
00:54:53,809 --> 00:55:00,880
both cities I can't even for dealers but

554
00:54:56,989 --> 00:55:04,039
by both Dave Taylor and Dave wheeler is

555
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,869
providing enough guidance so that we

556
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:08,749
don't become the bottleneck for

557
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:10,939
potentially other groups that may want

558
00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:14,089
to come and define a new set of

559
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:18,499
assertions so I just want to leave it

560
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:23,420
there and now I'm taking the teeth so

561
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:26,448
I'm primarily focused on definition of

562
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:29,809
claims of definition of assertions I

563
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:31,910
think every I mean I think that's the

564
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:33,019
interesting work to figure out what what

565
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:35,598
assertions and claims we're going to

566
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:37,640
have and write them out and make them

567
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,179
really clear and pretty and so

568
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:45,949
understand how they should be currently

569
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:47,869
with the the eat draft it puts all the

570
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:53,479
the information about a particular claim

571
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:55,309
in one place I I'm not sure I what I

572
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:59,299
understand about the the information

573
00:55:55,309 --> 00:56:01,219
model because it takes like half the

574
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:05,660
text from the eighth draft and puts it

575
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:11,900
into the information model so to me it

576
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:16,959
would be a disaster I'm wishing so so to

577
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,959
me so this is an important point for me

578
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:28,549
I'm sorry we're caucusing yeah so I want

579
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:31,640
you to understand this so the the the

580
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:34,519
the the definition of a claim can't be

581
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:37,400
forked between two drafts that's two

582
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,718
documents that would be a disaster so if

583
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,420
you're going to describe the location

584
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:47,239
claim or the boot state claim it needs

585
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:48,920
to be in one place so if it that's

586
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:50,480
probably the most critical most

587
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,390
important thing for me

588
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,670
and the way the current information

589
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,759
model draft looks is it looks like it

590
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:00,740
wants to split that so half of the half

591
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,300
of the description of the location claim

592
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:04,899
would be in the information model and

593
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,859
the other half would be in the eat

594
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,079
document and then maybe in the yang

595
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:10,640
document - I don't know I don't

596
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:12,290
understand the vision for that but

597
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,810
that's the thing that's critical for me

598
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:17,270
is that the definition of a claim in a

599
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:20,359
coherent comprehensive is in one

600
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:23,270
document so just to clarify when you say

601
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:24,950
the definition of a claim so there's

602
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,710
been comments about the information

603
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:30,799
model providing the structure for what

604
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:34,220
an assertion or claim may look like not

605
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,349
a specific instantiation of a claim or

606
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,899
an assertion okay so are you saying

607
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:42,109
those two should be bound to the same

608
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:44,930
document if you're doing like yeah I

609
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:46,279
think I I don't I don't understand that

610
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:48,259
it sounds like a little bit like

611
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:52,880
defining types and principles for

612
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:54,680
defining clients think of it as as like

613
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,839
the programming language and I'll let

614
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,390
Dave Miller come and speak as well but I

615
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:03,078
think of it as you've created a base

616
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:05,629
sorry I'm a C++ coder so you create a

617
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:09,380
base object from which you can

618
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:13,099
instantiate specific object classes from

619
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,750
that base object yeah I need a more

620
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:16,250
specific example to understand where

621
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:19,339
you're going with that so this is Dave

622
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,530
really so I hunted percent agree with

623
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:25,279
you we can't split claims between

624
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:27,680
documents I will stand back-to-back with

625
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:34,940
you and fight to the end we can't do

626
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:37,520
that okay I can't hear what he said

627
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:40,400
I said that I'd fight back-to-back with

628
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,069
Lawrence we can't split claims between

629
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,839
two documents but I think perhaps I

630
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:46,970
didn't speak clearly enough about the

631
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:50,900
information model the the information

632
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:54,319
model defines a structure and it defines

633
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:57,500
data types and talks about how those

634
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:01,640
data types are are formatted and and

635
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:03,860
could potentially be used so I I would

636
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:06,500
have CD VL that says oh I

637
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,840
the structure I've got this header and

638
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:11,420
then I can have claims and claims look

639
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:14,240
like this and they can have versions and

640
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:16,370
this and if you do a hash if you want to

641
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,649
define a hash it should be defined this

642
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:20,960
way and here's a way to do it in JSON

643
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:23,450
and here's a way to do it in in seaboard

644
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,850
so that's an information model and we

645
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:28,189
can point to other instances of that but

646
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:30,440
it's just an information model and then

647
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:36,070
when we go say ok I want to define a

648
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:38,240
claim for at EEE this is this is now a

649
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:40,760
document model that uses the information

650
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,299
model and says ok there's a structure

651
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:47,120
I'm going to define what an attestation

652
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:49,190
token looks for this and use the

653
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,350
information model and the common defined

654
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:53,660
elements to say this is what this is

655
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:56,120
what a claim looks like and if I'm doing

656
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:58,190
a boot claim it has it needs to have

657
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,799
these elements these are mandatory these

658
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:03,200
are optional I draw from the information

659
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,180
models say that's the format and I use

660
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,200
the structure from the information okay

661
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:11,330
so logistical e because again I want to

662
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,669
come back and and kind of sort of but

663
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:16,549
really be black and white so just so you

664
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:21,530
guys know I'm gonna cut the line at Ming

665
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:25,070
Ming is on the jabber okay all right me

666
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:25,460
deco Kevin confused so again to be black

667
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:29,120
and white

668
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:32,030
my initial question and preferably yes

669
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,950
or no right is that you and Lawrence

670
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:37,910
since you are agreeing to the death

671
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:40,040
whatever that means right is what I was

672
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:42,680
trying to make the distinction is that

673
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,660
the information model defines the

674
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,230
structure of what a cream might look

675
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,350
like

676
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:50,600
it doesn't necessarily instantiate it

677
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:53,180
doesn't have to a can but it doesn't

678
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,790
necessarily instantiate this is a

679
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,339
geolocation claim to me that's an

680
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:03,890
instance that can be in a separate

681
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:07,700
document is so so Dave wheeler is

682
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:10,460
nodding yes Lawrence yes or no I'm

683
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,319
pretty sure I'm yes I mean it's not per

684
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,820
se precisely enough for me not to know

685
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,470
for sure

686
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,420
I think we're in your interest of time

687
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:20,629
we only have two or three minutes left

688
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:23,270
please yeah I think we're actually

689
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:25,340
already doing this because we're there's

690
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:27,830
some types for deferring zand dates

691
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,540
already in that GWT and CW t and then

692
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:31,910
we're referencing them from anytime and

693
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:33,860
so that's why men was trying to

694
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:37,250
structure it too there's some elements

695
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:41,840
of an information model in eat but it's

696
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:45,380
not complete the Burke Holt draft has a

697
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:49,430
different explanation and description

698
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:53,150
but anyway sorry I shouldn't be answered

699
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:55,940
that we should just continue yeah I mean

700
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:58,100
this is basically the only way concerned

701
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,690
with the rats information model document

702
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,930
is it seems like it's only a little bit

703
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:04,880
of the it's like only a fragment of this

704
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:07,040
is why we're opening we're not doing any

705
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,080
call for adoption we want to get

706
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,080
guidance for the group on the direction

707
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:17,630
and and I expect everybody to provide

708
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:19,310
their comments for those especially who

709
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:23,210
are shy and don't want to come to the

710
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:27,080
MEC to put them on the list okay I heard

711
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:29,660
that I'm not sure what Nancy means when

712
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:32,720
she says what the structure looks like

713
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:36,170
is there content in there is a semantic

714
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,700
text in the structure or is it not it

715
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:40,700
can have semantics so that is

716
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:43,069
interesting because it didn't I didn't

717
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:46,580
hear that from the text so I would find

718
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:49,100
it drastically the disastrous if we

719
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:52,790
split information model elements all

720
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:54,650
across the data model documents and have

721
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:57,290
them there and I give you a good example

722
01:02:54,650 --> 01:03:02,480
because then we would define nons four

723
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:04,550
times why why not define it at a central

724
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,680
point and just refer to it and say and

725
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:09,310
I'm and my data model Ananse is

726
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:12,200
represented in this way data moral wise

727
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:14,660
it makes absolutely no sense to me to

728
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,029
redefine this all over again and that is

729
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:19,310
why I'm sorry fighting against you back

730
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:22,480
to back because that makes no sense at

731
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:22,480
all to my W

732
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:29,300
okay we need to keep moving forward

733
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:33,730
because we have somebody on me TECA so

734
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:35,750
may your on the commute

735
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:40,190
okay can you hear us

736
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:42,890
hi yes I tried to see can you hear me

737
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:45,620
yes oh great

738
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:48,470
okay so just for fun so just a couple of

739
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:50,180
comments on mines on the information

740
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:52,549
model where's a climber first one I

741
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:54,440
agree with different wheeler and other

742
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,950
said information Martin to me said

743
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,840
worried

744
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:59,600
come on for my retard define just

745
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:02,830
structure types and saw the claims are

746
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,210
really relevant to the specific domain I

747
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:08,779
we might have have some common claims

748
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:11,900
taken locations on identifiers but I was

749
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:14,330
it should be extensible of different

750
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:17,810
workgroup and a different domain defined

751
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:20,049
the own claims so what you you mean that

752
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:22,880
I ain't I would take over that or I was

753
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:25,910
considering we may have a separate

754
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,850
document for separate domain a claims

755
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:32,149
for example team may have a say called

756
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:34,299
claims the document formally in the same

757
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:37,130
information model the structure types

758
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:40,190
for example like a tea claim a party

759
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:42,230
that t8 terminology not appear currently

760
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:44,300
80 and Carnegie information model

761
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:48,200
trapped I see right so we'll make some

762
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:50,750
claim what immunity is Russian vendor or

763
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,649
saw deformation so that will become a

764
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:57,500
claim statement in some document so

765
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:59,270
attitude then then next question is how

766
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,820
do we know all claims

767
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:04,940
you said model right you very model

768
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:07,700
consists on shall we have a registry

769
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:10,790
somewhere in this workgroup arts is that

770
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,830
or go to IANA so that's a open question

771
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:15,410
I'd like to ask but if a claim that in

772
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:18,319
my comments are thinking aloud which is

773
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:20,359
extension it's a for different time and

774
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:25,130
we can't define its own set of a clamps

775
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:27,410
we intercept a talk okay with with that

776
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:33,650
we're out of time so I'm gonna let Ned

777
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:37,129
wrap up and while he's doing the closing

778
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:40,400
guy in jest and I'll practice

779
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:43,070
all right so so just to summarize we're

780
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,050
really driving for making making some

781
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,430
decisions what we're gonna do is publish

782
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:48,970
these on the list so that we can

783
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:51,259
encourage continued feedback and comment

784
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:53,359
but these are essentially the questions

785
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:55,220
that we want to want to ask and have the

786
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,010
working group find answers for which is

787
01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:00,049
in terms of an information model is it a

788
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:02,660
are we driving toward the standalone

789
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:04,760
draft are we driving for something

790
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:06,740
that's merged into an architecture draft

791
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,050
is it something that's merged into the

792
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:10,819
eat draft or is it something else

793
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:13,280
entirely we had some discussion about

794
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:15,980
whether it should be distributed across

795
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,470
multiple drafts or not these are all

796
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:21,560
really important questions I think what

797
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:24,140
I also heard on the discussion was hey

798
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,970
there's something like domains or some

799
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,500
some sort of context in which we think

800
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:30,160
that there's a need to support some

801
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:34,760
extensibility in terms of the types of

802
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:37,040
claims that can be expressed we also

803
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,050
heard that there's a need to have some

804
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:42,770
structure and pattern that's common

805
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:44,360
across everything that's that that

806
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:46,520
captures some of these other concepts

807
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:49,460
like you know how things are grouped how

808
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,900
they're nested that sort of thing so we

809
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:53,120
want to continue this discussion the

810
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:56,090
intent for today was to just open the

811
01:06:53,120 --> 01:07:29,540
discussion we want to try and continue

812
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:34,400
this until we and we have to get to yes

813
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:37,120
you have a funky for many because I did

814
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:46,370
five clicks

815
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:47,270
if the clicker works oh okay well that's

816
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:50,558
gonna be a challenge

817
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:55,160
well no no no that's fine

818
01:07:50,559 --> 01:08:01,010
right this full-screen we did this

819
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:03,828
fullscreen doesn't work as I said okay

820
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:06,680
see that that is the fullscreen

821
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,700
according to the crew so I found the

822
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:14,770
magic trick

823
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:14,770
there you see two clicks okay great okay

824
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:23,929
okay my name is guy Federico with

825
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:26,870
juniper Networks Jessica and I have been

826
01:08:23,929 --> 01:08:30,940
working on this software integrity

827
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:34,399
verification stuff at TCG for some time

828
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:37,460
and what I wanted to do with this draft

829
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:41,149
and this presentation is to help people

830
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:46,189
see what it is that TCG TPM attestation

831
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:48,198
means and how start to work on how we

832
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:50,120
can link that with all of the other

833
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:55,278
kinds of a decision that are being

834
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:59,089
discussed here in rats the work of

835
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:01,910
course is described in the draft but

836
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:06,170
there's also a document on the TCG

837
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:10,339
website which gives a more or less the

838
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:13,160
same thing in a in a different format

839
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:18,109
with like colors and pictures and stuff

840
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:20,120
if that's of interest to anyone and that

841
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:23,870
document if from TCG's point of view is

842
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:25,399
out for public review at this point okay

843
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:29,149
so what I'll do is talk a little bit

844
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:33,318
about what what we see as at a station

845
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:36,738
at TCG and then we'll go into some of

846
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:39,799
the documents the the problem statement

847
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:42,858
is actually kind of straightforward we

848
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:45,670
would like to know whether the software

849
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:48,410
running on a particular device is

850
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:50,390
authentic software by whoever's

851
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:52,790
definition they want whatever software

852
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:54,620
was put there that that's what is there

853
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:59,840
and it hasn't been hacked when the thing

854
01:09:54,620 --> 01:10:02,630
boots we can do this using a measured

855
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:05,330
boot process and we use the TPM

856
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:11,630
a way to store the results and report

857
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:14,420
the results and sign the results what we

858
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:16,969
need to do is define the rest of the

859
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:21,020
workflow that goes around it the the ppm

860
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:25,730
part is has been done and stable and

861
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:27,739
frozen for some time but the protocol

862
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:31,370
part has not and that's the part we want

863
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:35,809
to work on here and of course as we do

864
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:37,969
this the protocol work should be the

865
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:40,340
workflow should be extensible enough to

866
01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:42,560
fit with other use cases other

867
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:47,239
applications in that of course what the

868
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:51,850
rats charter calls for I will say the

869
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:58,370
last bullet here is an important one the

870
01:10:51,850 --> 01:11:00,409
the way a DPM works is defined and we

871
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:03,620
need to retain compatibility with that

872
01:11:00,409 --> 01:11:06,320
there are many of them out there so that

873
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:11,449
that puts some constraints on what we

874
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:14,540
what we can do just to back up a step as

875
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:20,570
to what this all means measured boot in

876
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:23,330
this world means that a device might

877
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:26,469
I'll say router all the time because

878
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:29,929
I've worked for a router company device

879
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:33,159
would have an operating system software

880
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:36,800
a processor of some sort and also a ppm

881
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:40,040
as the thing boots each stage of the

882
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,560
boot measures just takes a hash whatever

883
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:45,530
it's going to run next and stores that

884
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:48,949
ash in the TPM there are bazillion

885
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:50,540
details that go with that Fudd but

886
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:52,669
essentially that's what happens if he

887
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:56,840
PM's job is to receive those hashes and

888
01:11:52,670 --> 01:12:00,199
guard them so they can't be hacked later

889
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:03,650
a verifier and come along and say to the

890
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:05,780
TPM hey what did you get and there's a

891
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:09,019
little more information that goes along

892
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:12,739
with that in both directions but the TPM

893
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:15,500
job then is to report the boot state

894
01:12:12,739 --> 01:12:16,289
that it received or the current state as

895
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,459
it as it

896
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:25,049
as as the system has come up and it

897
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:28,049
signs it and an important part as I've

898
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:30,809
learned in talking to a number of our

899
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:33,629
colleagues here is there is an implicit

900
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:35,639
trust model here which I have not

901
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:38,369
explained but we'll go through in the

902
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:41,519
next draft of this stuff and boy it'd be

903
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:43,739
nice to not break the trust model it

904
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:45,899
doesn't say everyone has to use the TCD

905
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:50,549
trust model but whatever comes out of

906
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:54,569
rats could we please not break the trust

907
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:58,280
model that's that works here okay so

908
01:12:54,569 --> 01:13:01,139
that we're trying to get done

909
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:04,949
information flows in the broad sense

910
01:13:01,139 --> 01:13:07,199
we'll look at this again but there's a

911
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:09,688
source for software which might be the

912
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:11,579
device manufacturer although it could be

913
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:14,369
someone else

914
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:18,259
there's the device that we are at

915
01:13:14,369 --> 01:13:20,848
testing there's the verifier the

916
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,589
information on from the device

917
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:25,289
manufacturer should go to the verifier

918
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:27,629
so it knows what to look for then the

919
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:31,409
verifier asks the question to say who

920
01:13:27,629 --> 01:13:35,068
are you and what do you have and the

921
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:38,358
device returns the responses I should

922
01:13:35,069 --> 01:13:41,369
say in ppm speak a quote is the

923
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:44,039
technical term or the lot of data that

924
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:51,959
the TEM responds with to say here's my

925
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:56,818
current state why is this hard maybe it

926
01:13:51,959 --> 01:14:00,949
isn't but one part of it at least for

927
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:00,949
what we do in the router business is

928
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:05,818
telling whether you're running the right

929
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:07,559
software doesn't matter much unless you

930
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:09,329
know you're asking the right router

931
01:14:07,559 --> 01:14:11,549
you're not going to put your hands on

932
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:14,030
the thing it's you're off in the ether

933
01:14:11,549 --> 01:14:18,209
somewhere there's some device out there

934
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:21,358
there have been a number of embarrassing

935
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:23,249
circumstances that got summarized

936
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:26,849
through a thing called the a Zygon

937
01:14:23,249 --> 01:14:29,969
attack oh I'm supposed to stand on the

938
01:14:26,849 --> 01:14:35,849
red X yes oh

939
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:38,280
Wow okay yes so we're essentially a

940
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:40,050
man-in-the-middle attack could separate

941
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,300
the identity of the device from the

942
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:44,190
state of the device so the broken device

943
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,030
could get a good device to respond on

944
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:48,178
its behalf

945
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:51,030
don't want to have that happen this

946
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:56,400
problem is is pretty much multi-vendor

947
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:58,590
because whoever verifies the answer and

948
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,509
whoever produces the Rosi it produces

949
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:02,729
the result it probably not the same

950
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:07,050
vendor at least they shouldn't

951
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:09,449
necessarily be the same it's a little

952
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:13,409
challenging because for complicated

953
01:15:09,449 --> 01:15:16,049
things like routers there are a lot of

954
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:17,549
software configurations and determining

955
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:19,619
whether this one is a good one or not is

956
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:22,260
a little harder than just this ash

957
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:25,710
equals something I don't know maybe

958
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:30,170
someone who makes IOT thermostats can

959
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:34,800
say this is a hash good but routers are

960
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:37,739
wicked complicated okay so if we look at

961
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:43,639
this in a protocol closer to the

962
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:43,638
protocol levels then same picture but

963
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:54,090
you know a couple of different flows

964
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:57,268
where we need to we need to first

965
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:58,979
identify verify the identity in this

966
01:15:57,269 --> 01:16:02,519
work we're using we're leveraging the I

967
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:06,179
Triple E dev ID stuff and use the key

968
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:10,199
which is in the TPM to verify the TLS

969
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:11,460
connection and having verified the

970
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:14,219
connection that we have the right device

971
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:17,909
then we can go ahead with the next stage

972
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:19,769
of asking for quotes so that we can then

973
01:16:17,909 --> 01:16:22,379
verify that whatever is on the box is

974
01:16:19,769 --> 01:16:23,820
what we thought was going to be there we

975
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:26,820
also of course need the reference

976
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:29,429
measurements there are two ways to do

977
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:33,179
this depending on how you think about

978
01:16:29,429 --> 01:16:37,619
your structuring your back-end systems

979
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:39,840
and and the application either the

980
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:41,940
verifier goes to the device manufacturer

981
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,810
directly or the software manufacturer to

982
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:47,099
obtain the

983
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:49,050
Goldin measurements or the software

984
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,820
vendors ships the golden measurements

985
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:53,160
which are signed by the software vendor

986
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,799
along with the software so that you can

987
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:58,710
go to the box say tell me what you

988
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,950
should have tell me what you do have and

989
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,630
work on the comparison and since the

990
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,580
measurements are signed by the vendor

991
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:08,310
and trust model you can figure out

992
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:10,019
whether it's what you think should be

993
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:12,510
there and whether it looks like it's

994
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:15,360
right so those are the those are the

995
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:22,040
flows that we want to be able to do with

996
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:24,719
this to support within TCG we've

997
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:27,200
collected this together under the name

998
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,830
of remote integrity verification

999
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:31,889
informally it's been a remote

1000
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:37,920
attestation for years and years we

1001
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:43,050
started using the Rif which I'm told

1002
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:45,990
should be changed to River but we're

1003
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:48,720
using this acronym to describe this

1004
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:50,429
particular collection of bits and pieces

1005
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:53,220
which can be put together in a certain

1006
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:56,120
way to do this function right so within

1007
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:58,290
within TCG there's an intramural

1008
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:00,630
argument I don't think matters here

1009
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:03,000
about all the different kinds of

1010
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:05,430
attestation this is a kind and rather

1011
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,220
than say TCG attestation because that's

1012
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:10,920
not very well defined RIF is a

1013
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:16,230
particular aspect of that you know a

1014
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:18,090
particular kind this one is focused on

1015
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:21,889
network equipment because I work for a

1016
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:24,930
router company I think it extends to

1017
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:28,020
embedded systems pretty easily of more

1018
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:30,960
general sort and probably two other

1019
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:32,910
things it's not meant to close off by

1020
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,210
just that at the moment this is what

1021
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:37,230
we're focused on and of course the point

1022
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:42,240
of being here is we want to coordinate

1023
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:44,610
this work so there are a lot of pieces

1024
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,099
that go into this the important parts

1025
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:50,040
here I think it's obvious that all of

1026
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:56,180
the documents that relate to how a TPM

1027
01:18:50,040 --> 01:19:00,110
works are and should remain in TCG

1028
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:02,630
but if it involves protocols and models

1029
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,849
and communication and so on then it

1030
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:07,640
probably belongs here so we're trying to

1031
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:13,250
figure out how to get that that wants to

1032
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:16,670
happen the the stack that we're working

1033
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:18,710
with at the moment this is kind of a

1034
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:25,670
draft of how we can put all these pieces

1035
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:28,250
together has both TCG documents at the

1036
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:34,280
moment there is an information model for

1037
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:38,360
attestation for TPM 1.2 and 2.0 Hank has

1038
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:40,670
this hanks yang model lines up with this

1039
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:44,509
so we have those put together the rest

1040
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:54,650
of the stack on down as prior art is

1041
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:59,380
done he did did a mid 4 for this the

1042
01:19:54,650 --> 01:20:03,320
same query response to quote stuff and

1043
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:06,710
it was a tough project right so I think

1044
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:09,469
if we can focus on this stuff in IETF

1045
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:11,930
that would be great there's another half

1046
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:15,500
of this which i think is out of scope

1047
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:19,850
for rats right now which is how you

1048
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:22,130
handle the reference measurements and I

1049
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:29,450
think we'll probably discuss that more

1050
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:32,590
later but that's not for today there are

1051
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:40,070
a number of documents on this work at

1052
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:42,560
TCG and the draft and the and the

1053
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:46,759
version on the TCG website names a

1054
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,460
number of the documents TCG process is a

1055
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:52,550
little different from here so some of

1056
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:54,410
them are already published and freely

1057
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:57,800
available some of them are members only

1058
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:59,720
still I know there will be a number of

1059
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:03,230
companies in this room that are members

1060
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:08,660
of TCG so for those people you can just

1061
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:09,709
go look them up right and some of the

1062
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:13,090
ones that are in process

1063
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:18,800
are coming pretty close to public review

1064
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:22,640
okay any plans to head public review oh

1065
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:25,719
yeah yeah so I'm sorry to PCG in TCG

1066
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:28,880
process the document is developed inside

1067
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:31,960
the organization until its you know

1068
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:37,420
fairly cooked and then it's put out for

1069
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:43,040
public review and then published openly

1070
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:46,690
so this this the document referenced at

1071
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:48,920
the very beginning of this talk was

1072
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:51,620
unusual in that it's been published

1073
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:59,630
early in the cycle so that we could do

1074
01:21:51,620 --> 01:22:03,019
this work so I I want to end here what

1075
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:04,940
do we do next we would of course

1076
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,050
appreciate help in clarifying the

1077
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:09,040
workflow there are a number of

1078
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:11,690
assumptions that people who have been

1079
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:14,870
plugging away at this at gcg for so long

1080
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:16,460
can't see anymore so helping us

1081
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:19,190
understand what it is that we need to

1082
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:22,730
explain to get the picture right to feed

1083
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:24,589
into you know through the use cases into

1084
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,330
whatever it is at rats produces to

1085
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:31,640
ensure that we can support this case

1086
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:34,580
would be helpful I think we Justin I did

1087
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:37,969
not write the security considerations

1088
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:40,219
section and I think a discussion of the

1089
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:43,820
trust model probably fits in there

1090
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:46,340
pretty well and of course what we want

1091
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:49,670
to ensure is that the is that what comes

1092
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:52,370
out of rats works with this with this

1093
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:55,820
model there are a lot of PPM's out there

1094
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:57,500
and if we can start using them actually

1095
01:22:55,820 --> 01:23:04,160
for attestation that would be really

1096
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:05,810
cool I think I'm done questions hey Dave

1097
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,969
Taylor thanks for presenting this I have

1098
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:09,739
a clarifying question you're both of

1099
01:23:07,969 --> 01:23:12,200
your diagrams it was the figure to

1100
01:23:09,739 --> 01:23:14,000
figure for they both showed a tester and

1101
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:17,120
verifier but they did not show a relying

1102
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,100
party and so my question is is the

1103
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:21,080
relying party the same as the verifier

1104
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,889
or is this just talking about the

1105
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,419
evidence flow

1106
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:25,249
this is our fog '''l - what'd you do to

1107
01:23:23,419 --> 01:23:29,719
the providing party which one did you

1108
01:23:25,249 --> 01:23:33,019
mean it those two from money from my

1109
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:35,559
point of view what happens between the

1110
01:23:33,019 --> 01:23:38,899
relying party and the verifiers

1111
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:41,030
it's out of my scope one of those two

1112
01:23:38,899 --> 01:23:42,860
legs and you don't have any right the

1113
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:44,719
TCG does not have any requirements as to

1114
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:55,070
what happens in the other leg I don't

1115
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:56,479
think so okay yeah we didn't include it

1116
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:58,280
in this diagram because it wasn't part

1117
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:01,010
of our TCG dagger but I think in the one

1118
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:04,219
we submitted to this workgroup it is in

1119
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:06,110
there if I recall you know no exact in

1120
01:24:04,219 --> 01:24:07,669
the draft yeah I think I got lost in the

1121
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:09,860
sea of a skier but I think I threw it in

1122
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:11,360
there we intend to maintain a certain

1123
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:13,339
amount of alignment with whatever comes

1124
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,839
up of this group isn't architecture I

1125
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,760
don't think that's really the place

1126
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,689
where we have a lot of discrepancies

1127
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,149
between the two miles

1128
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:23,749
I don't think towards a different way I

1129
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:26,919
don't think TCG has an opinion on that

1130
01:24:23,749 --> 01:24:29,510
interaction right it's the verifier yeah

1131
01:24:26,919 --> 01:24:31,070
yeah I think one of the issues that you

1132
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:33,439
and Lauren's are both talking about is

1133
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:34,820
how interoperability with existing TPM

1134
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:36,860
practice is critical and the rents

1135
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,509
talked about how the actual format is

1136
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:39,889
critical because that's what the TPM

1137
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:41,689
actually generates or something if I got

1138
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:44,719
your point right right and so whether

1139
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:46,939
that particular format is it all

1140
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,709
relevant in the attestation result is

1141
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:50,899
kind of the gist of the requirement

1142
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:52,999
question or whether as long as the

1143
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:54,469
information model is the same if it gets

1144
01:24:52,999 --> 01:24:55,938
transformed in some way could that be

1145
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:57,590
done it sounds like there's actually no

1146
01:24:55,939 --> 01:24:58,729
exclusive requirement of this working

1147
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:00,409
group that's working group can come up

1148
01:24:58,729 --> 01:25:02,030
with whatever consensus we want is that

1149
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:04,219
a requirement from TCG the only

1150
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,509
requirement from TCG is about the

1151
01:25:04,219 --> 01:25:08,209
evidence flow being able to have

1152
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:11,090
literally whatever TPM support thank you

1153
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:13,489
okay so you we're gonna ask that

1154
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:15,590
question which is but I wanted to let

1155
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:18,739
Lawrence go first and that's the intent

1156
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:21,979
between TCG in and rats yeah so my

1157
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:24,049
question is just how well aligned is all

1158
01:25:21,979 --> 01:25:24,499
of this with the yang document the yang

1159
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:30,409
draft

1160
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:32,059
oh I mean is it I hope it's perfectly

1161
01:25:30,409 --> 01:25:34,219
aligned okay though that was all the

1162
01:25:32,059 --> 01:25:35,660
intent and all that so yes most people

1163
01:25:34,219 --> 01:25:37,580
in the TCG would be

1164
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:40,190
really happy if the anger draft was

1165
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:42,830
adopted and all that yes I believe so

1166
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:46,160
I mean I it's there aren't a lot of yang

1167
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:47,900
experts in TCG sore but I think the

1168
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:51,139
intent is that they are perfectly

1169
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:52,639
aligned yeah so the so that the and if

1170
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:55,190
they're not no we should fix it yeah

1171
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:56,870
okay okay so that makes the yang the

1172
01:25:55,190 --> 01:26:00,849
yang draft more interesting to read for

1173
01:25:56,870 --> 01:26:06,140
me knowing how deeply bad it is and

1174
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:08,270
we're gonna so we we do want to we want

1175
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:10,400
to close this off with a question in

1176
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:14,980
terms of what the expected interaction

1177
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:18,830
is between TCG and rats ietf / rats

1178
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:21,320
there is a some folks have asked whether

1179
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:23,480
or not I'd late some sort of liaison is

1180
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:25,750
required or if there is did you have

1181
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:31,490
something else in mind

1182
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:32,810
I think if we can get the from the TCG

1183
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:37,940
point of view that then got the yang

1184
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:39,740
model solid and that may require working

1185
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,870
back through information models and so

1186
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:46,040
on for the rest of rats but I think that

1187
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:49,010
the TCG yang model I think is the key so

1188
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:53,210
you had you had a bullet in there that

1189
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:55,970
said if you go back and tend to have

1190
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:58,160
strong collaboration between TCG and

1191
01:26:55,970 --> 01:27:00,290
rats so we're trying to understand what

1192
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:04,670
that means because from a formal process

1193
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:07,519
then we need to assign a liaison and so

1194
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:10,310
one thing TCG has asked me to keynote at

1195
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,590
their next meeting in Toronto so I know

1196
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:15,530
that Steven fellows are all right for

1197
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:16,850
the via yes he's not the liaison he can

1198
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:19,190
help us all

1199
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:28,790
oh so that's yes slightly different but

1200
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:31,009
okay right reduces responsible ad the

1201
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:33,050
IAB is ready to set up allies own if

1202
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:38,720
that's exactly kind of what we need so

1203
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:40,880
if we need that police say the work well

1204
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:43,250
the idea Amy would figure it out on our

1205
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,560
wealth from the ietf perspective we're

1206
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:47,810
asking a question yes or no do we need a

1207
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,580
liaison

1208
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:58,400
okay so so instructing the ad if we can

1209
01:27:52,580 --> 01:28:02,360
get a liaison that will it take 20

1210
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:04,639
seconds go ahead as a pest ie be member

1211
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:07,429
and the person here oath I be wiki page

1212
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:09,740
technically Bernard authored the text

1213
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:12,950
and then I put the site on the page in

1214
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:15,650
order to get a liaison person liaison

1215
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:17,240
manager then the IB has a specific set

1216
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:19,790
of questions that they like to answer

1217
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,840
and among those and I can't remember all

1218
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:23,600
of them I think they're on the public

1219
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,520
wiki maybe Roman has that path yeah yeah

1220
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,440
yeah that right so it's a like what do

1221
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,240
you what would the what could you do

1222
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,089
with the person that you couldn't do

1223
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,110
without the person as it where is it

1224
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:35,630
this is not the patient thank you so

1225
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:37,219
maybe on this page but because you don't

1226
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:42,860
need a person in order to send liaison

1227
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:44,210
statements right like so ie be is in

1228
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:46,460
charge of when you actually need to

1229
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:48,860
designate a person that's on behalf of

1230
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:50,390
IETF as a working group as the rats

1231
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:51,799
working group we can just Senate liaison

1232
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:55,940
statement that comes from the chairs you

1233
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:57,890
don't so when you're asking ID to do

1234
01:28:55,940 --> 01:29:00,259
something you should be saying here's

1235
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:01,970
what we need that person to do that's

1236
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:05,320
different from what we as chairs would

1237
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:08,390
do in just any of the SF State okay so

1238
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:12,679
Roman why don't we caucus between you

1239
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:16,220
and the chairs to make that decision my

1240
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:19,600
recommendation to you is to ensure that

1241
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:23,030
this gets captured in the use cases

1242
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,040
because you mentioned the expectation to

1243
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,990
have complete full alignment with the

1244
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,540
yang module which we haven't adopted yet

1245
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:35,410
but that should be accounted for as a

1246
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:35,410
requirement in these cases it is in

1247
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:40,850
submitted comments now we have 30

1248
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:42,019
seconds you want me to do it okay okay

1249
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:43,790
since we're out of time I'm just gonna

1250
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,620
run the questions we have 30 seconds

1251
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:50,240
thank you guys

1252
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:52,250
logistically I think and Kathleen was

1253
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:55,820
suggesting it sounds like we may need

1254
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:59,380
more than one interim so would there be

1255
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:59,380
opposition to having tube

1256
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:08,010
virtual yeah no face-to-face we have too

1257
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:22,980
many global - virtual interims versus

1258
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:24,990
three so it's okay so the reason why I'm

1259
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:27,120
saying this is I guess I should have

1260
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:31,740
started but the first question is we

1261
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:34,890
talked about teep dependencies on brats

1262
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:37,920
and having that use case there's a long

1263
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:39,960
discussion so which will be ongoing it

1264
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,550
wouldn't be a bad idea I'm looking at

1265
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:48,450
the tea co-chair to see if he cannot of

1266
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:51,390
having a joint virtual intern interim of

1267
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:53,370
I'm thinking an hour so what you're

1268
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:55,560
saying is you think there should be one

1269
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:57,210
or you're asking the question whether

1270
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,090
there's interest in having one at

1271
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:02,100
virtual interim that is the joint rats

1272
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:03,960
deep discussion yes and a separate

1273
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:06,480
virtual interim that is just the rest

1274
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:09,920
discussion right and then the question

1275
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:14,400
that's okay so let me ask the question

1276
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:17,970
value in the joint tea and rats

1277
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:20,879
if you object just raise your hand going

1278
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:24,590
once twice okay so we will put a doodle

1279
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:28,260
poll to put that one together and I'll

1280
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:32,130
caucus with that okay so for the rats

1281
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:34,140
working group items given that there was

1282
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:35,400
a lot of discussion and we still have a

1283
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:39,840
ways to go

1284
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:43,349
visa via the information model would it

1285
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:47,910
be worthwhile to have one versus two so

1286
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:50,840
let me just post a question would you

1287
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:54,059
have objections if there were two

1288
01:31:50,840 --> 01:32:01,020
virtual interims separate from the joint

1289
01:31:54,060 --> 01:32:03,060
with teeth so raise your hands no no so

1290
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:06,180
we'll have to figure out all of this

1291
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:09,540
will go out to the mail cuz we're two

1292
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:12,960
minutes over so if there are no

1293
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:13,880
objections we will post that to the mail

1294
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:19,040
list and

1295
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:21,710
then schedule them accordingly okay so

1296
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:23,179
blue sheets anybody need blue sheets

1297
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:25,550
they're up here just come on up

1298
01:32:23,179 --> 01:32:27,830
otherwise we're done thank you thank you

1299
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:33,650
to the minute takers and jabber scribe

1300
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:53,210
much appreciated I actually have a

1301
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:57,949
meeting right now well that's why I

1302
01:32:53,210 --> 01:33:00,670
think we will need one but the meetings

1303
01:32:57,949 --> 01:33:00,669
are closed
