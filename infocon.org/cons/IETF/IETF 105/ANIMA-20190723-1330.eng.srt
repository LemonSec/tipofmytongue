yeah but why should he be fun starts I

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:24,150
mean what I'm saying that was an idea

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:26,689
that came to mind okay really it's just

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,689
interesting

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:35,690

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:59,970
protocol but what that's that's that's

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:05,060
very very similar to two and at least

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,060

case to any man X so that that thickness

17
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:58,100
for cycles okay I mean something like

18
00:01:45,210 --> 00:02:01,520
that it's you know sure stuff next time

19

of the discuss well I would be happy to

68
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,740

69
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:45,060
don't have time today it went into is G

70
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,060
call on believe it was June 13th and

71
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:53,560
there were a great number of discusses

72
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:56,410
posted on June 12 10th 11th 12th which

73
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,650
arrived and I started to I'm sorry I

74
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,960
went into the review on July 11th not

75
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,280
July 10th and there was a number of

76
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,500
calls that came through there

77
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,989
I never discusses so there were six

78
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:13,720
substantive discusses plus about three

79
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:17,400
oh by the way I have I'm posting no

80
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:21,220
comment or or what was the right words

81
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,070
anyway the opposite of discuss and but

82
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,800
here are some comments anyway okay and

83
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,570
then several abstains that who people

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,919
who said and i also agree with so-and-so

85
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:35,440
is discussed so there was a lot of stuff

86
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,139
so I grown through the the bulk

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,020
six-and-a-half five and a half of the

88
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,330
six discusses and I have some

89
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,389
substantive comments from Ben could left

90
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,560
to do

91
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,190
Adam Roche has indicated to me by email

92
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,669
yesterday that he does not feel his

93
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:57,520
discusses are have been dealt with so

94
00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:04,419
there will be more discussion about that

95
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,430
and your comments on the mailing list

96
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,590
would be much appreciated to understand

97
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:15,010
what's going on christian read him out

98
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,590
posted a revision to his review at the

99
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,330
beginning of June I didn't see it until

100
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,349
I was asked why I didn't solve his

101
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,630
problems so from what I can tell from

102
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:30,900
having reviewed it I believe that all

103
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:35,260
his issues overlap with Adam and Ben

104
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,390
comments and so either sells them in one

105
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,819
group or I I won't

106
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,280
I am hoping to finish those comments

107
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,570
probably tonight I'm not going to the

108
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,150
social and post a new version by the end

109
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,600
of the week which I hope will be will be

110
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:55,000
it and if not I will spend some time

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,290
with the appropriate area directors

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,300
trying to understand what's going on

113
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,300
directly next slide please

114
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,410
we have done been doing Interop testing

115
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,010
of burski mostly between myself and a

116
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:15,400
team from siemens and some people are

117
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,960
working with them from Zed H a W which

118
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,880
is the Elliott might get it for me

119
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,880
Zurich techno University of Technology

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:30,930
something like this and we meet every

121
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,820
most Tuesday mornings to to basically

122
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,729
exchange log entries and see what

123
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,800
happened with our online test pieces in

124
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,420
the process of doing that we discovered

125
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,790
that we didn't on how a common

126
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,819
understanding of which parts of RFC

127
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,670
70:30 were base64 encoded whether that

128
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:53,470
was whether that was optional mandatory

129
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:57,310
or unwanted and whether or not brewski

130
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,740
had the same behavior right and to make

131
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,359
it worse some of us had coded things

132
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,460
that we didn't realize that we had coded

133
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,290
it that way so we were confused by our

134
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,650
own situation

135
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,969
the result is that seven RFC 70:30 which

136
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,290
is est which

137
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,449
he is a protocol an extension of has

138
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,069
some confusion and there was a document

139
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,579
in a presentation at SEC dispatch

140
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:23,560
yesterday on clarifying that and that

141
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,388
document I believe they have concluded

142
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,699
will go to the lamps working group which

143
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:29,800
is the kind of successor to P kicks to

144
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,479
do this your comments will be

145
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,670
appreciated that particularly if you

146
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,329
have an est implementation or intend to

147
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,219
write one as part of brewski so that you

148
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,319
can do this it doesn't look like we can

149
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,649
do anything other than say this was

150
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:46,209
clearly wrong but it's how it is so you

151
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,350
should cope with it and not be confused

152
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,349
next slide please

153
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,040
so that's just a little bit about the

154
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,719
about the Interop that has happened so

155
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,639
far and I've already mentioned that go

156
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:03,600
on and that's it for purpose key

157
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,600
questions yeah they're no more slides

158
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:11,670
my co-author max Pritikin has been given

159
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:13,719
a task that he could not say no to a

160
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,819
you've been complaining for several

161
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,379
years and now yours your opportunity to

162
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:22,089
fix it so shut up or do something and so

163
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,930
that's why you haven't seen a lot of him

164
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:27,610
but we actually do chat most every week

165
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,878
about this you just won't see much of

166
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,360
him his conscious self so go on to the

167
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:42,250
next part

168
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:45,100
I wrote constrained button yeah

169
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,709
so Peter Pan else and I have been

170
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,019
working on this document or since a

171
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:56,309
while there's not a lot of substantive

172
00:11:50,019 --> 00:12:00,430
changes to the core of the document we

173
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:04,029
updated some examples of Coast's signed

174
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,638
C bore and Jim shock ran it through his

175
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:09,910
coast implementation and found that they

176
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,059
were wrong so it's probably as important

177
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,319
to find out that they were right chill

178
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,959
trying to figure it exactly where

179
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:19,209
they're wrong at this point but we'll

180
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,650
get that right and we'll have to update

181
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:29,260
those examples again I have validated

182
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:32,319
Peters CMS signed example and that's

183
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,480
okay I don't know what this word variety

184
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,630
is in there some spell checking has

185
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,170
someone that's has got me yesterday most

186
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,790
issues reported by various people I

187
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:47,800
think it's supposed to saying having

188
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:50,800
resolved we I did introduce this leaf

189
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,939
node pin sha-256 or subject of public

190
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,800
key info and its utility is still under

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,279
dispute and I would sure like some some

192
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,540
comments about that we can make really

193
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,620
long leaf names because they get

194
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,480
translated to an integer anyway so don't

195
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,230
worry about you know that kind of thing

196
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,440
in there and with your the working

197
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,180
groups kind of active review of this I

198
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,089
think we could reach working last call

199
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,329
before I ATF 106 on this next slide

200
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,330
please

201
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:28,720
draft RIT of course CID they have more

202
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,270
or less been statically written into the

203
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,779
file we believe that we can generate

204
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,410
them correctly with PA now but more or

205
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,970
less we're we're not we're not being

206
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,579
overly optimistic about it being

207
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,029
consistent because the the code is still

208
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,200
not accepted upstream and had some

209
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,750
conversations of this so there's a

210
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,140
peeing extension that lets us translate

211
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:56,440
the RFC 83 66 vote trick model to see

212
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,569
Boer and it's an automated fashion I'm

213
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,140
told that the core working group will

214
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:07,480
have the CID documents in working group

215
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:13,620
last call any day now but come to the

216
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:17,830
core meeting and find out that's it so

217
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,930
the area director asked me to to figure

218
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,860
out that we update our milestones from

219
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,140
what I heard

220
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,180
could I assume that we're trying to

221
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,850
target getting this over twice GP for

222
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,449
107 sure

223
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,120
aye-aye

224
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,650
say I think we I would like to I think

225
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,580
we could be more aggressive than that I

226
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,100
think we could say get it out of IES I

227
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,590
think we could get it out of a es g

228
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,610
before 107

229
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,470
that's not my response I know that's

230
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,450
just talking to a working group she was

231
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,420
just once the enter milestone so I think

232
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:57,340
that the right answer is into submitted

233
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:59,740
to iesg right after 106 so working group

234
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,350
last call you know I think we could do

235
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,670
that we could be finished that by 106 is

236
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,360
so that you could put it into iesg

237
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:10,569
review there but for this document this

238
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,590
this does require I think it would I

239
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,280
think it would be helpful to have

240
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,720
someone else who might implement the

241
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,480
voucher the voucher part particularly

242
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,810
did you guys keep say to you could be

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,060
you know into the iest and get all to

244
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:33,609
you one idea from a teen cycle I don't

245
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:35,890
think so so as you said it's about when

246
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,080
you say give it to them but but based

247
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,390
upon what I've seen so far they are

248
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,800
processing many drafts and less than

249
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:47,020
that but maybe not all drafts so I don't

250
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,780
know maybe maybe you need to buy more

251
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:54,220
scotch for Thursday how long have we

252
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:56,140
take for a CP maybe four five idea of

253
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,070
meeting it's exponential with a number

254
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,750
of slides yeah so so is it is it is true

255
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,290
that longer documents are harder to deal

256
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,080
with but I would also say that it

257
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,089
depends on the this there's the the

258
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,650
there should be no political discussion

259
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,180
about this document because we're just

260
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,590
re-encoding brewski into some other

261
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,900
thing so I hope that will be easier to

262
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,880
discuss right so it won't become RC be

263
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,040
cooked before brewskis RFC normative

264
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,570
dependency well there is that point

265
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,569
anyway so there you go thank you

266
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,850
thanks for the slides there same time

267
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,710
okay I will talk about the constraint

268
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,940
join proxy services down together is

269
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,980
Michael and please the next slide so

270
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,440
it's a tells you it is in continuation

271
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,050
of the Biscay work is in translation and

272
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,890
talks actually about the about the joint

273
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,510
proxy

274
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,079
please go on we have done this already

275
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,849
last step so on graphic explanation of

276
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,919
what goes on we have to brace give us

277
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,839
the pledge which wants to be entered

278
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,270
into the network we have a proxy which

279
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,639
you can contact code link locally and

280
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,730
then you can over the global internet

281
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,180
you can contact the domain registrar and

282
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,150
instead of doing that HTTP TLS we do

283
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,330
that is coop DTLS with vouchers in Jung

284
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:34,670
and there is less problems with this

285
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:37,939
base64 I think so straightforward

286
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,620
document if compared to the formal

287
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,180
document version of the document what I

288
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:45,260
did I simplified it by having the the

289
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,880
stateful server

290
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,790
I removed the number of possibilities

291
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,770
there's only one now and I promised to

292
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,080
do something about the discovery and

293
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,530
actually I did it and so we'll talk

294
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,870
about it next time please

295
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,160
so the stay we have one two versions for

296
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,860
the joint proxy which was actually

297
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,570
demanded by one of the people who are

298
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,689
starting to implement it on is a

299
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,879
stateful and a stateless state fool

300
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,520
which keeps in the joint proxy it keeps

301
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,050
the addresses of the plates so that when

302
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,770
the answer comes backs he knows where to

303
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,930
sent it and the state less is less

304
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:24,230
information in the joint proxy so this

305
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:27,980
information is stored in the packet yep

306
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:31,460
next if there any questions please speak

307
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:36,290
out loud so the discovery is one of the

308
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:38,330
parties maybe will provoke discussion so

309
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,790
what we have is that you use coop and

310
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,889
then we look at the pledge and the joint

311
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,600
proxy this will be a link local poetry

312
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,580
mostly on a mesh it can be on other

313
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,320
things but for the moment you think of

314
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,540
using this on the mesh and link locally

315
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,480
so how will the Pledge discover that

316
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,520
you're in proxy I by doing co-op

317
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,770
discovery which is explained in the

318
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,679
document and is also the explained in

319
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,720
the resource discovery etc and there is

320
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,990
the six dish which uses to the house

321
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,900
beacon and Michael can explain that if

322
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,270
needed and then further on that if we go

323
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,370
to the global one we will get either we

324
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,889
use the Annie grasp bomb if it is

325
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,010
accurate this is for this environment

326
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,070
supports it if not any on e then the

327
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,110
will be done co-op discovery is there

328
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:28,270
anyone who thinks that more should be

329
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:34,309
done or less discoveries

330
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:35,600
Brian yes okay great I'm not sure how

331
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,178
you in time if there's a quick

332
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,120
explanation multi-hop court discoveries

333
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,370
that working is that yeah you can do so

334
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,620
what what you can do is two things you

335
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,080
have you can send and naughty casts this

336
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,059
co-op this co-op discovery which is

337
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,189
discouraged and you sent two well-known

338
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,320
core and all the ones which feel worse

339
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,240
we can do this we sent to announcer it's

340
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,000
discouraged we other thing which you

341
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,679
have a student and resource directory

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,630
okay so the resource directory is in

343
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,299
central um you can send in unicast and

344
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,580
will send you back all the devices which

345
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,100
have this particular service in its in

346
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,449
its memory and then you can approach the

347
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,730
one which you want to send there's

348
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,360
dynamic registration for the registrar's

349
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,570
with a directory if you like if you know

350
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,678
Bonjour

351
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:24,080
it versus multicast has there's records

352
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,290
this one actually is different it uses

353
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,699
the UI's and it looks at so it's not the

354
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,879
host names that set about this you arise

355
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,770
and it is it's think it can do filtering

356
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,840
married a DNS system

357
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:41,360
yeah let's go on so this is about the

358
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,500
the packet format for the stateless will

359
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,290
cost for the stateful it is

360
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,960
straightforward so what we will do and

361
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,668
this is a bit original so first and the

362
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,440
plate sensitive during proxy you have

363
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,600
the link local addresses and you have to

364
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,190
detail s payload and you don't want to

365
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,379
join proxy to look at the detail as

366
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,559
payload so it's sensed as own completely

367
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,679
and what it does it stands stores to the

368
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,928
addresses for the for the link local

369
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,370
addresses and for that to use multi-part

370
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,710
core and after

371
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,290
point out that this is a new media

372
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,930
format which is done in court and which

373
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,990
is also used in the constraint voucher

374
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:21,559
draft which has been proposed just a

375
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,570
former speaker so that store there and

376
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,450
then it goes back down below I have an

377
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,540
example of what the what it looks like

378
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,880
so you have an uber array and in the

379
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,159
super array you first put in what is the

380
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,860
format of the next item in this case it

381
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,450
is an array of two identities and then

382
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,020
there is the next one which tells you

383
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,030
that it is in the format the format

384
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,230
which was roost in the standard EST and

385
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:50,870
then it gives you the detail s content

386
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,760
no IP an IP think Michael is right that

387
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,159
before but it is more complex you have a

388
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:01,960
lot of Archer headers etc and while this

389
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:06,230
is about our locally done and shorter I

390
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,580
showed this one before which is in but

391
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,470
the Edition is here that for the

392
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,320
constraint your joint proxy I have added

393
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,600
that it actually uses the multi-part CT

394
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,879
draft which was also used in the voucher

395
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,620
so that is the difference with the same

396
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:27,230
table which has show what three months

397
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:31,969
ago anybody remembers this currently any

398
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:37,520
questions then I have seen that in the

399
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:40,100
new draft in the new charter the name is

400
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,170
mentioned so I'm looking forward to the

401
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,260
acceptance of the new Charter and then

402
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,820
later on and working group acceptance of

403
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,460
this topic there as far as the

404
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,250
milestones even for for for the stuff or

405
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,900
especially for the stuff that is a meant

406
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,880
to be first adopted and is on the list

407
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,070
there we've been asked to come up with

408
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,590
milestones so we basically been thinking

409
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:05,419
that adoption could hopefully start

410
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:09,199
before 106 in depending on I be you know

411
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,460
not sleeping at the wheel and so you

412
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,290
know what what do you think how much

413
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,929
work would be left from that point on

414
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,399
this thing is now reasonably complete

415
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,770
that was very much worried about the

416
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,350
discovery but I don't hear too many

417
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,539
opposes not actually

418
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:27,590
so I think it is rather well and well

419
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:30,080
advanced unless somebody sink find some

420
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,209
major mistakes say the whole approach is

421
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,330
wrong also

422
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:40,549
yep and so um I asked how many people

423
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:43,070
have read the draft no no wait wait

424
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:48,649
they're not that slow and so I'm not

425
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:57,799
that fast I am that slow five six seven

426
00:23:48,649 --> 00:24:00,709
thank you no it's it's been a long time

427
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,330
so I don't even remember anymore it's

428
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,399
very early on so I need to relieve it

429
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,960
okay fine

430
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,959
sounding autos don't count sighs

431
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,919
congratulations

432
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:38,209
yep take your time

433
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:38,570
walk slowly where the heck yeah all

434
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,019
right

435
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:48,918
hi everybody its Ali I am talking here

436
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:53,470
about something called brewski AE it's

437
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,470
dated trekker meditation okay

438
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:11,799
once almost there this one here that's

439
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:14,770
on let's check this one day all right so

440
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,559
I'm presenting today on behalf of my

441
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,840
co-author is Stefan freeze and Hendrick

442
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,940
rock house who are the major drivers of

443
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,080
this draft I'm the least major driver of

444
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,620
the traffic slide please

445
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:32,830
we're talking about in this context is a

446
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:37,299
a draft and one before this is that yeah

447
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:38,918
thank you so that this draft is misnomer

448
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:40,600
it's not really a brewski problem that

449
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,020
we're attempting to address but there's

450
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,928
a little bit of a trick in est that we

451
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:51,520
wanted to highlight with regard to some

452
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:54,040
asynchronous enrollment issues and so

453
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,418
the issue that this and I think this

454
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,520
draft was presented last time so I'm

455
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,679
going to be relatively quick the

456
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,150
fundamental issue here is what happens

457
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:08,140
if the CA in some form another is

458
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:09,940
detached from the join registrar and is

459
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,240
unable to issue certificates in any

460
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:17,860
given moment in time now it turns out

461
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,660
EST in RFC 70/30 anticipates this

462
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,090
problem a little bit in terms of being

463
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,370
able to take its to offer with various

464
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,889
return codes however I'm pretty sure

465
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:30,010
that our implementations haven't

466
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:33,340
anticipated this in pace of at the same

467
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,830
pace and so this draft addresses the

468
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,129
asynchronous nature that may occur where

469
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:41,820
you want to have essentially in a fully

470
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,900
encapsulated and self-sufficient

471
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,168
certificate request with a fully

472
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:50,650
encapsulated and I'm talking about a

473
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:55,679
piece a cue pkcs7 request for the pkcs7

474
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,820
response next slide please

475
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,030
so I've been a couple of changes from

476
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,010
the previous draft we've updated the

477
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,980
examples because I myself didn't

478
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,320
understand the darn thing in terms of

479
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,760
how this would work in building

480
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,060
automation which is where a lot of the

481
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,420
work

482
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,320
focusing on and this is definitely one

483
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,880
of those cases where you have

484
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,220
intermittent intermittent connectivity

485
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:23,740
and so having a mechanism to to to

486
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,260
address the certificate enrollment in

487
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,240
that environment is very important what

488
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,170
we've also done is a bit of a mapping to

489
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,120
the various enrollment protocols so when

490
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,820
mr. Friis first started this draft he he

491
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,379
looked at this somewhat in the abstract

492
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,669
and I said well that's just too abstract

493
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,160
for me because I don't think so

494
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,170
abstractly and so he has now done the

495
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,950
mapping of of this into two different

496
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,110
protocols and we'll go through that

497
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,330
there's the the architecture picture is

498
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:56,439
a little bit crisper and we've removed a

499
00:27:52,330 --> 00:28:10,480
bit of gunk and so next slide the click

500
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:18,970
is actually working no that was me as it

501
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:20,560
okay so okay well here's the X x marks

502
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,420
the spot

503
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,060
so the asynchronous enrollment in terms

504
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:28,810
of self-contained objects so the key

505
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:31,750
thing here is that we need for the proof

506
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,010
of possession the private key in terms

507
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:37,840
of corresponding the public key as it

508
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:40,060
says here three self-contained and we

509
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,810
need an indication essentially when a

510
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,310
request goes out to the in EST that I'd

511
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:49,020
like a certificate please

512
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:51,790
the essential point here is that the the

513
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:55,690
join registrar has to be able to say

514
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:58,659
it's it to respond no super you come

515
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,860
back and well some period of time and I

516
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,240
think in fact that's mentioned in the

517
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,979
draft now if you guys don't know the

518
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,710
reference of no suit for you that's

519
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,630
Jerry Seinfeld and a particular

520
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,030
character there when he gets annoyed and

521
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,890
he tells somebody no soup for you in

522
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,080
this case the the annoyances with the

523
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,880
fact that the CA is not present so no

524
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,850
suit for you come back for your for your

525
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,620
certificate request for your stupid

526
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,990
think of it responds in in some period

527
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,439
of time this means by the way that you

528
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,470
have to

529
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,290
a certificate request that is serialized

530
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,010
such that the client can remember all

531
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,460
this fun stuff

532
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:35,500
Peter Peter thunderstruck in the East he

533
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,780
called as draft we were also looking at

534
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:42,100
this problem you may know is it the same

535
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:44,230
problem probably so then it can help

536
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,389
each other that's right so the point of

537
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,890
this this this draft actually what

538
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,220
becomes of this draft is something we

539
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,170
need to discuss because it's clear that

540
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,480
it there's at least some guidance here

541
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:59,710
just for 70/30 there's probably

542
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,200
additional text that the constrained est

543
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,240
co-op draft needs to take a good stare

544
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,700
up to make sure you have your return

545
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,620
codes correct in terms of how you're

546
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,030
managing those since this full restful

547
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,159
interface I don't think that should be a

548
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,540
problem but you may need to apply a

549
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,430
little bit of guidance from this draft

550
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,440
into that draft and that would be

551
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,270
sufficient because we're not calling for

552
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,670
a whole lot in this draft except as

553
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,040
you'll see that we're we're asking for

554
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,470
one particular thing that you'll have to

555
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:34,110
check in terms of Kozai to make sure

556
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:34,110
that it looks good okay next slide so

557
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,000
alright so I think that this diagram

558
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,710
probably didn't come out correct but

559
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,180
this is just a recap I'm not going to go

560
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,060
through all of this because you know it

561
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,670
all next slide that was still correct in

562
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:51,100
PowerPoint I hope it is that one looks

563
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,200
better okay so this diagram is updated

564
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,730
this isn't a draft and you can see

565
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,740
clearly that what we've done here is

566
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,340
we've separated out the join proxy from

567
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,980
the lra

568
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,740
and that is really the the key to all of

569
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:06,160
this is that there is and whenever you

570
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,830
see an either an LRA or SCA there's this

571
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,570
idea that one or the other may not be

572
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,600
available at any particular point in

573
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,730
time now it's already well anticipated

574
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,230
that the Massa may not be available at

575
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,990
some point in time but the idea that the

576
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,330
LRA is not available in any particular

577
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,040
point in time that's something that at

578
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,790
least the code doesn't test right - in

579
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:30,210
some cases from what I hear so next

580
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,210
slide please

581
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,730
alright so here's the mapping that was

582
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:39,480
done so for est for this to work

583
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,670
what we need is a full full CMC request

584
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,400
and you need to make sure that you're

585
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,200
returning it 202 status when the LRA is

586
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,420
not available

587
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,660
and that's because there are times when

588
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,700
the as you see there the pkcs 10 has to

589
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,650
be regenerated if the if there's a

590
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,960
teardown event

591
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,840
similarly with CMP pretty much this

592
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,120
capability is already available if

593
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,909
you're using CRM F so there's nothing to

594
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,040
do

595
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,560
and so the there's also a cert waiting

596
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,540
indication available as I understand it

597
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,830
in CMP already so again there's nothing

598
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,830
to use and so forth

599
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:20,409
est the key thing here is that you there

600
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:23,830
you can't use the simple request which

601
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:27,550
people sometimes use in order to this

602
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:31,030
you need a full CMC and so that's the

603
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:32,740
the the key thing that Stephane fries

604
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,420
would call out and the reason for that

605
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,550
is that the request has to be

606
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,070
self-contained and that you're relying

607
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:42,100
on the identity of the signer in the

608
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,450
full CMC rather than anything else for

609
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,310
for authentication

610
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:51,760
Michael Michael Richardson so we have

611
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:59,590
specified simple enroll in both brueski

612
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:01,120
and constrained brewski yep and I don't

613
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:05,050
couldn't say it I don't really know what

614
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,489
full CMC does that is different and but

615
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,550
based on what you just said and put on

616
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:12,130
the the slide I had only even less about

617
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:16,870
what it's different because CSRs are

618
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:18,100
signed by the end entity so I don't

619
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,840
really know I never really understood

620
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,560
that to be all about your request this

621
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,919
signed well we all know that when you

622
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,190
post a CSR on your simple enroll you

623
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:33,550
post a CSR yeah it's yes it's the key

624
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,350
cs10 so I don't understand what what I

625
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,980
never understood the full CMC did other

626
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,360
than add more asn.1 you so I I'm gonna

627
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,790
say I'm just ignorant of not

628
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,370
understanding that at all so I would

629
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:48,250
perhaps you could motivate us more to

630
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:50,559
understand what what it is that you

631
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,179
think is tell us what it is lacking

632
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,110
understanding what it's lacking so

633
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:57,570
there's not there's my understanding is

634
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,549
there are two things that are lacking

635
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,049
and it's Stefan who's gonna have to

636
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:03,940
answer this an email more than more so

637
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:06,129
than me almost representing him the

638
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,629
first the first thing that is lacking is

639
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:10,359
that there's no serialization for the

640
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:12,368
requests available in the in the simpler

641
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:13,779
neural so that you can't keep track of

642
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:17,129
the requests on one side or the other

643
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,839
and that's so that's one thing that he

644
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:22,598
identify need to be awful if something

645
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,869
is offline I've sent you something and

646
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:29,260
you sent me back here's your drink

647
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,579
voucher okay come back go to the guy at

648
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,190
the end of the line and get your your

649
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:35,649
certificate right that's what's lacking

650
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,869
what's lacking but very specifically is

651
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,969
how do I match up the request for the

652
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:42,520
response because they're not in order

653
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:45,040
yeah ok so there's some of that and the

654
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,359
second thing that is apparently lacking

655
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,449
is some amount of identity information

656
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:51,699
in the request and this is that's why

657
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,868
the that's what full CMC is for is to

658
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,790
provide the additional identity

659
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,730
information signing it in the I divided

660
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,890
B in particular so at the risk of

661
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,730
causing more delay if this is if this is

662
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:06,910
as serious as you say then I believe

663
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,829
that Persky should be change to specify

664
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,399
full CMC this is an announced key

665
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:12,220
problem

666
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,020
it's an est problem yes but but but the

667
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,500
point is that est defines these two

668
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,450
things

669
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,130
brueski says you may say implement

670
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,879
you'll be compliant if you implement

671
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,530
this subset of est we need to

672
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,510
investigate that and so that's what I'm

673
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,040
saying is it is it well okay so we need

674
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,099
to say you need to be this this other

675
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,460
subset right simple and role will not be

676
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:35,530
enough and in this in this use case in

677
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,710
this particular user particular use case

678
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:41,560
so it may be enough to say that in in an

679
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:44,920
additional you situation you need full

680
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,930
CMC okay no time we can know we can make

681
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,490
this thing be an update to brewski

682
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:51,598
so I'm trying well I think that that

683
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:57,640
that this thing will be anyway exactly

684
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,370
but I'm just trying to think about what

685
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,470
what

686
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,440
how much changes are required to each

687
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:06,620
component by this and if it's something

688
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,720
that it was you know blue or orange and

689
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:11,960
we picked blue and you want an orange

690
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,580
solves the problem and there's only two

691
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,010
two or three implementations out there

692
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:19,009
and maybe we've implemented orange as

693
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,350
well anyway then we should just say do

694
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,180
orange and forget a blue but blue has

695
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:25,880
been running this five year marathon is

696
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,410
shortly before the finish line and you

697
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,050
don't want to have it change its shirt

698
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:33,200
color right now so to be clear right

699
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:35,570
there's a lot of mechanism here where

700
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,129
you don't need full CMC there are a lot

701
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,980
of these cases where you don't need full

702
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:41,900
yeah I'm John I have never from reading

703
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,230
the specifications had any understanding

704
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,820
of what full CMC did other than give you

705
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,000
lots of extension points that no one

706
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,320
implemented that's always been my

707
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,660
observations like well that's cool

708
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,940
that's a you know mr. Inspector Gadget

709
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,129
hat blue blue blue and I just wanted a

710
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,670
knife right so no I actually think that

711
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:04,130
the what this is if we need to update

712
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,290
then we update but what I was hoping for

713
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,810
more and maybe that one word change

714
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:11,390
would be that there's a minimum set that

715
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,590
you can implement with ruski and if you

716
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,569
have to implement and for these

717
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,510
particular use cases then you do the

718
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,280
full CMC inset so it's what I was really

719
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,470
hoping for was more of a BCP or

720
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,900
something along those lines to where

721
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,669
where you essentially say here's how you

722
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,160
do this with brewski here's how you do

723
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,830
this with EST and actually there there

724
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,720
aren't any protocol changes needed in

725
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,759
those particular cases so it could be

726
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,040
that if you want to tweak a word or two

727
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,230
to allow for that possibility now's a

728
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,910
good time to do that all right

729
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,480
and then then this can come out as some

730
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:46,310
sort of ECP but i mean you know you're

731
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,080
implementing something what do i need to

732
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,310
implement that's a standards intra

733
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,620
equation so

734
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:55,040
brueski right now says csr which is fine

735
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:57,859
which doesn't solve all the use cases we

736
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,810
figure out somewhat later the the this

737
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,580
thing fully we make it an update that's

738
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,080
an additional thing I don't know if

739
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,299
there is such a big difference in the

740
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,000
actual coding to support both of these

741
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,130
messages and just in further you know

742
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,900
convoluting the existing brewski with

743
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,240
something which might have been a better

744
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,890
choice maybe when we started out but so

745
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,689
late in the process changing that again

746
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,950
I'm not sure how how useful that is so

747
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,210
I'm not sure we're saying at this point

748
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,950
Carlos are you saying are you suggesting

749
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,140
now I'm not saying that we delay the

750
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,210
process okay that's not what I'm saying

751
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,470
I'm saying if Michaels got the document

752
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,020
before him and there's a one or two word

753
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,339
tweak that that would satisfy this he

754
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,500
should think about putting in one or two

755
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:35,150
worth tweak that's all I'm not only

756
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,859
worried about the documents but I think

757
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,390
Mike Lai's also indicated that there is

758
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,220
a good of community of people already

759
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,348
working or having implementations and

760
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:46,038
I'd like to take that into account as

761
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:47,450
well and I'm not sure that you know well

762
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:49,010
I mean I was going to ask this at the

763
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,509
end which which is basically what do we

764
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,569
think is the timeline of this thing but

765
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:56,630
in the first place what what actually is

766
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:57,920
the no suit policy is the no suit policy

767
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,799
something like come back in 10 minutes

768
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,150
or you don't get it now try to figure

769
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:05,930
out when you can try it again you have

770
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,890
to poll how does this I don't have the

771
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,180
dropped in front of you at the moment

772
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,770
but I think what it says this here's a

773
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,529
time period in which you should retry

774
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:15,410
okay so it is the comeback in 10 minutes

775
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:18,109
or an hour might you know your join

776
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:21,230
registrar is available but you're but

777
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:22,700
your LRA is not available please please

778
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,880
come back and try again when the LRA has

779
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,339
has is once again available so what's

780
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,049
the system designed by which the LRA the

781
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:31,578
local one would actually know that you

782
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:34,309
know delivery of certificates is

783
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:36,140
available in 10 minutes or 10 hours they

784
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:37,640
may not know the exact timing but they

785
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,529
made me an implement a back-off

786
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,970
algorithm like the joint registrar might

787
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:43,940
implement a back-off algorithm on its

788
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:46,970
side so the idea would be well you know

789
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,160
on the building on under construction

790
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:52,368
you know connectivity is spotty or

791
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,618
whatever the case may be back you know

792
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:56,529
back off and determine if it's a short

793
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,609
term fail your long term failure and

794
00:39:56,529 --> 00:40:00,079
eventually the devices get registered

795
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:02,180
and then it'll also be based you can

796
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,500
also paste it on load and the idea is

797
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,629
you don't have to do a full request

798
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,849
again you can just do the you know are

799
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,190
you there are you going into details

800
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:12,049
like that you know the LRA might need to

801
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,579
persist in storage because you know all

802
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:15,380
the time when the request comes in and

803
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,059
before the reply it might been rebooted

804
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,210
itself it sounds like not so much the

805
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:22,400
LRA but the join registrar wasn't that

806
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,580
the LRA to join that it's the join

807
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,190
registrar that is available the LRA that

808
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:32,090
the LRA doesn't need to it doesn't need

809
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:35,960
to retain that sort of state the pledge

810
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:39,830
has connectivity only to the LRA right

811
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:55,130
and the PK IRA at the bottom that's the

812
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:56,690
one remotely not available right right

813
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,760
but I'm saying that this local thing

814
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,530
that's always available or maybe not

815
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,060
even that always available I'm saying

816
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,400
right if if this whole thing is about

817
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,290
not only interrupted network

818
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,750
connectivity but also interrupted

819
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,790
operations of things on site and I'm

820
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,830
just wondering how how much more we

821
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,350
should say not only about the protocol

822
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,120
stuff but also the note behavior to make

823
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:21,440
it to create a reliable system right

824
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:26,390
yeah I think so

825
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,220
to wrap this up we think that the use

826
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:30,890
case is really valid that much I'll say

827
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,649
you know it's absolutely necessary that

828
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:36,020
we understand that intermittent

829
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,360
connectivity will happen for some of

830
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,370
these use cases this address is one

831
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,800
particular component that we previously

832
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,839
looked as an internal component to the

833
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,450
join registrar which we're externalizing

834
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,780
right and so in in externalizing it we

835
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,730
need to make sure that the that first of

836
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,190
all that the join registrar is able is

837
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,660
in a position to say come back which we

838
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,270
have the text there to do that

839
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,730
that the certificate request and the

840
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:05,870
certificate the certificate request

841
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:08,870
itself can be passed forward to the to

842
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,910
the to the CA when it's available and

843
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:15,770
then responded to in a timely manner

844
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:17,420
when that when the when the CA comes

845
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:20,090
back online and the key thing here right

846
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,060
is the depending on the timing right the

847
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:25,460
CA may be online when the device isn't

848
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,660
and vice versa and that's um that's a

849
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,700
use case that we have to be able to

850
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:33,589
handle as well and and you know I mean

851
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,060
these things typically end up being

852
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,040
something where people may want to ask

853
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,080
for a sequence picture

854
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,380
yeah office things when it's this up in

855
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,390
this

856
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,339
so these these minimum examples to

857
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,618
justify whatever complexity were adding

858
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:48,828
in the system right so my proposal then

859
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:51,980
is that we adopt this as as follow-on

860
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:53,509
work to the brewski brewski and then we

861
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,609
can decide as we're going through the

862
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:59,150
follow-on work whether it updates

863
00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:02,299
brueski or whether it it's it's own

864
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,009
thing well I mean I think it would

865
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:05,660
always be an update to brewski the I

866
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:08,630
think the update question is really is

867
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,308
it going to add full CMC as another

868
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,109
option that if this brewski

869
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:16,700
implementation should do or is it

870
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:19,700
replacing the CSR with full CMC I yeah

871
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,558
so my my gut tells me we should not

872
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,299
replace but that's I think the

873
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,160
discussion that the work we have if we

874
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:27,019
have critical mask off you know ongoing

875
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,640
implementations then we shouldn't I

876
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:29,750
think so - yes so with that without

877
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,430
having been said right that's a

878
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,769
discussion for the working group us and

879
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,328
what I'd ask is that if if we can

880
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:39,740
consider adopting this I think it would

881
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:41,359
be useful you know the next and so that

882
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,500
with the working group can start work on

883
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:51,019
it in the next cycle this presumes that

884
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:53,029
the brewski draft is approved well that

885
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:54,709
actually even if the brewski draft isn't

886
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:56,569
approved we probably want to look at

887
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,450
this in the context of you know what

888
00:43:56,569 --> 00:44:03,589
about est alone but I'm presuming that

889
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:06,470
the the the brewski draft adoption dia

890
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:08,299
date of mud I'm what I said was I'd like

891
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,609
to I'd like to see this draft adopted

892
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:14,538
please um if the if the working group

893
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:17,450
has interest and but of course that

894
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:19,490
presumes that draft anima boots you know

895
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,069
bootstrapping remote key infrastructure

896
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,598
is approved by the isg right because

897
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:29,170
otherwise what what would we do with

898
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:42,230
this drop okay okay I think yeah yeah so

899
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:45,730
yeah okay trying to sneak bonus so the

900
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:49,009
status of the brewski Draft is that it

901
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:52,130
there was a question raised in AGA are

902
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:53,150
they is there fundamentally against all

903
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,700
of this

904
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,440
or just the problems that specific

905
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,680
problems that identified need to be

906
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,410
fixed and it's a problems that need to

907
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,390
be fixed so you have a big list of

908
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:09,828
discusses that needs to be addressed and

909
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:13,609
that is going somehow not fast but that

910
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,809
is moving so once that is resolved the

911
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:17,150
document is approved

912
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:20,450
mm-hm so it's it's not a question that

913
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,349
there is a fundamental opposition to the

914
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,750
brueski itself

915
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:25,279
I didn't mean to restate that there is

916
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,520
it's just I I was thinking the matter of

917
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:34,670
timing more than anything else okay

918
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:36,440
thank you if once once brewski is

919
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:39,619
approved if we could start the adoption

920
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,839
process for this I would appreciate who

921
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:47,119
has read who is not an author and has

922
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:49,520
read this document okay yeah that's

923
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,299
that's fine one one two three okay

924
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,220
three people yeah please four okay yeah

925
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:58,839
please please read it if you're

926
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,839
interested in you know the use case

927
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:33,119
I'm taking my time as well sorry not

928
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:37,799
intentionally but just this one it's the

929
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,940
only one we have on offer left so what

930
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,760
we're looking at here does a few use

931
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,859
case we're trying to solve we're trying

932
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,920
to solve this end to end enrollment of

933
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:50,350
certificates on Hardware endpoint

934
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,589
devices all the way back to the CA and

935
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:55,440
[Music]

936
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:56,578
so this draft the summary is and we've

937
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,630
got the time so if you don't need to run

938
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:00,300
through this wrong with you fast what

939
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,839
the EST which they just basically define

940
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,460
is the mechanism by which an endpoint

941
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:08,549
exchanges CSRs and signed certificates

942
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,320
with the RA and but the EST doesn't

943
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,890
define the mechanism by which the RA

944
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,930
talks to the certificate authority an

945
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,730
ACME defines the protocol that a CA and

946
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,279
an African can use to automatic automate

947
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,079
the process of cert issuance and what

948
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,109
this trap covers while a covers multiple

949
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,060
use cases but one is how a nice tra can

950
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:29,220
turn around the news Atkins back ends to

951
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,980
fully automate end-to-end certissue ins

952
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,169
all the way to the CA and there should

953
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,710
be no changes reported to the existing

954
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,900
acne

955
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,790
East he or bruski drafts but some stuff

956
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,000
is probably under specified and we'll

957
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:44,310
talk for that in miners' sorry can I ask

958
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,970
is it because I thought that it was also

959
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:50,490
possible to use est from RA to ca but

960
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:55,230
maybe I'm mistaken on that well if you

961
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:56,759
read the if you read the EST spec and it

962
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:59,790
explicitly says it's out of scope

963
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,190
okay it's almost go with the history but

964
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:04,259
how the or how the or a talks you to see

965
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:07,650
is out of scope of TST draft okay

966
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:12,000
and so you specifically want to go with

967
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:15,329
acme is there justification coming was

968
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,430
because actually is it still it's the

969
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:23,160
only public standard for automating

970
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:24,120
suresh ones to a CA okay so it's we've

971
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,100
goodness an idea

972
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,630
than the a quick working group witness

973
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,000
here it's it's sticking to do together

974
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:32,040
but there are there are gaps you dressed

975
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,810
you want to do that and so there's

976
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,560
multiple there's multiple use cases in

977
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:39,240
in the draft and the first one is

978
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,130
important Acme issuances Optima inserts

979
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,839
so for those that are familiar with Acme

980
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:50,280
if you read the Acme specification and

981
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:52,410
it describes how a client will prove

982
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,120
ownership an identifier and then the

983
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,149
Acme draft will issue a certificate with

984
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,710
other identifiers built into it and

985
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,150
what's actually ambiguous in the draft

986
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,340
and we discussed this in the Acme work

987
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,560
group yesterday is it's possible for our

988
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,900
clients to prove ownership of a domain

989
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,360
and for the Acme server to issue

990
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,940
certificates against a subdomain of that

991
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,150
domain so it's possible with a draft for

992
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,850
a client to prove ownership of a parents

993
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,320
domain and then get issued many money

994
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,759
search result millions off that parent

995
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,230
to many without having to prove

996
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,860
ownership of all the explicit subdomains

997
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:28,980
and at that standard process for public

998
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,480
CAS today and there was consensus in the

999
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,060
Acme work group yesterday that that yes

1000
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,490
we do need to formally document that

1001
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,380
acne process so that we can firmly

1002
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:40,259
document that a CA Authority running

1003
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,670
Acme can require a client to prove

1004
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,860
ownership of parent domain and then

1005
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,100
issue multiple certs against and

1006
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:49,860
subdomains without requiring further

1007
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,299
ownership challenges the draft covers

1008
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,740
multiple different client device

1009
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,330
integrations and it's built on top of

1010
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,339
the sodium inserts and the subdomain

1011
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:58,020
insert stuff is really a an optimization

1012
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,330
it cuts out all the challenges and cost

1013
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,550
Halawa dns traffic and the draft

1014
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,770
coverage for use gives the est brewski

1015
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:08,910
T and T brewski and what I'm going to

1016
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:10,140
cover today is just a brewski one and

1017
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:14,040
there's a couple of related drafts

1018
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:16,560
saritha trees here is trying to figure

1019
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,200
out how to use acne for issuing search

1020
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,330
securely to client devices which is

1021
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,890
exactly what brewski does and that's

1022
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:25,560
exactly what I'm trying to do here as

1023
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,240
well is use acne for issuing certs

1024
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,529
security to client devices so it's a bit

1025
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,520
of work required to align these huge

1026
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,850
rafts and figure out how to work out

1027
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,160
together

1028
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:34,589
Kathleen also has a draft published

1029
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,089
Donna using acne free Xuan client-side

1030
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,260
device as well so it's a bit of work

1031
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,070
required to figure out how these three

1032
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,570
things align

1033
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,070
there is a we have had some pretty

1034
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,200
discussions there's a psych meeting

1035
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,520
tomorrow morning 9:00 a.m. anybody who

1036
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,770
was interested in trying to stitch

1037
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:52,770
together est or Bruce connect me please

1038
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:55,350
attend this meeting tomorrow so what I'm

1039
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:56,850
going to jump in through now is at a

1040
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,350
very very high level how you can stitch

1041
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:00,120
please connect me together so this is

1042
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,610
straight from the Acme specification

1043
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,130
it's copy these screenshots were taken

1044
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:09,660
directly from the Acme integrations

1045
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:10,200
draft it just covers how a pledge or a

1046
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,600
cloud

1047
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,850
it covers how a nice DRA can prove

1048
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,279
ownership of a parent domain using

1049
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:19,259
standard Acme procedures as you can see

1050
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,700
the East tra the example are given here

1051
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,130
is the easier a is just proving

1052
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,589
ownership of domain.com and I tell start

1053
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,910
by publishing a Dinah's text record and

1054
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:31,410
then remove from the text record once

1055
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:32,730
ownership is complete and then this is

1056
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,770
where we jump into the brewski thing and

1057
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,390
this isn't the definitive full

1058
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,070
end-to-end brewski flow I've just shown

1059
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:40,230
the most relevant parts I'm missing some

1060
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,550
of the messages that's fine and so when

1061
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,990
the pledge boots up and the pledge has

1062
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,330
discovered the RA the pledge and

1063
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:46,799
requests a voucher the RA will interact

1064
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,240
with the master server get a voucher and

1065
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,400
it'll be returned to the pledge the

1066
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,009
pledge will then do a simple enroll not

1067
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,710
standing the previous presentation that

1068
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:58,590
we just made pledge will do a simple

1069
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:01,560
roll on poster because he is 10 get back

1070
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:03,480
a tool to retry after and then the RA

1071
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,450
will then turn around and talk and it's

1072
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:10,170
back ends to Acme to complete that order

1073
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:11,520
and get issued a signed certificate one

1074
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,260
of the interesting things here for the

1075
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,640
Acme people after people that were

1076
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,050
familiar Acme in the room is that

1077
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,549
there's no challenges involved here

1078
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:20,310
there's no interaction between the est

1079
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:21,720
or in DNS because there's no need to

1080
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,810
prove ownership of all the subdomain

1081
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:29,819
identifiers and one thing that I've

1082
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:31,860
shown here is that the CSR that the

1083
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,990
pledge has generated has pledged Aidid

1084
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,510
at domain.com so one thing that is not

1085
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:41,720
specified really in EST or on brewsky

1086
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:43,190
Oran this draft here is how the pledge

1087
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,720
securely

1088
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:48,080
determines what the main to put into CSR

1089
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,080
requests

1090
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,940
so once this there's a second last slide

1091
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:58,369
here so once the REA has obtained the

1092
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,260
show ticket from Acme and when the

1093
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:01,580
pledge then goes to re-enroll after

1094
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,740
whatever time I was specifying the two

1095
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:07,609
or two and the oricon then issued a

1096
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,959
search to the pledge and discussion is

1097
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:10,640
just a broader interest like we are

1098
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,930
giving serious consideration to building

1099
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,690
this for some of our hardware endpoints

1100
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,310
and this short presentation was given on

1101
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,140
Acme a similar one will be given an emu

1102
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:20,359
tomorrow because this could be equally

1103
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,129
if they cause a teep teep and back-end

1104
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:25,220
could turn around and use Acme to get

1105
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:26,510
issued a certificate and again the side

1106
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,990
meeting is tomorrow morning so if you're

1107
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:42,230
interested please attend that is the

1108
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:44,149
last slide so my question isn't really

1109
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:49,250
about this is about Acme I was kind of

1110
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:52,190
shocked into reality here of so a domain

1111
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:54,530
parent without any indication

1112
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,690
notification of sub domains can always

1113
00:53:54,530 --> 00:54:01,580
be issued certificates for any subdomain

1114
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:03,290
and Acme allows this yes it'd be based

1115
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,930
on to see a policy for acne analysis and

1116
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:08,390
this is how public sees operation you

1117
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:09,919
can prove ownership of safe or calm but

1118
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:11,868
some see is anyway your public's here

1119
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,490
you you prove ownership before to come

1120
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:17,660
and then see a will happily issue you

1121
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:20,959
certificate with magenta fire for

1122
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,520
subdomain the 4.com if you prove control

1123
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,890
of dot-com can you be issued

1124
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,109
certificates for anything below no yes

1125
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:29,450
so it's really okay so if you read the

1126
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:30,920
browser CA if you if you were to see a

1127
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:32,660
browser forum guidelines

1128
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,420
it covers all this under see a browser

1129
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:37,430
forum guidelines today allow issuance or

1130
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:40,070
subdomain certs once you prove an

1131
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:42,890
ownership of parent main michael johnson

1132
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:44,630
anti-drugs point when she the way that

1133
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,759
you prove that control of the domain is

1134
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:49,010
such that you actually could if you were

1135
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,980
challenged prove control of any other

1136
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:55,270
name underneath that domain and so acme

1137
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:57,970
says well you proved your name is Doug I

1138
00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:01,220
don't need you to show do anything else

1139
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:02,118
you any you don't have to prove that

1140
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,669
your left leg

1141
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:04,290
belong

1142
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,910
also your left leg and your right leg is

1143
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,670
your right leg you're done it's all of

1144
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:12,240
you you're you've been offended right so

1145
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:15,090
that's the the point I'm unaware I was a

1146
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,680
little bit vague on this point okay it's

1147
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,140
interesting it simplifies some code that

1148
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,799
I have I'm not actually sure that let's

1149
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:25,049
encrypt actually does that right now

1150
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,760
okay it won't I mean it won't right so

1151
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:29,010
it's not you know and there have been

1152
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,420
discussions with let's encrypt board to

1153
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,910
see whether they'll change your policy

1154
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,100
to do this push right look so that's

1155
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,200
what I said so so with the exception

1156
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,569
that I have to prove every mean so I do

1157
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,009
a DNS chat or one challenge each time I

1158
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,450
actually a running code that does

1159
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:45,720
exactly what you're saying

1160
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:47,810
okay as for how does the pledge get his

1161
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:55,560
name well he doesn't see us again get

1162
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:58,230
the CSR attributes part and in the ACP

1163
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:02,040
context right we had the discussion this

1164
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:03,390
morning about the the RFC 22 name which

1165
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,490
is generated and returned the pledge

1166
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,740
puts that in someone wants to use

1167
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:09,419
Brustein in other context we're gonna

1168
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,370
have to decide that what you just said

1169
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,560
how does he how does the pledge decide

1170
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:15,450
what the name is going to be are there

1171
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:19,549
and generally registrar's supposed to

1172
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:23,460
tell it what to put in its in its CSR

1173
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:30,840
and that's that's an EST right so it's

1174
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:32,220
well it's not as well specified as you'd

1175
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,830
like because it's kind of like well of

1176
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:37,410
course you would know in est context

1177
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,480
because you authenticated the device and

1178
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,970
you're the thing and you knew who the

1179
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,620
guys thing was we went to LDAP or

1180
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:45,000
something whatever well you know what

1181
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,009
the name you're supposed to tell it put

1182
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,240
in and the device knows the name that's

1183
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,650
supposed to put in as well or the

1184
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,600
endpoint knows that because it

1185
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:54,000
authenticated with some other out of bad

1186
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,250
mechanism so it was all known by pre

1187
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,240
configuration and so now when we do this

1188
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:02,070
autonomically now we have to say ooh we

1189
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,810
don't know it by pre configuration so we

1190
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:06,300
have to find something out I'm not

1191
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:08,580
really real fond of this get CSR

1192
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:12,180
attributes or that's called sears our

1193
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:14,460
tributes return it's made up at the ASA

1194
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,859
one is made up it's the subject of one

1195
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,090
of the year otters about yes

1196
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:23,500
that someone thinks the a s the S one is

1197
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:25,910
nonsense and I had to implement it I

1198
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,170
found it very difficult to figure out

1199
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:30,980
what was wrong and I only really

1200
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:33,950
implemented it by changing my code until

1201
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:37,250
I produced the same output that the

1202
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:39,649
draft produced right so josh has an

1203
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,390
example no idea how it really works

1204
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:43,730
because I couldn't understand the ESN

1205
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:45,589
one and so I just kept fixing my code

1206
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:48,470
changing the nesting of sequences and

1207
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:50,450
sets until I got the same answer for the

1208
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:53,810
same inputs at which point I think it's

1209
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:55,430
correct but so that's good that example

1210
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:58,070
is there but I would be quite happy to

1211
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:00,109
have a completely different call that

1212
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,780
just gave me some Jason and you went

1213
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:05,960
even you're done right and that would

1214
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:08,270
probably work better with acne and maybe

1215
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,240
EMU would be happier with that too or I

1216
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:13,400
could have conceivably come in yeah

1217
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,680
so some reason it's a new cheap request

1218
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,410
and you get back a bit a little bit

1219
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,310
Jason it tells you RFC 822 name this

1220
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:24,649
thing you know blah blah blah whatever

1221
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:27,830
and I would be really I would be pleased

1222
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:30,950
and thrilled with that too as well to do

1223
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:37,190
that so I think it's great work and I'll

1224
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:40,250
be there tomorrow morning so I think I

1225
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:42,230
was lost in in in in the sequence of

1226
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,820
events a little bit so let me turn it

1227
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:47,410
around from right from the perspective

1228
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:50,180
of doing an na and I you know enrolling

1229
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:53,870
devices with a CP certificate so to

1230
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:56,089
speak with this RFC 822 names the the

1231
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:59,270
model how understood brewski so far is

1232
00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:01,400
that whatever you know protocol the

1233
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,470
Registrar uses with the certificate

1234
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,680
authority it would just have the you

1235
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:10,520
know however the RA is authenticating

1236
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,049
against the CA that's fine it's up to

1237
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,540
the protocol and then that's basically

1238
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,850
all the authentication that's done on

1239
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:19,670
that link which basically says that

1240
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:21,740
exactly as Michael mentioned CSR

1241
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:24,950
requests all the stuff that figures out

1242
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:27,919
what should be in the certificate

1243
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,720
signing request that's basically figured

1244
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,270
out between the RA and the client

1245
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,250
and that thing then goes to the CA and

1246
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,810
the CA simply signs off on that and says

1247
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,670
yeah fine I'll give you everything you

1248
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:40,340
want because you're a trusted RA I'm

1249
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,930
just trying to overemphasize what I

1250
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:44,360
thought to be the simple model so I'm

1251
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:46,779
very suspicious now that this actually

1252
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,100
is the model of of trust and

1253
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:53,230
verification validation between the RA

1254
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:55,460
and the CA in this F me case or or is it

1255
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:58,820
so you're saying that there's a trust

1256
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,800
relationship between the RA like the

1257
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,200
actually API request itself so tentacley

1258
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,690
between the API because the orient

1259
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,790
that's that that was my understanding

1260
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:10,250
also when talking long time ago now with

1261
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:12,230
with with Max that basically you need

1262
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,000
and that's also I think what I'll need

1263
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,350
to go back and figure out I thought I'd

1264
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,300
been written writing something about

1265
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:20,210
that in the ACP stuff I'm not quite sure

1266
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:23,780
but that's my mental model of the model

1267
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:26,870
between the RA ACP registrar call it and

1268
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:30,770
the CA that the CA blindly trust so to

1269
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:33,799
speak the RA to basically only send it

1270
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:35,900
you know signing request that the are

1271
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,610
because we've been basically coming from

1272
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,430
the premise that the back end from the

1273
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:44,270
RA to ca can use arbitrary protocols and

1274
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:48,169
we don't want the CA to do anything new

1275
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:50,240
specifically for a and I autonomic right

1276
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,100
so all this additional attribute crap

1277
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,169
that we're adding for the ACP is

1278
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,480
something the RA which is an ACP

1279
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,400
registra shouldn't be aware of control

1280
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,500
and do the right thing with it assign

1281
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:08,630
address field and so on but the CA

1282
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:10,280
doesn't need to care about it I'm not

1283
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:11,630
entirely sure exactly what this is in

1284
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:18,470
question is you're trying to ask me here

1285
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:22,490
but so the if I have an acne Ciera right

1286
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:25,220
and I'm trying to apply the Ani use case

1287
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:32,120
do I need any new code on the acne red

1288
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:34,009
on the acne CA I think so Interzone oh

1289
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:37,100
yeah me the reason the Taurus is

1290
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:40,120
confused is because he because you're

1291
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:42,790
thinking that this that the acne part

1292
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,100
changes the RA in some significant way

1293
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:47,380
and it doesn't all it's happening is

1294
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:52,540
that we have previously said that the

1295
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:54,520
are the Registrar has a CA within it or

1296
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,259
connected to it that's all we've said

1297
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,560
before we've never assumed anything else

1298
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:02,170
and Stefan is saying and if that

1299
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:05,560
connection is Acme this is what the

1300
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:09,960
whole story looks like okay and there

1301
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:13,230
are perhaps unresolved at this point

1302
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:16,560
additional requirements on the pledge

1303
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:18,990
because of the interaction with acne

1304
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,509
that's the point when is it suddenly

1305
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:24,700
something has changed in the registrar

1306
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:27,550
it's using acne rather than something

1307
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:32,140
else and now a third device the pledge

1308
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:34,030
has to change maybe maybe yeah okay and

1309
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:35,859
we're trying to establish that fact in

1310
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,360
this in this discussion depict it's not

1311
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,950
entirely clear to me yet because they

1312
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,860
haven't we haven't actually built this

1313
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,779
is whether whether the pledge needs to

1314
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:47,800
do anything special in formatting the

1315
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:49,900
csr to keep acne happy right but the Raa

1316
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:53,710
should be happy what what for example

1317
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:56,770
why why I use this dishes well because

1318
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:59,440
acne has acne has specific requirements

1319
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:01,750
on the format of the domain and how you

1320
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,160
do domain challenges which were kind of

1321
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,690
changing a little bit with the subdomain

1322
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,480
stuff but acne has specific requirements

1323
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,070
on how you do two main challenges and

1324
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,710
that means that the played you must know

1325
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:14,200
exactly which which domain to put in the

1326
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:16,060
CSR and a must correspond to the domain

1327
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:20,259
that the RA has previously verified

1328
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:22,090
right and and what that's why earlier I

1329
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:24,820
said what was missing in his in his

1330
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,530
state diagram was the get CSR because

1331
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,960
that actually provides the information

1332
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:31,150
the pledge probably needs and and if

1333
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,000
that's enough correct information then

1334
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:36,130
we're okay what Elliott has just pointed

1335
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,470
out to me that I have something wrong in

1336
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:40,330
my CSRs because I'm missing the binding

1337
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:41,919
of the TLS channel and the CSR and

1338
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:45,460
that's part of the issue and that may

1339
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:47,740
actually affect it acne may be upset

1340
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:49,960
about the TLS unique that's supposed to

1341
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,609
be in there so there may actually some

1342
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,040
other issues that back and forth with

1343
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,630
that CSR it has to come from the pledge

1344
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,779
we need it signed by the private key

1345
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:01,810
that's going to be attested to right so

1346
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,610
if I try to translate this then there is

1347
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:05,410
something like a domain stuff there

1348
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,470
needs to be some of the authentication

1349
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:10,810
on that if the pledge doesn't want to

1350
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:13,689
have very specific code on that the RA

1351
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:16,779
would give it through the csr attribute

1352
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:19,870
request to the client the client then

1353
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,880
issues the signing request and the acme

1354
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:23,650
CA can be happy something around that we

1355
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,180
take that's how it might work but we

1356
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,830
haven't worked out the details of

1357
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:29,169
whether that actually will keep back me

1358
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,850
happy into it and for tomorrow morning

1359
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:33,100
you hopefully have also invited some

1360
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,880
people who might know well we've given

1361
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,130
this presentation

1362
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,630
Arachne anima and we're giving it you

1363
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:39,400
tomorrow so hopefully he'll that we'll

1364
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:40,840
have enough people coming who will be

1365
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,250
able to answer the questions and the

1366
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,980
other thing we want to do is is aligned

1367
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,940
with what we thought is doing which is a

1368
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,110
different slant and it's a different

1369
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,910
take on this in a different take on how

1370
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:51,790
you might issue or use Acme to issue

1371
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:54,609
device ID service so as a working group

1372
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:56,500
chair the question in terms of what do

1373
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:59,550
you think which working group might be

1374
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:02,770
best suited to take on this work and why

1375
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:03,880
so it may be that the way the draft is

1376
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,340
currently structured needs to split

1377
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,260
apart because the Acme issue in the

1378
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:09,850
subdomain certs is a very distinct thing

1379
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,180
then he acne working group is happy to

1380
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:16,180
do and wants to do and for how you do

1381
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:20,049
the integration between acne and brewski

1382
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:22,270
or est that seems like it it's here okay

1383
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:25,120
and you mentioned others like t p-- and

1384
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:27,820
so on well tested their own working

1385
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,350
group to worry about in this so given

1386
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,790
this presentation tomorrow as well are

1387
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:32,560
very entities tomorrow at the EMU

1388
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:35,190
because if you look at the t p--

1389
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:37,870
specification deep covers how a

1390
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:40,090
supplicant can exchange because he is

1391
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:41,350
tens and sevens but a teep server but

1392
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,000
that's it it doesn't specify how the

1393
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:46,150
teep server interacts with the CA at all

1394
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,740
similar to brewski compression so and

1395
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,570
there's there's probably does more if it

1396
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,399
just possible there's a different set of

1397
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:53,080
the main challenges with teeth the

1398
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,660
answer is a brewski and we haven't

1399
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,130
looked at that at all yet so did I let

1400
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,410
me try to summarize so you're thinking

1401
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:01,330
the acne protocol stuff and what happens

1402
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:04,240
to the CA might be something for acne

1403
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:07,569
but they're not bothering about the

1404
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,218
finer details of mapping acne in an RA

1405
01:06:07,569 --> 01:06:11,650
into whatever other protocols the RA

1406
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:13,749
speaks and that might be better here it

1407
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:16,449
might be better here okay

1408
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:20,288
yeah and similar set of conversations

1409
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:23,199
will happen tomorrow at EMU so it may be

1410
01:06:20,289 --> 01:06:25,239
that well certainly the subdomain stuff

1411
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:28,630
probably warrants a draft and so

1412
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:30,219
interacting with the care and and it may

1413
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:33,430
be that the brewski and tip stuff

1414
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:42,339
require two servers documents we do not

1415
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:43,598
know but is your general in so Michael

1416
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:48,449
you said you're in strip in this is your

1417
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:52,749
any other interested in this work I mean

1418
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:57,339
why would we not want a standard you

1419
01:06:52,749 --> 01:06:59,859
know anima registrar to see a

1420
01:06:57,339 --> 01:07:01,660
connectivity and if what you're you've

1421
01:06:59,859 --> 01:07:02,979
been claiming is true that you know acne

1422
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,019
is the only thing that we have done in

1423
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:10,410
the ITF for that standard connection and

1424
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:10,410
I think we should be interested yes okay

1425
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:30,069
so twenty minutes to go way out to the

1426
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:34,719
fish yeah actually that's roughly cases

1427
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:38,109
we actually take you know almost double

1428
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:41,349
time so we had no more in other IT

1429
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:44,670
meeting because this I mean family right

1430
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:48,009
beginning we intentionally wrong anima

1431
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:50,469
every ITF of for two session but no made

1432
01:07:48,009 --> 01:07:55,779
the second setting is for the you know

1433
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:59,319
out of scope items to this meeting we

1434
01:07:55,779 --> 01:08:01,779
actually giving the stators we have you

1435
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:05,859
know the old charter and some potential

1436
01:08:01,779 --> 01:08:09,579
work items for new charter so we

1437
01:08:05,859 --> 01:08:14,410
actually have two sessions and so we use

1438
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:16,599
a 1000 if you still want to something so

1439
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,948
still have that no Michael said so so

1440
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:20,578
thank you actually organized this really

1441
01:08:17,948 --> 01:08:25,419
well I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the

1442
01:08:20,578 --> 01:08:27,399
whole day on anima you know I know you

1443
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:31,149
didn't decide when the sessions would be

1444
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:33,790
it happened and this room is smaller

1445
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:35,290
than I thought it was going to be so

1446
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,540
thank you did really well and extras

1447
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:41,679
really fun and pleasant so I think

1448
01:08:37,540 --> 01:09:58,780
that's a good and I hope we won't have

1449
01:08:41,679 --> 01:10:00,130
anybody who is not yet I mean he's going

1450
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,599
to find the best working group it

1451
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:03,940
doesn't mean anymore right so that's why

1452
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:06,280
I was asking and I think there I'm

1453
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:09,960
trying to be on top of that is even good

1454
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,960
enough so that we can have an opinion

1455
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,759
[Music]

1456
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:28,049
so once just maybe

1457
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:36,320
this is raised or security well this is

1458
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:38,240
not right so if I as a normal working

1459
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,190
group chair would like not to have to

1460
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,019
work right so my question would be then

1461
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:45,160
to the ACMA trace how much of this whole

1462
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,160
proxy functional
