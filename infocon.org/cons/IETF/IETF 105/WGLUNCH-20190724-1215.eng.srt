1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:21,769
okay is everybody settled in so this is

2
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:24,029
the working group chairs forum the the

3
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:25,859
pink half of the working group chairs

4
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,259
forum team at the top just realized that

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:41,700
I forgot to upload the chair slides so

6
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:44,010
music so we're going to start with this

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,480
this is an IETF meeting this is a note

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,370
well so anything all of the standard

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,779
rules of the note will apply you all are

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,280
working group chairs or leadership of

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,470
some for some form or another so I'm

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,150
sure you understand the note well the

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:04,559
next thing is administrative so the

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:06,090
agenda no no no not the education so

15
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,340
this is a agenda for the working group

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:16,049
chair forum for today is there any

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:18,119
agenda bashing okay with that

18
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:41,340
Heather are you ready there you are and

19
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:43,070
then I'm gonna miss you guys but but hey

20
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:49,130
guess what

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:52,259
[Applause]

22
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:58,710
do we need to turn the mic and no

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:02:00,720
microphone how's that okay um you all

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,289
may have heard that I'm working on

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,310
changing the RFC format is this a

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:13,410
surprise to anybody in this room you're

27
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:17,160
lyin okay so as a reminder primary goals

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,170
xml is the under changing underlying

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,549
format means you don't edit the document

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,470
once it's published it doesn't mean that

31
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,030
the vocabulary doesn't ever change ever

32
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,700
again the outputs will be text PDF a3

33
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,980
which is an archival target and HTML

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,810
there will be SVG no there won't be

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,850
color because color is stinkin hard and

36
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,250
non ASCII characters will be allowed all

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,260
of this has been described in sort of

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,630
the first rendition of set of

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:51,840
requirements documents from like RFC 791

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:54,859
2 7 9 9 8 or something like that we know

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,870
that what's in those documents may not

42
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,390
survive reality so there will be those

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,860
documents for all of them um I would

44
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,750
love to get those done before the end of

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,750
the year we'll see how that goes

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,420
now several moving parts need to align

47
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,950
but the RFC production center is working

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,530
very hard to make sure that they are

49
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:22,200
ready by the end of August of this year

50
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,700
to be published v3 documents there's

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,940
there's still a little bit of question

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,530
well the tools be quite ready and of

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,670
course the end end process at this point

54
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,080
you can submit v3 XML into the data

55
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:40,950
tracker and you know how many of them

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:43,410
there are 11 I think that's right 11

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,089
it's a small number now that said we are

58
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,620
also going to be converting v2 to v3

59
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,000
we're going to be able to do all these

60
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,310
things but the you all have to be ready

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,650
for it the iesg has to be ready for it

62
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,620
the RPC has to be ready for it so and

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,810
and I I still

64
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,230
we can get by the end of August we'll

65
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,230
see how it goes

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,489
expect several months of debugging

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,099
expect documents to take longer to get

68
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,480
published because the RFC editor is

69
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,250
going to be spending a lot of quality

70
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,289
time staring at this and we expect you

71
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,070
all to be spending some quality time

72
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,940
staring at the various outputs as well

73
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,830
there are a couple of URLs up there one

74
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,590
is sort of the just the high-level

75
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,789
checklist of what things do we need to

76
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,280
do and when do we expect to have them

77
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,710
done by for implementing from the RFC

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,388
editors perspective and another thing

79
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,440
and this is though if you get nothing

80
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:45,650
else out of me talking to you today

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:48,240
the FAQ XML to RFC v3 HTML go there

82
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,469
bookmark it make sure your folks have

83
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,530
seen it because it's going to answer a

84
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,870
lot of questions about how do i do or

85
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,948
what what does this mean or so on and so

86
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,690
forth and that will be a not not to get

87
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,430
into any other discussions it will be a

88
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,330
living document the way living documents

89
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,820
are intended so as we get more questions

90
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,229
we will be updating this but that's

91
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,880
that's probably one of the best

92
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:17,099
resources we're putting out right now

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:19,440
tell people know what to do in that FAQ

94
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:22,099
some of the highlights basics how to

95
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,990
create a draft using references because

96
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:28,020
guess what the RSC editor we really care

97
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,260
about those references use how to use

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,400
lists some finer points about C data as

99
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,979
special characters and just new and B 3

100
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:43,349
how do I do the following thing Krista

101
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:46,650
stuff right now the RPC is actively

102
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:48,949
training converting v2 files to be three

103
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,570
files asking people for input on that

104
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:54,210
the files are being reviewed by tools

105
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:58,830
developers and by volunteers on the XML

106
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:01,859
to RFC dev list the RPC will be sharing

107
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,599
files with authors that they've said you

108
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,099
know you seem friendly and willing to

109
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,990
work with us so please help us review

110
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:10,020
these things they won't get published as

111
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,090
v3 but but help us kick the tires on

112
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,979
what the process we think will look like

113
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:20,159
so if you you may hear from sandy and

114
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:25,960
Alice and crew as they they ask for

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,370
specific help a little more just

116
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,400
additional information what are we going

117
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,570
to expect in all 48 because when we get

118
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,179
to the point where we're ready to say we

119
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,400
are switching over what's in the off 48

120
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,930
queue as V 2 will be converted to V 3

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,690
files the RPC will do that the authors

122
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,350
that had perhaps already approved their

123
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,210
document

124
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,340
you know maybe 2 out of 3 authors have

125
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,530
approved it's not 3 off 48 yet with all

126
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,799
the approvals they're going to asked be

127
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,969
asked to review it again and redo their

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,620
approvals to make sure that we've got

129
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,380
this right

130
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,389
and then as I mentioned where we're

131
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:08,949
aiming to be ready to get this done by

132
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:11,830
the 28th of August the one other point I

133
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,320
threw in here so as I mentioned this is

134
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,820
going to mean documents take longer to

135
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,620
get published there's three where we

136
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,330
used to be looking at the text format

137
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,580
now we're looking at okay but this the

138
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,669
HTML right is the text right is the PDF

139
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,139
right is the new XML right so there's

140
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,260
definitely gonna be more work there and

141
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,970
because the gods are very unkind cluster

142
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,820
238 it's going to release about the same

143
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:42,419
time so we are absolutely expecting to

144
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,860
miss the service level agreement we are

145
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,799
working on getting what does that mean

146
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,900
documented working with the LLC board as

147
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,669
the consort of the holders of the

148
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,570
contract to make sure that the contracts

149
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,430
exceptions are discussed and if they are

150
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:02,010
granted that the it's granted with

151
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:05,820
limits and documented etc and I think

152
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,820
that was it for me

153
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:21,789
Heather Jim can you hear me almost kind

154
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,789
of you can always try the one closer

155
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,390
that's better

156
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:37,669
do we know yet when we're going to be

157
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,610
able to put v3 documents with things

158
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:43,728
like SVG on the data tracker and

159
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,839
actually see them that way that's a

160
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:51,320
really good question I don't know this

161
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,490
is Marie you said you're going to be

162
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,380
staring at this other parties will be

163
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,899
studying this we as raindrip chairs have

164
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,189
an opportunity to stare at this as well

165
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:04,160
what would you like us to look for

166
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:06,079
anything in particular I think one of

167
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,270
the key things would be looking at the

168
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:12,109
output is the output what you expect to

169
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,569
see there's there's new ways to do

170
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,190
things like lists and tables do those

171
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:24,589
things look like you would expect them

172
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:26,029
to look other questions comments I'm

173
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:31,060
looking at sandy and Alice in the back

174
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:32,300
did I did I lie at any point am I good

175
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,699
okay

176
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,410
Benedict so I know in the past you've

177
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,120
talked about having us try to look at

178
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,640
the actual external sources because

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,720
that's the authoritative copy yes but

180
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,050
then we're gonna have you the new

181
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,770
generated HTML mm-hmm does it make sense

182
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,959
to also look at the raw HTML as opposed

183
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,260
to loading it up in a browser or other

184
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,770
rendering environment if you if you'd

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,350
like bonus points and gold stars sure

186
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:04,520
but that was never in my head for y'all

187
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,520
to have to do at least from my

188
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:12,920
perspective and perhaps it's a bit naive

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,209
with the HTML it's what you see that's

190
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,270
going to be particularly important with

191
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,250
that because the it's the XML that's

192
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,779
it's like the normative language and

193
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,779
being transformed and everything so

194
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:32,510
any other questions for me okay

195
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:39,550
thank you very much I believe the agenda

196
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:44,620
next just put the agenda back up okay

197
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,829
I'm buds team was it Melinda or Pete Oh

198
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,960
Barry

199
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:55,060
Oh Barry's gonna go first okay yeah this

200
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,830
would be very quick I spoke with y'all

201
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,199
IETF 104 try to remember which number is

202
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,310
which and I wanted to just give a quick

203
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,800
follow-up on that about behavior of

204
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:12,170
behavior in your working groups and our

205
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,140
request to you to help us make it better

206
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,050
so the message we want to give you is

207
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,480
that the the message we want to give the

208
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,400
community is that the IETF community as

209
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,230
a whole does not accept insulting

210
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,930
abusive unprofessional behavior that

211
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,850
sort of thing and we expect to be

212
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,010
treated respectfully even during strong

213
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,260
disagreement we would like you as

214
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,500
working group chose to help the iesg get

215
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:40,610
that message to the community and be

216
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,310
more alert to that kind of behavior be

217
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:48,350
more quick to react to it and more firm

218
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:50,030
in reacting to it phase it out if it

219
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,910
happens on the mailing list start with a

220
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:55,430
private conversation move to a public

221
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,110
conversation if that's necessary but

222
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,660
it's also important to make sure that

223
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,110
the community knows that something's

224
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:07,850
being done and that this behavior is not

225
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:10,550
part of what the community accepts so

226
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,820
we're behind you we will help you with

227
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,979
it we'd like you to be very active in in

228
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,340
pushing this down to the community and

229
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,860
if needed we are looking at ways to get

230
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,070
some resources for techniques to help

231
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,240
you and that sort of thing so this isn't

232
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,310
the last word you're going to hear from

233
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,870
the iesg about it but now you're going

234
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,869
to hear some stuff from the Ombuds team

235
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:58,100
so Melinda said that she will what her

236
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,750
two cents in as we go along here so I

237
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:05,730
expect many of you are aware that some

238
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,700
of the ietf nameless discussion has

239
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:13,200
generated heat in addition to light and

240
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,730
some of that heat is a little hot so

241
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,370
we've been talking for some time about

242
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,210
what you all can do to help

243
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:25,110
we the Ombuds team and some folks from

244
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:28,140
the isg had a meeting on Wednesday know

245
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,450
Monday Monday Monday at lunch thank you

246
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,710
it's such a long week the other

247
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:36,900
Wednesday with some folks and we're

248
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,540
looking to bring in other resources

249
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:44,329
professional resources to sort of help

250
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:48,689
with this we understand that none of us

251
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:52,290
in leadership and none of you as chairs

252
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,500
in general have been hired on the basis

253
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:59,579
of your wonderful and incredible HR

254
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,800
management abilities we are all in the

255
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,440
same boat we learn as we go some of us

256
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,150
have more experience some less but we

257
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,580
want to start to give you some ideas

258
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,740
some hints about how to go forward and

259
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,650
how to manage your groups that will help

260
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,870
this along and as you have questions

261
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,610
bring them up and you can do that on the

262
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,200
working group chairs list you can do

263
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,230
that directly to the Ombuds team if it's

264
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,780
touchier you can certainly do that with

265
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,670
your AEDs and your ADEs are learning

266
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,920
along with you do not feel like you're

267
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,860
cut off in space here as the poor little

268
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,770
person who doesn't know so Barry

269
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,460
mentioned this business about on list

270
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:40,650
off list kinds of things there are

271
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,190
techniques that you can use that will

272
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,770
help this along the main problem that

273
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,060
I've seen so far is a lot of

274
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,870
inconsistency

275
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:55,469
which is people start acting a little

276
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:58,040
rambunctious and it gets let go and then

277
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,250
it gets let go a little further and then

278
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,810
chair whoever panic sets in oh my god I

279
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,750
have to do something about this this has

280
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:11,489
gotten out of hand and then the action

281
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,350
start to look arbitrary so you want to

282
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,780
start those conversations as someone is

283
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,860
getting a little heated maybe awfulest

284
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:24,209
drop a note say let's just make sure to

285
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:27,420
keep this in check and one of the nice

286
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:30,180
things you can do is get that person on

287
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,709
board with you we want to show other

288
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,959
folks in the group especially the new

289
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,170
folks that this is not the way to go it

290
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,090
would be ever so nice if you a person

291
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,829
who did this little offense would post

292
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,270
and say you know what I got a little

293
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,340
heated there sorry about that

294
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:48,870
let's try that again without as much

295
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:53,370
rambunctiousness you can do that it's

296
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,940
also very important to do the same kinds

297
00:15:53,370 --> 00:16:00,540
of things in your working group sessions

298
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:03,090
we consistently see chairs who sit up at

299
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,610
the table and are not paying attention

300
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,320
to what's going on at the mics it's well

301
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,460
they're having a conversation I'll let

302
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,690
it go until it gets out of control and

303
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,150
generally speaking you have a second

304
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,560
chair you can whisper to your second

305
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,020
chair could you go whisper in that

306
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,750
person's ear maybe next time they get to

307
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,420
the mic they should calm it down a bit

308
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,460
you need to do active management in the

309
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,120
room you need to do active management on

310
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,370
the list and it's hard and like I said

311
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,650
we're gonna try and come up with more

312
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:40,080
ideas tools Pacheco chair of the network

313
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:43,500
coding research group where we had a

314
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,600
major problem of violence that was

315
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,390
actually directed that the chairs and

316
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,240
the participants we tried to take it

317
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:55,050
offline we try to get it off list we try

318
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,700
to get it off or persons the problem is

319
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,790
the lists are not the only ways that

320
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,980
people use to get to us there is also

321
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,420
the LinkedIn there's Facebook

322
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,849
there's all kinds of other ways that

323
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,430
this is the person who has the bad

324
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:11,909
behavior may use all kinds of other

325
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,860
things I have absolutely to thank the

326
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,780
people in the IETF who actually helped

327
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,119
us because I wasn't point there was

328
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,379
threats of violence and the Boston

329
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:24,119
Police was involved and I agreed that

330
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,510
there is a lot of things that you should

331
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,699
do but I think we're basically

332
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,920
nonviolent people and when people start

333
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,800
having bad behavior we'll let it go

334
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,400
because we do not want to confront the

335
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,580
person and I don't know if there are

336
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,600
ways to do that in our case it really

337
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,159
got bad and it's actually the fun you

338
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,290
think that you know when we were in the

339
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,580
middle of it which was last year we were

340
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,320
told that it was not the first time

341
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,620
which I found was amazing because I

342
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,120
thought we were so you know out of it

343
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,120
but I would say I agree with all with

344
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,550
what you said but I think I don't know

345
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,540
how that can be done but sometimes

346
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:09,180
within the group you will not have the

347
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,820
resources because we're involved we know

348
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:15,390
the person in our case we knew the

349
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,280
person from other activities I think I

350
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,950
don't know if there's a way to have some

351
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,740
kind of link in between the groups when

352
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,970
you start having someone who is

353
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,820
completely out of it

354
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:30,000
but for us we tried everything you said

355
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,980
we confronted the person we confronted

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,290
the person personally we confronted the

357
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,320
person via Skype we confronted the

358
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:42,240
person and actually every time it was

359
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,250
getting worst so this is my comment I

360
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,230
think everything you said I think works

361
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,510
well if you think that people are fairly

362
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,490
rational right in our case we were

363
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,300
dealing with somebody who was completely

364
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,720
irrational and and I think this is a

365
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,129
excellent point

366
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,480
and something that we should all keep in

367
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:04,110
mind there is no time at which it's too

368
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,040
early to escalate okay right that you

369
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:12,020
know the ADEs are there we are we as the

370
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:16,090
Ombuds team are here and they're

371
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,908
escalating to quickly can't happen right

372
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,039
someone someone does something and it

373
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,470
gets to us and we say you know what not

374
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,559
time to escalate yet no big deal with

375
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,049
that but yeah having the ability to have

376
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,220
the community certainly asking questions

377
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:33,190
of other chairs on the working group

378
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,020
chairs list is fine but that one sounds

379
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,380
like and eventually you got to you just

380
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,750
had to escalate all the way up and I

381
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,210
think no one should be worried about

382
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,529
doing that no one should feel like they

383
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,890
have to do any of this on their own

384
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:50,549
that's that that's the worst possible

385
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:55,330
outcome we do need to act as a community

386
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:56,529
so yeah I don't want to minimize exactly

387
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,418
what you were talking about by saying

388
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,090
they're all these little tools that's

389
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:04,570
for the general case and we all know

390
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,428
that we I mean we have hit multiple of

391
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,158
those cases on although physical

392
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:12,399
violence is really rare to be threatened

393
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:15,580
but thankfully but yeah it has to be

394
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:17,709
dealt with quickly jeff has so I want us

395
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,039
to share some experience from other

396
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,200
mailing list context that I have done

397
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,158
moderated other listened various forms

398
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,299
within the people that are very

399
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,520
hot-headed hungry hot topics and it's

400
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:32,950
been my experience that when things have

401
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,200
started you know heating up past a

402
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,720
certain point the feedback cycle of it

403
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,080
being semi real-time is what tends to

404
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,909
cause things to go a little bit crazy

405
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,740
you know everybody that is running a

406
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,750
mailing list any of your their chairs

407
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,149
have you know log in for a mailman to be

408
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,070
able to manage your mail lists have

409
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:53,110
minimally a tool on there that's called

410
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,928
emergency moderation you can click this

411
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,899
button and every bit of mail to the list

412
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,029
just stops you you can at that point

413
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:03,489
control which ones actually go through

414
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:06,010
and if necessary you can selectively

415
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,130
moderate people this is not saying your

416
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,408
job is to censor the people but just

417
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,899
simply by introducing that delay and the

418
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:15,190
responses things sometimes can get

419
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:18,129
better on their own

420
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,320
Suresh mentioned directly that he did

421
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,710
this as a chair with one working group

422
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,080
and the effective tool for him was he

423
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,240
turned on moderation completely and then

424
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,639
went to the individuals and said

425
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm moderating this do you really want

426
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,260
me to post this as is and he said he got

427
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,559
a pretty good response of a lot of

428
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,020
people saying no that's okay

429
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,360
and this is the thing I mean I think

430
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,720
most of the participants are rational

431
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,459
and will respond well and some of them

432
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,720
will continue to be hot-headed and will

433
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,049
need to deal with them in a different

434
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,110
way but yeah I moderating the list you

435
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:58,309
are completely empowered to do one of

436
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,990
the other things you should note that

437
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,510
you are completely empowered to do is

438
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,720
during a working group session refuse

439
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,770
the mic to someone if someone is getting

440
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,370
out of control

441
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,408
you can have them sit down and say

442
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:16,010
that's it you're not getting up to the

443
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:18,080
mic again and that's a 24 18 you can

444
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,100
refuse them the floor perfectly

445
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,168
reasonable if they're getting out of

446
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,668
control

447
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:24,710
Benedick I was also talking to Suresh

448
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:27,350
and just to point out that the caveat to

449
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,179
that is that it only stops traffic to

450
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,830
the list so if a message is sent to the

451
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,750
list and the other person they're being

452
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,100
hot-headed with the individual the

453
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,529
single copy still goes to the other

454
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,789
individual and it's just be aware of

455
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,169
that you know yes this is a very

456
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,270
effective tool but there's a caveat

457
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:44,149
right and mentioning to the person who

458
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,918
got cc'd by the way the it didn't make

459
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:50,600
it to the list of perhaps responding is

460
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,190
not the best plan yeah and this is Barry

461
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,469
just pointing out you can also moderate

462
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,270
individuals as well as doing the

463
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,270
emergency moderation of the whole lists

464
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,080
so when Melinda and I were talking we

465
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,629
thought this would be sort of freeform

466
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,580
do you have any questions of approaches

467
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,539
do you want to talk about particular

468
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:15,020
instances name names don't name names

469
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:17,658
whatever you like but we are being

470
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,399
recorded and we are being you know we

471
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,399
are being NIDA code and all that stuff

472
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:27,590
one thing I want to highlight is it it's

473
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,450
okay for people to be angry and it's

474
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,820
okay for them to express that anger that

475
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:36,350
doesn't need to be stopped that's when

476
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,908
they're abusive and hostile and causing

477
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,770
other people to be abusive and hostile

478
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:42,520
because we know that participants do

479
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,920
model other participants behavior

480
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,350
that there needs to be an intervention

481
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,790
so it's not the anger and I you know I

482
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,889
think that a lot of people here are

483
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,780
actually capable and do frequently

484
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,809
express anger in a very straightforward

485
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,170
way and that's that's good so one point

486
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,170
of clarification

487
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,520
Jones cutter um seriously you mentioned

488
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,210
that you can refuse somebody to the

489
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,590
floor and and not necessarily looking

490
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,990
for answer to this or anything but I

491
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,209
just want to point out that it's it's

492
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,960
all very well to say that you know we

493
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,730
have the formal authority to do that but

494
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,230
probably most of us certainly I have

495
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,600
encountered more than once the case

496
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,420
where some of these filibustering and

497
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,800
won't sit down and you know sometimes it

498
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,929
you know turns into a shouting match

499
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,260
between the chair and the person who's

500
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:40,059
filibustering I wonder if it might help

501
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,590
to have a mic cut button although you

502
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:44,020
know it's it's tempting to always have a

503
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:48,419
technological solution to a human

504
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:53,290
problem so I an earlier conversation

505
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:56,140
reminded me of this you should have come

506
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,639
if you are finding contentious meetings

507
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,559
right that you're running contentious

508
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,679
meetings you should have the

509
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,280
conversation with your ad upfront right

510
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:09,210
you aren't power to do that but you need

511
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:13,210
absolute unequivocal backup from your ad

512
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:16,690
to pull that off so when you say John

513
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,370
sit down you're done at the mic and the

514
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,770
person keeps going and you say it the

515
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,570
second time by the third time your ad

516
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,600
should be standing up and going

517
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:29,320
this is John's call he is chairing this

518
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,240
meeting you need to sit down now and if

519
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,500
that person is you know sufficiently

520
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,240
disruptive well yeah well you know there

521
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,240
is the point where someone becomes so

522
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,679
recalcitrant that outside means need to

523
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,650
be taken hopefully we never get there

524
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:52,090
and the meeting venues have security

525
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,919
staff but but I mean and and this is

526
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,559
again you know to nooria's point

527
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,179
yeah people go over the top and and

528
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,700
we have to deal with that with security

529
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,600
staff with police with whatever for the

530
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,769
most part

531
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,600
luckily that's not gonna be the case and

532
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:10,360
and the comment can be you need to sit

533
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,248
down until you know you're not being

534
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,658
abusive anymore and we can talk after

535
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:16,450
the meeting about this or whatever and

536
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:18,009
also try and keep your cool about it

537
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,450
because it gets harder and harder the

538
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:24,309
more amped up you get so with respect to

539
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,679
moderating specific users understanding

540
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:32,049
making to the emergency moderation thing

541
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:34,360
we have somewhere in the RFC 2007 is on

542
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:36,340
a list did that change recently so

543
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,649
what's the difference between that

544
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,240
process and what you just described

545
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:42,279
where you can actually flag I'm gonna

546
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,720
moderate that person wondering the whole

547
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,999
list is probably something you can get

548
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,529
away with in a crisis but if moderating

549
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:50,529
one person we have a process for that to

550
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:54,220
take steps to get to so what's due no no

551
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:56,590
the the steps for moderating one person

552
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,240
what moderating is not a problem at all

553
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,340
because that person's posts are still

554
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,289
being made now you want to cut that

555
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,490
person off and say you are not posting

556
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,869
anymore don't care what that's the

557
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,970
distinction okay then you have to start

558
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:09,039
the process but that process for the

559
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,749
chair to do for 30 days is actually

560
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,309
relatively simple oh yeah there's

561
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:13,570
notifications and that's it I'm

562
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:15,369
wondering if it's like I don't know

563
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,908
appealable that I cut you off because

564
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:21,279
you're disrupting a conversation and but

565
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:24,490
I didn't run through that process so not

566
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,320
not for the instant moderation I'm gonna

567
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,019
put you in the queue and I will look at

568
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,559
the post before it goes no okay that's

569
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,559
not a problem

570
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:38,169
Collin Parkins just on the the meeting

571
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,179
management side I've seen working groups

572
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:43,539
that have post the meeting and taken a

573
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:44,679
10-minute break carefully so it on the

574
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,658
meeting management's I've seen working

575
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,009
groups take a pause and take a 10-minute

576
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:51,809
break in the middle to let things come

577
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:51,809
down which is sometimes a good approach

578
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:59,110
alright thank you very much since

579
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:04,600
there's nobody in the queue we will move

580
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:07,418
on thank you guys so next you will all

581
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,980
have seen a question Michele posts the

582
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,950
mailing list and she's going to come and

583
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:16,070
gather some real-time

584
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:23,480
be back on or not now for something much

585
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:26,240
more fun working yes

586
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,299
I'm Rochelle cotton I'm with Diana and

587
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,830
yes I did post a question to the list we

588
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:37,370
did get a suggestion about having a

589
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:40,250
maybe a short little video directed at a

590
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:44,209
working group chair on helpful hints for

591
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:47,570
how to do something related to your Ana

592
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,549
considerations and it got us thinking a

593
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,269
little bit more we wanted to open up the

594
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:56,210
discussion to you all and not

595
00:28:53,269 --> 00:29:01,159
necessarily get the feedback today but

596
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:02,919
at least get you thinking as you review

597
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:06,919
documents in your working group

598
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:10,820
especially new ones coming in is there

599
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,850
any type of resource any type of

600
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,529
material maybe it is a short little

601
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,649
video maybe it's something else

602
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:20,779
that would help you either you and your

603
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:23,449
in your position as working group chair

604
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:27,649
or something you can say to one of your

605
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:32,630
authors go watch this go look at this we

606
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:36,168
do have RFC 8126 it is a beast

607
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:40,010
maybe it's dissecting some of that into

608
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:45,130
some more useful material breaking it

609
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:49,789
down into little pieces one thing that

610
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:52,909
we we do that we're trying to actually

611
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:56,899
have done earlier in the process is when

612
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:58,820
we get last call announcements that is

613
00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:01,879
often the first time we're looking at

614
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,220
documents and in those documents there

615
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,220
could be a request for some parameters

616
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:10,850
in an expert review registry and so at

617
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:14,960
that time we initiate the expert review

618
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:17,418
and sometimes it's a little bit late

619
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,879
sometimes maybe there's no expert for

620
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:22,220
that registry and so it takes time to

621
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:23,750
get the expert aside and then get the

622
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,580
request to them

623
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,550
sometimes the experts can take a little

624
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,850
while so we've been trying to figure out

625
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:35,210
how we can try to move that a little bit

626
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,730
of review earlier into the process if

627
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:43,820
you have any any ideas on that we would

628
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:47,090
love to hear them also many of you deal

629
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:50,360
with requesting early allocation of code

630
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:52,939
points for the most part that's been

631
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,439
working well but if you still have

632
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,780
questions about that or there's

633
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,410
something we can do better again we'd

634
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:04,730
like that feedback just looking at my

635
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:07,150
notes here I think that's mostly at

636
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:12,800
Barry and I are working on an update to

637
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:15,320
8126 to add in a few things and fix a

638
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,760
couple areas in there so if there's

639
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,980
something that you feel like is

640
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,150
violently missing from there we would

641
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,790
also like to hear that so either in

642
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,890
person here or if you want to go back

643
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,920
and think about it and as you're working

644
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,530
please send us email or to the working

645
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,420
group chairs list where we're just happy

646
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,790
to listen so we can kind of focus our

647
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:42,170
energy on getting something that's

648
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:44,210
useful for you guys I'm sure that

649
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,260
noticeable follow-up was just really

650
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:51,260
made only list which is much as we

651
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:53,120
respect to value the work of Ayana many

652
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,540
considerations are often one of the last

653
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,820
things the authors get to so what I was

654
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,970
going to suggest on the squish cream in

655
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,840
here was in the same way that we have

656
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:08,270
templates for for draft write-ups if

657
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,629
there are common cases are the common

658
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,879
cases

659
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,120
Ayana sees where if the authors were

660
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,160
just used this text every time I Anna

661
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,169
wouldn't have to spend time parsing

662
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,430
Putt Putt parson but the author what the

663
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,090
author meant with this interesting

664
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,230
choice of words

665
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:26,629
so like templates yeah but templates

666
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,490
mean the thinking is look if the author

667
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,220
Isaac if lots of runs using a clever

668
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,810
with a brand new registry go read 8126

669
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,610
and and stop complaining

670
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,740
however they just want to do something

671
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,199
routine just out

672
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,280
ketta point if you had a template what

673
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,720
might you might start seeing the

674
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,178
template takes coming back every time

675
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,520
and it's one glance okay I okay

676
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,559
the I interview is exactly the author

677
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,910
wanted as opposed to oh you left that

678
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:50,800
name in the registry or wait a minute

679
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,929
you need to so if you have common cases

680
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,730
where you're wasting time on simple

681
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,530
stuff and you provide some templates so

682
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,570
the cut and paste cut case fill in the

683
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,460
blanks that might have that might speed

684
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,570
things up everybody and I should mention

685
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:07,920
that in RFC 8126 there is a link to

686
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:12,820
another document that actually has some

687
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:16,059
template type style information that

688
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,950
document is fairly hidden on our website

689
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:20,500
because we didn't have a really great

690
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,660
place to put it but it but it in group

691
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,890
chairs wiki could be a good home for the

692
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:32,800
relevant content down in the suggestion

693
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:35,140
box this is bad let me ask all of you

694
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,700
are how many of you regularly use the

695
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:43,480
working group chairs wiki for something

696
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:48,460
so unfortunately few and that's yeah

697
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:51,610
please more just one let's go what David

698
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,740
said but what actually happens is the

699
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,320
author has 30 minutes to a submission

700
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,590
deadline and tries to fill in the INR

701
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,639
considerations and typically what they

702
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,020
do is they find in RFC that that

703
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,060
registers something similar and copy it

704
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:13,480
over right which means they they often

705
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,460
propagate bad practices that exist first

706
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,609
and what deadlines are you referring to

707
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:26,590
the internet draft submission deadlines

708
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:31,710
and then I never touched again okay we

709
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:34,659
we see the document most often during

710
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:37,109
IETF last call yes and there's lots of

711
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:40,419
time before that yes

712
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:43,540
so having having just shipped another

713
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:45,509
document DNA considerations coming back

714
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,350
from the EAD

715
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:50,690
I think it would be nice to have a few

716
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:54,118
samples I'm not talking about templates

717
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:59,040
samples of any reservations that are

718
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:07,910
good to copy so if a particular registry

719
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:12,420
like media types had a pointer to two

720
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:14,460
registrations that are good to copy okay

721
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,140
thank you so so Michelle we talked about

722
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,730
this this is Dave waltemeyer we talked

723
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,290
about this briefly earlier in the week

724
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,630
you know I'm a programmer I think about

725
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:26,310
things and design patterns you know a

726
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:28,770
lot of the IANA registrations you know

727
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,869
tend to follow some fairly common you

728
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:34,109
know patterns it might be useful to

729
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:37,020
organize templates and some some

730
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:41,009
guidance around you know developing an

731
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,720
Diana registry and to follow certain

732
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,670
common patterns you know things like

733
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,240
this is a register that's how you do a

734
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:51,180
registry of registries this is how you

735
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,100
do a simple indexed registry you know

736
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,740
that that has a name and an index number

737
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,160
you know you know things that that are

738
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:02,250
sort of repeating concepts that exist in

739
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,310
a lot of a lot of drafts we might even

740
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,050
be able to you know take a look at you

741
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,119
do it do a brief survey and see where

742
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,460
there's a lot of commonality across you

743
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,640
know drafts and try to develop a

744
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,280
shortlist of design patterns to focus on

745
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,430
first and in in that document that I

746
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,130
mentioned that's linked from 8126 we do

747
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:26,790
have some of those very frequently used

748
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:29,400
samples you know often there a number

749
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:32,250
column a description column and a

750
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,910
reference or some some variation of that

751
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,800
so we can look at that more and see how

752
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,230
we can present it the other way and

753
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,330
incidentally I was looking at 8126 the

754
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:46,020
other day and I couldn't find that so

755
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:49,049
there you can find the example a there's

756
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,700
a link in there yeah yeah yeah so

757
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,310
anything we could do to make that more

758
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:56,200
obvious really helpful yeah great thank

759
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,599
you this is Robert

760
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,210
sparks I'm going to bring the

761
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:05,140
conversation back to the point that you

762
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,880
made about trying to push recognizing

763
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,190
that expert review needs to happen

764
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,730
impossibly initiating that expert review

765
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:15,880
earlier in the process I wonder if it

766
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:19,030
would be possible to develop a culture

767
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,930
in working groups across working groups

768
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,670
where there's an expectation on authors

769
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,828
to put in there I in a consideration

770
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,540
section even if they are pasting it in

771
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:31,839
at the very last minute before the draft

772
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,970
submission an explicit statement about

773
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,140
whether or not the registry they're

774
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:41,430
touching needs expert review so we train

775
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:45,848
them train the individual authors to

776
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:48,490
learn how to know whether or not an

777
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:51,940
expert review needs to happen so that

778
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:54,459
they know how to put this in it's in and

779
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,230
it can you know we can I don't want to

780
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,579
dive too deep in and the mechanics the

781
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,800
draft would need to have something where

782
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,810
he didn't end up lying around in the RSC

783
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,550
at the end so it could be in in the you

784
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,589
know RFC editor please remove this kind

785
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,810
of kind of bracket but we just set the

786
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:09,220
expectation that when these drafts come

787
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,509
in when they're you know when when

788
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,459
they're submitted is working group

789
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,740
drafts anything anytime it's touching a

790
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,369
registry there is a sentence in there

791
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,319
that the author populates saying this

792
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:24,700
requires expert reviewer does not

793
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:27,400
require expert review so definitely a

794
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:32,470
kind of a culture change there on what

795
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:34,150
we expect authors to be doing may think

796
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,770
a little bit about whether there's some

797
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,410
type of resource we could provide that

798
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,040
working group chairs could point authors

799
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:45,339
to and say hey before you are asking me

800
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,310
to do a final review if your document

801
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:52,150
touches any I Anna stuff go look at this

802
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,560
or watch this or read this and that

803
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,930
would be maybe one of those check marks

804
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,869
on there Robert what would be the

805
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:03,810
difference in what happens if the author

806
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:07,560
does that the

807
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:09,810
would learn ahead of time there is a

808
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,700
barrier to having my RSC published that

809
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,890
that you know he might not otherwise

810
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,140
have learned until the thing was in the

811
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,390
is G's hand and he is G member figured

812
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,540
it out the chair who might not have been

813
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,549
paying attention might see this line in

814
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,140
this thing you know don't address the

815
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,450
mission and say oh well I should cue

816
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,609
that up and be watching for the point

817
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,410
maybe I can kick this expert review off

818
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,210
like right before working group last

819
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,830
call or during working group last call

820
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,800
or if it looks like it's something

821
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:39,240
gnarly I can get an early review so that

822
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,280
make sure that our groups not going

823
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:47,180
completely into a place we're going to

824
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:52,950
have to crawl out of layer John Scudder

825
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:55,169
so to the earlier comment that you know

826
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,910
stuff gets pasted in 30 minutes before

827
00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:00,090
the the deadline and then never touched

828
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:04,230
again if it's never touched again that

829
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:07,200
means that the document shepard is also

830
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,450
kind of calling it in because there's

831
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,640
like a specific thing in the document

832
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,169
shepard guidelines that says you know

833
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,870
the document shepherd has reviewed the

834
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:20,280
Ayana section and you know thinks that

835
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:23,790
it's not broken so you know number one i

836
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,380
guess you know for us we should probably

837
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,509
make sure that our document shepherds

838
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,540
are actually reviewing those ino

839
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,220
sections i personally when acting as

840
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,050
document shepherd have pretty much

841
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:38,189
completely rewritten more than one of

842
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:40,470
those i'm afraid and and i think

843
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,060
something you would you know earlier you

844
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,640
were talking about trading materials

845
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:48,060
templates where do we link those from

846
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,339
etc and it might be productive to stick

847
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,460
a link right there in the document

848
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,200
shepherd template that says over here is

849
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,520
where the templates are just in case you

850
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,730
need to rewrite somebody's i anna

851
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:05,759
section rate i'm also a mini type of

852
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,620
viewer there are plenty of terrible

853
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,180
examples of what you should submit so

854
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,700
please don't copy those the problem is

855
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,350
of course someone writing up a template

856
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,799
doesn't know if what they're looking at

857
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,970
is a bad example things change over time

858
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,040
of what we're prepared to accept the

859
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:22,009
role or not so anything we can do to

860
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,870
arrange to encourage authors to approach

861
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,440
reviewers early and say designated

862
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:28,520
experts for the other des in the room

863
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,140
first can you identify that who a

864
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,250
reviewer should be and secondly what you

865
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,350
please take an early look at this

866
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,610
because if I can avoid a round trip with

867
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,100
you because all round trips sometimes

868
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,320
take a while you should try to avoid

869
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,180
those so yeah I definitely encourage

870
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,280
that anything we can do to smooth that

871
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,290
process out we get a lot at a crap and

872
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,520
the might and then mind types reviewers

873
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:51,590
and we have to do two or three round

874
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:55,280
trips we know to add on what Marie said

875
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:57,020
we also offer early review at any point

876
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,140
in time too you don't have to wait till

877
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,120
last call to review a document so if as

878
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,740
working your chairs you see a document

879
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,470
and you're like oh my gosh this section

880
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:09,470
is absolutely awful and you know you can

881
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:12,919
also tell them hey go contact Diana and

882
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:17,629
and they're gonna help you to improve

883
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,820
your section one thing I do notice at

884
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:22,400
IETF meetings is that we are getting

885
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,220
more authors coming to us at the table

886
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
to say this is what I want to do how do

887
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,060
I do it

888
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,830
and when their document goes through

889
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,299
there's a lot less pain because they've

890
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,390
already done it the right way from the

891
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,250
very beginning so you can always tell

892
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:43,520
them to contact us early and we can help

893
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:45,800
too Brian Rosen - two things by far the

894
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,290
most common I an action is added add a

895
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,060
value to a registry we could automate

896
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,230
that right you know what the shape of

897
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,970
the registry is so you know what the

898
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:56,600
values are so you could put up we could

899
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:59,930
put something in XML RFC which is an add

900
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,940
a value function that you know pull down

901
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,509
what registry you're doing and you know

902
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,510
fill it all in

903
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,500
all right so so so so clearly there are

904
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:16,820
registers for which that wouldn't work

905
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,740
but the night 90% would help a lot I I

906
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,690
will I will spend time with you on that

907
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,930
because I I've done this not in

908
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:26,240
isolation that's right on on expert

909
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:29,240
review possibly what we need is a small

910
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:33,080
amount more formalism maybe an expert

911
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:36,589
ends with some token just the URI is

912
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,830
good enough on a tool and that token can

913
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,260
be included in the draft which is I

914
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,299
Anna's indication that expert review has

915
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:51,620
already been done where we're working on

916
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:53,840
that barber start so while we're on the

917
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,700
topic of expert review but coming at it

918
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,590
from the other side of things you know

919
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,960
you and I have traded emails where I

920
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:03,640
actually try and come from broadband

921
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:08,780
forum and try to get I ana stuff and

922
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,190
it's takes forever you know fortunately

923
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,440
I know that it's going to take forever

924
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,880
so I start several months in advance so

925
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,670
when it takes a month and a half to

926
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,770
finally get an expert review but I'm

927
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:23,630
wondering him has there been any

928
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:25,520
progress on what all has to trigger an

929
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,650
expert review because we discussed you

930
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,730
know if I just want to change the URL

931
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:35,090
that my registered item is pointing to

932
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,160
if it says this is you know this

933
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:40,070
registry requires expert review then

934
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,100
changing the URL requires expert review

935
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,860
and if that expert is going to take four

936
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:51,680
weeks to take a look at that new URL

937
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:53,240
then it's four weeks to change a URL and

938
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,710
I don't know if there's been any

939
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,589
progress on trying to maybe get when

940
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:03,050
people say we're creating a new registry

941
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,990
and it requires expert review can there

942
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,910
be some limiting of you know maybe these

943
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:09,859
things if they're changed don't require

944
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:11,500
expert review or things like that I

945
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,690
think that's perfectly acceptable

946
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:18,800
acceptable to put in as instructions to

947
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,610
the expert i I don't see we don't see

948
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,280
any problem with that

949
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:24,860
I don't don't think the ice G would

950
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,540
either so yeah I mean it's definitely

951
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,580
something to think about when creating

952
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:32,779
new registries and what registration

953
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:34,580
procedures to use that's really of

954
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,370
course up to you all and your working

955
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,660
groups of what you want to choose

956
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:42,870
unfortunately with the requests that

957
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,940
you've experienced we we've

958
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,830
the issue with getting fast response

959
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,940
rates and we're continuing to work

960
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:52,890
through it and we've had actually some

961
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,510
additional meetings to try to see if we

962
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,730
can improve the template to ask the

963
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:00,540
right questions so we're constantly

964
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:03,420
trying to think about how we can make

965
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,730
things easier better improve the doc

966
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,500
that improve the information when we

967
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,450
originally get it so there's less

968
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,790
back-and-forth with experts it's it's

969
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:14,879
something we constantly want to know

970
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,830
what we can do to make it better and in

971
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,330
time because we have a couple more

972
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:23,700
things there any feedback you guys have

973
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:26,910
you can send it directly to me you can

974
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,560
send it to our Jana at Ayana org or on

975
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,259
the working group chairs list if you

976
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,770
want to start a discussion on anything

977
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:37,320
come visit us at the table we love to

978
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,960
get feedback we're trying to find some

979
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,170
common themes from the working group

980
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,470
chairs to I mean help your lives pretty

981
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,290
much

982
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,700
which ultimately will help us thank you

983
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,840
for the feedback we really do appreciate

984
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:54,350
it thanks Michele all right meeting

985
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,350
minute tools

986
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:14,950
so I'd really had just one question

987
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:17,170
which I'll ask at the end but I wanted

988
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:20,910
to see the question with some discussion

989
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:24,610
around meeting minutes and talk about

990
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:27,310
well maybe some of the reasons why we

991
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:30,430
have meeting minutes and after I'd put

992
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:33,220
imagine some but I'm sure there are more

993
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:38,710
that you can think of as to why we do

994
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:41,560
take meeting minutes the the how is this

995
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,690
a little bit of a problematic part in

996
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,779
the sense that we have to find someone

997
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:48,340
willing to take those minutes I know we

998
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,560
have etherpad I mean we have the

999
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:54,280
convenience of people converging on a

1000
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:57,299
way to collect minutes but our

1001
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,730
experience has generally shown that it's

1002
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,740
at the best at best those minutes come

1003
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,510
out a little scrappy they're good

1004
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,509
they're good enough for maybe the

1005
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,850
immediate purpose but really if I want

1006
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,630
to querent ly understand what actually

1007
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:18,279
happened I might have to actually go to

1008
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:20,880
some tools and the tools are what idea

1009
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,890
provides the audio stream the media Co

1010
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,900
recordings and he there was even a

1011
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,810
suggestion of some apps that have been

1012
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:33,400
developed for meeting minutes so maybe

1013
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:37,900
we should be using those so by virtue of

1014
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:41,470
the fact that oh so some BC peas and

1015
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:45,330
this is just a view of me and my

1016
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:47,560
co-chair that we tend to land up usually

1017
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:49,720
using the minutes that were taken in the

1018
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,210
minutes as so-called temporary minutes

1019
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,790
you need to have something in place so

1020
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:59,050
we take whatever we gather in the

1021
00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:00,610
meeting and we have had at least one

1022
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:03,010
occasion where the audio stream went

1023
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:05,230
down and we actually didn't have a part

1024
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,990
of the recording so it was good to have

1025
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:11,080
some minutes but really at the end of

1026
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:14,290
the effort what happens is we go back

1027
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:17,440
into and listen to the stream and use

1028
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,970
some transcribing to to get the output

1029
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,940
of the

1030
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:26,879
and then edit it and make it generally

1031
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:28,960
available as the meeting minutes so

1032
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,300
what's your the fact that I get to ask

1033
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,340
the question I is I don't have to get

1034
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,890
give you any answers for the question

1035
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,540
really is it can be replaced

1036
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,089
taking meeting minutes with the tools

1037
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,890
that we already have in place and maybe

1038
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:46,110
use some of the transcribing and editing

1039
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,109
capability that might have to be added

1040
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,070
[Laughter]

1041
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:04,630
Perkins I know I I had a little

1042
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:07,150
concerning that people often just try

1043
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:09,250
and transcribe or what people say in the

1044
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,400
minutes that the minutes should be

1045
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,900
recording the decisions rather than just

1046
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,630
summarizing what everyone says not

1047
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,630
trying to record what was said

1048
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,009
or just a data point for the for the

1049
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:31,140
plenary we tried to do an automatic

1050
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:34,170
transcript a couple of meetings ago we

1051
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:36,690
had the the Secretariat generated and

1052
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:40,369
take a look at it and their conclusion

1053
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:42,660
was that the amount of time it took to

1054
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:44,609
correct that automatically generated

1055
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,140
transcript and turn it into language

1056
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:47,848
that could be understood by somebody who

1057
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,940
hadn't attended the plenary or watch the

1058
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:52,289
video was essentially equivalent to the

1059
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,569
amount of time it took for them to just

1060
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:58,380
take the notes from watching the video

1061
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:59,579
so we decided not to do that I think I

1062
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,839
think there's some special challenges

1063
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:06,299
also because we have you know people

1064
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:07,470
like we like sometimes to have no

1065
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:09,660
people's names as you're taking the

1066
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,430
minutes attribution we use a lot of

1067
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,339
acronyms people with very different

1068
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:16,049
accents from all around the world and I

1069
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:18,450
think some of the tools as good as

1070
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:20,788
they've gotten still struggle with with

1071
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:23,250
those aspects so we found that it was

1072
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:29,309
easier to just have somebody take the

1073
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:31,710
minutes so for me I actually find it

1074
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:34,380
useful to have it the very least a

1075
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:37,140
sequence of who spoke and in what order

1076
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,180
so then when I bring up the video stream

1077
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,368
I can kind of find that place in the

1078
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,230
video stream by comparing it against the

1079
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,970
minutes and then I can listen to you

1080
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,710
exactly what they said but you know if

1081
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:49,019
there's a brief summary of kind of the

1082
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:52,410
topic of what they're saying that's just

1083
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:53,788
really helpful to me in finding the

1084
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,649
place so that I can really hear the

1085
00:51:53,789 --> 00:51:58,710
discussion which is why I do more than

1086
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:00,690
just summarize I mean like at the high

1087
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,140
level summarize but actually at the

1088
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,880
person-to-person summarize um yeah I

1089
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:09,480
have found in watching some of these

1090
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:15,660
ought Auto things that it is really

1091
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:17,880
hilarious on what they do and the other

1092
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,519
thing I wanted to mention is you know

1093
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,309
we've had some times where Power has

1094
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:28,109
gone out and things like that and there

1095
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:29,940
has been no recording what happened and

1096
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:32,830
it's really useful to have the minute

1097
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:36,630
taker in place before that happens

1098
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,630
[Laughter]

1099
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:47,489
yet to follow up that response tech : I

1100
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:49,619
I tend to when I take minutes note the

1101
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:52,579
point that was being made by the person

1102
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:55,829
at the mic as best as I can compress it

1103
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:58,259
but I think it's worth it for folks who

1104
00:52:55,829 --> 00:53:00,960
are not in the meeting room to read

1105
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:03,059
those minutes and see those points just

1106
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,579
to make sure that things that they

1107
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:11,160
wanted to be covered were or not covered

1108
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:12,960
and can reply to the list I it would be

1109
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,879
lovely if we could pull this off but I

1110
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:20,640
don't think we can and end up with

1111
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:23,309
something useful in the end decision is

1112
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:28,529
nearly worthless if you don't know the

1113
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:31,769
reasons for it and retaking so we have

1114
00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:35,640
to have that information I originally

1115
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:37,950
came up here to express my unhappiness

1116
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:42,210
that either paired crashed four times

1117
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:46,319
during our morning meeting but really

1118
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:48,719
the one thing that may be useful to you

1119
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:52,319
if you look at the YouTube recordings

1120
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:55,950
there is a well hidden button get

1121
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:59,749
transcript so if you have to enjoy the

1122
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,749
deliriousness you know where to get it

1123
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,200
you almost took all the wind out of my

1124
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:06,719
sails I'll give you an example suppose

1125
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,819
all you record is the decisions made and

1126
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,079
the only decision is made is we made no

1127
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,880
decision let's take this back to the

1128
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,989
list if you don't have all those points

1129
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,369
record somewhere you're just gonna

1130
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:17,009
repeat the discussion on the list so

1131
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:18,479
okay it's really important to have at

1132
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:20,940
least the summaries Pia was talking

1133
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:25,259
about all right so we have four minutes

1134
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,489
so let's talk fast hi Jim Fenton I think

1135
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:28,489
one of the things this is pointing out

1136
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:31,259
is there's a lot of uncertainty

1137
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:33,299
particularly by the minute takers about

1138
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:35,969
the level of granularity that they

1139
00:54:33,299 --> 00:54:37,440
should include and we need to have some

1140
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:38,930
guidelines somewhere and we need to have

1141
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,730
them somewhere that

1142
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,848
or maybe I just haven't found him yet

1143
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:46,490
but somewhere that when we ask for

1144
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:49,730
volunteer at a meeting they know what

1145
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:52,368
level of stuff to write in in the notes

1146
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,869
because we're often asking on the fly

1147
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:56,089
for a note-taker and somebody says well

1148
00:54:53,869 --> 00:55:02,599
I'll help but we don't tell them what to

1149
00:54:56,089 --> 00:55:04,009
do and then also if nobody volunteers we

1150
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:14,390
say all you have to do is record the

1151
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:16,819
actions to lessen the job so we can

1152
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:18,828
maybe identify some what we consider a

1153
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:22,150
good couple of good sets of minutes and

1154
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:24,619
points of these as examples that's true

1155
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,960
de volta my thought that just came to me

1156
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,220
was if there's a very short set of

1157
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,289
things that we could recommend to the

1158
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:33,109
note takers they might be able to post

1159
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:34,819
them in the boilerplate that that comes

1160
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:44,869
with either pad when you first load it

1161
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:46,549
up okay okay so the last thing besides

1162
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:49,099
open mic which we are not going to get

1163
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:51,619
to today is next steps for edgy

1164
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:53,420
activities we're going to spend a little

1165
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,710
bit of time talking about what a Jew

1166
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,119
activities currently are and what we

1167
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:58,940
might do with them I think the really

1168
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:00,980
short thing that I want to get to all of

1169
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:05,809
you on is we're still working on getting

1170
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:07,700
it fixed on the slides but on the data

1171
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:09,589
tracker but edgy team is now an open

1172
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,000
mailing list and anybody that wants to

1173
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:13,549
join the edgy team is welcome to do so

1174
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,760
and over the course of the next three or

1175
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:19,549
four months we'll be we're basically

1176
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,319
going to keep what we're doing for the

1177
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:23,029
next three to four months and then in

1178
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:25,279
that timeframe we're gonna think about

1179
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:26,930
what do we really need from an edgy team

1180
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:29,420
and how we really want to construct it

1181
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:31,009
and I'd really encourage you all a lot

1182
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,020
of the things we talked about today it

1183
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:35,539
would be great if we had a little bit

1184
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,970
better materials for the working group

1185
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:39,140
chairs and you know there might be an

1186
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,669
opportunity to have some professional

1187
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,859
and developed resources what would those

1188
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:45,400
resources need to be so I think there's

1189
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:48,440
a lot of work that needs to be done and

1190
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,420
I would strongly encourage people that

1191
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,770
are interested in this space to join the

1192
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:55,650
edgy team and

1193
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:59,100
not as you discuss as you team and we'll

1194
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:03,180
get all that fixed eventually so with

1195
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:04,980
that it's 11 it's 114 so I think we're

1196
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,589
going to skip the open mic and take all

1197
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,910
of that to the mailing list thank you

1198
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:13,000
all

1199
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:13,000
[Applause]
