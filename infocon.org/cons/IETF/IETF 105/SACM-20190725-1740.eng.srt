00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,549

45
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,169
calls for the first order of business is

46
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:58,500
to discuss each of those documents and

47
00:03:52,169 --> 00:04:01,439
the okay discuss chase through those and

48
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,479
see what the status of it is and I have

49
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,918
been instructed to start with EP CP

50
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:14,729
which I'm still struggling because I

51
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:17,159
finally learned we got several very good

52
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,500
reviews we will absolutely get right on

53
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:20,789
top of incorporating the comments with

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,870
those views in the document and I'll try

55
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,810
to

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,740
would it be too late to say September

57
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,740
butts next one that's awful

58
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:40,590
babies presents yeah it must be okay so

59
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,820
so out of so did you see any showstopper

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,650
issues do you think there's any

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,690
showstopper issues in there no just

62
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,280
tanked might not live past my having to

63
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,640
deal with this 97 comments but other

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:08,140
than that it's fine I'll let you know

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:12,039
where the body is we told them that you

66
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,539
wanted to say something all right so you

67
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,160
say no showstopper issues you plan for

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,020
an update in September and then we will

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,060
address getting it out of working your

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,060
blog call at that point yep fabulous

71
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:37,870
we'll put you after the after we go over

72
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:49,150
the working class called dots okay

73
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:50,560
Steven Rowley so I have a very small

74
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:55,510
number of slides hopefully this will be

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,480
super fast so I have done some updates

76
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,900
on the software descriptor extension to

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,310
Rowley

78
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,669
in accordance with the review that I

79
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,200
received the first round of reviews that

80
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,790
I got when the working group last call

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,490
first started we're all integrated into

82
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,470
version 7 and then we had the extended

83
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,410
working group last call and I got an

84
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,600
additional several reviews that's all

85
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,750
been integrated into version 8 which I

86
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,250
have posted it was like at the start of

87
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,440
this week like Sunday or something like

88
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,820
that so the most recent version reflects

89
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,410
all of the review that I've gotten

90
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,690
during working group last call I had a

91
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,070
great lot of really great comments and a

92
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,380
lot of really great fixes and little

93
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,380
things like that next slide please

94
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,180
the only thing that I would consider a

95
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,699
major change and it's not even really

96
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,990
that is actually a typo fix in a

97
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:51,009
normative requirement the required

98
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,469
application media-type for the coast wit

99
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,419
was originally Co Swift plus c4 which

100
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:59,830
was a mistake and that should have been

101
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,719
application Swit plus c bore it's taken

102
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,699
right out of the coast would draft so

103
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:05,439
that typo was fixed that mistake is

104
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,029
fixed and now we're in alignment with

105
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,580
the coast would draft and everything is

106
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,009
good to go and was always meant to

107
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,198
reference that in the first place and

108
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,750
then just a lot of minor fixes some

109
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,400
language changes you know the kind of

110
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,110
stuff you'd expect to see at the end of

111
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,989
a working group last call so I think the

112
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,520
documents in really good shape at the

113
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,300
end of its working group last call and

114
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,310
next slide please

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,520
so this giraffe does have a normative

116
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,469
reference to coast wood but but not the

117
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,090
other way around so I think that timing

118
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,979
is good to kind of move them both along

119
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,638
at the same time here up so that we can

120
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:44,229
get that reference resolved so I think

121
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,500
the documents ready to move on to the

122
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:54,849
next step and leave leave up to the

123
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:56,229
chairs what they think okay I mean based

124
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,378
on the mailing list traffic I didn't see

125
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:01,060
any opposition to the dress I don't does

126
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,930
anybody here have any further comments I

127
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:10,949
based on the working group last call

128
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:13,060
nope okay I guess then with that we will

129
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,629
exit let working group last call and

130
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,669
progress it onward and upward excellent

131
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,650
okay thank you everyone for your review

132
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:28,830
and and all the help in getting the

133
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:28,830
draft good thanks and coast wit

134
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,319
Soko swig

135
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,120
so this draft is intended to provide a

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,990
concise format that helps to identify

137
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,190
and describe software components patches

138
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,410
and installation bundles that either may

139
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,610
be installed a device or may be found on

140
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,850
that device it uses the concise binary

141
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,300
object representation to express this

142
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,490
information the Coase would draft is

143
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,949
based on similar constructs that exist

144
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:18,650
in iso/iec 1 9 7 7 0-2 which is called a

145
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,450
software identification tag so one way

146
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:25,689
of thinking about Coast wave is it's the

147
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,690
maybe younger brother of house with tags

148
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,699
so we've been working on the draft for a

149
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,490
while it's been in working group last

150
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,790
call we received quite a few comments

151
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,650
during the working group last call so

152
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,270
really grateful to all of the reviewers

153
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:46,189
they think we had something like nine

154
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:49,520
nine reviews this point we've addressed

155
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,700
the comments that were provided by the

156
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:58,280
reviewers three three reviewers provide

157
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:00,830
us with with detailed comments those

158
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,510
adjustments are published in the -

159
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,080
twelve revision which is now out there

160
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:10,430
on the other data tracker that was this

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,410
morning the one exception was I think

162
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,800
Alex pointed out one additional typo

163
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:19,520
that isn't in that version so I figured

164
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,349
I'm you know wait until we see if

165
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,959
there's any more comments and then I'll

166
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:30,080
just submit a quick update before it

167
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:32,270
goes through - to the is G so there were

168
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,350
a bunch of changes as a result of the

169
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,339
working group last call none that were

170
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,030
significant from a normative perspective

171
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:43,070
but a lot of clarification so fixed a

172
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,560
bunch of you know minor editorial issue

173
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,520
use a lot of typos here and there a lot

174
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,829
of little grammar fixes we had a text

175
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,380
about the use of utf-8 and Coast wit

176
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,600
which was already implied because when

177
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,490
you see Lauren see board uses the utf-8

178
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,910
but we're explaining that more

179
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:05,390
explicitly now the one normative change

180
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:08,270
I believe that we made as far as the

181
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,840
model was adjusted the tag ID to allow

182
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:16,610
for a you you ID to provide it as a 16

183
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:18,940
that should be a 16 byte B string and

184
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,960
that was based on Karstens feedback I

185
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,230
did a lot of work to clean up

186
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,540
descriptions about index ranges removed

187
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,190
a lot of the discussion about the the

188
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:36,079
size of various fields but instead

189
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,910
talked about the ranges I just said the

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,680
discussion about private use ranges

191
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:44,990
within the draft and make it more clear

192
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,239
I did I did move the private use to

193
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,950
negative integer values which is more

194
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,490
consistent with some other see board

195
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:59,120
based drafts which also then makes the

196
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,250
the standards track and specification

197
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,130
required range is slightly larger which

198
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,590
I think is also a benefit that didn't

199
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,770
actually change any of the initial

200
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:14,570
registrations so it's really not a big

201
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:16,430
normative change I had some discussion

202
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,400
around resolving overlapping value

203
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,620
spaces for version schemes because I

204
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,680
also added some expert review guidelines

205
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,710
that require that version schemes don't

206
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,349
have overlapping namespaces and some of

207
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,010
the initial ones do but we're stuck with

208
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,990
those because we're using the initial

209
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,760
values that come from sweet sweet tags

210
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,370
does they in sync with with that

211
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,340
specification so there's some discussion

212
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,770
around which version scheme you should

213
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,400
use if it overlaps with the value space

214
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,290
of other of other version schemes and

215
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,110
then the expert review guidelines I

216
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,520
think will give us will give expert

217
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,740
reviewers a much better basis

218
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,340
which to review all of the new IANA

219
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,150
registries by it says things like you

220
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,810
know avoiding vanity names and you know

221
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:12,060
to provide some guidance around

222
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:16,280
providing clear semantic definitions of

223
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:21,390
what each of the valid values represent

224
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:23,189
how it see and and then based on some of

225
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,590
the other comments that we have gotten

226
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,290
through working group last call I added

227
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,150
I Anna registrations there's three new

228
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,550
ones that have been added

229
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,380
these are registrations for the sweet

230
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,319
and sweet path your eye schemes which

231
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:42,330
were used in both sweet tags and Coast

232
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:45,720
whit tags and a registration for using

233
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:49,770
coast wid with Schwimmer which Charles

234
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,010
had had asked for a long time ago but I

235
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:58,470
neglected to go back and look at those

236
00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:02,520
archives so that's all of the changes in

237
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,890
the dash 12 for vision so at this point

238
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,900
all open issues on the draft have been

239
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,580
addressed we've yeah we've completed all

240
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,720
changes needed based on the provided

241
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:26,580
comments so looking to the chairs for

242
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:39,180
advice on how to move forward yes is

243
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:42,540
there something in I remain on hold on

244
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,640
jabber Dave you add in RFC five one nine

245
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,920
eight but Carsten is writing the

246
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,199
successor and didn't like the five one

247
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,770
nine eight reference yeah so I looked at

248
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,350
that and and the real difference between

249
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:57,600
five one nine eight and and and its

250
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,520
success and its potential successor

251
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,940
because it's still a personal draft is

252
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,770
I'm dealing with line feeds because five

253
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,500
one nine eight basically requires that

254
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,870
you use carriage returns and line sheets

255
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,850
as a as a line ending character

256
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,600
and if you want just line feeds alone

257
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:19,110
you can't get that based on the current

258
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,639
definition but that didn't seem like

259
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,190
something that was worth actually

260
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,769
holding up the publication of coastward

261
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,959
around because you know the the line

262
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:32,459
endings that are defined in the current

263
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,018
RFC seem to be you know enough for for

264
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,050
the kinds of use cases that we're trying

265
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:40,800
to support this is think this is more

266
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:47,339
common it's just Begich from 10 net okay

267
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:50,609
yeah Carson would take care of that that

268
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,850
we cannot put it in first person attract

269
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,459
signal or you don't know how this

270
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,380
evolves reference and it's not a real

271
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,800
cough follow-up work you could make an

272
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,250
errata

273
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,500
later and say we can make it better with

274
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,600
this unique version but I think this is

275
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,130
not yeah I think you have to be from

276
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,380
sort of all right now yeah and I would

277
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,910
be happy to write and updated a draft

278
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,100
that would update curse word at some

279
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,870
point in the future if this becomes a an

280
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,360
issue this is again I agree with keeping

281
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,980
the five one nine eight records thanks

282
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:31,440
Sarah okay are there any other comments

283
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:33,980
on this draft okay just one second so

284
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,209
mm-hmm so I do have to submit one more

285
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:41,790
revision because there's one more small

286
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:45,300
typo so if you could oh yeah but you are

287
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:47,130
out of cycle actually what we had just

288
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,779
discussed was because the the draft

289
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,139
despite it didn't despite the fact that

290
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,490
it did not have a lot of a lot of

291
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,260
substantive changes we thought we would

292
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,240
give like a two-week period for Pete for

293
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,040
people to have a chance to review the

294
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,660
final draft before we forward it as far

295
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,829
as we're concerned we have consensus of

296
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,379
the working group to forward it and

297
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,809
people have one last chance to get all

298
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,240
of the last typos fixed set work for

299
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,490
everybody I think we've got we've had

300
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,679
good review on this so I guess our

301
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,140
browbeating I would say we were beyond

302
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,140
good read to you at this point it's a

303
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,600
lot of revisions oh it's a good working

304
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:28,730
your class collar yeah that's so

305
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:31,158
send them in so so we'll do a two-week

306
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,049
double check of the updated draft and so

307
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,009
if I were you I would hold that one typo

308
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,070
yeah

309
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:41,769
for the next okay any other comments or

310
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,769
questions on this draft okay

311
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,689
we haven't determined a shepherd yet do

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:18:22,908
we need to do that now no okay good all

313
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:27,220
right thank you so Kathleen I think so

314
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:29,299
more than one Leslie ten oh great

315
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,809
Roman did I was asking her we add up

316
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:35,059
administrative items I'm just going

317
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,200
through well we were going through

318
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,450
working your class called were there

319
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,159
other administrative - I was going to

320
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:45,320
ask the milestone deep updates for the

321
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,039
documents that are not important group

322
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,549
last call yeah the census we'll talk

323
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,749
about it later

324
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,749
oh we can talk about later

325
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:17,779
just do a search for IOF and you'll find

326
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:20,029
that in that page I know yeah I should I

327
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:24,440
don't have to be a doctor for mine okay

328
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:27,200
so at I know I think a few of you it may

329
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,070
be not I think was it just Chris and I

330
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,580
at the Charis workshop so we went

331
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,750
through some brainstorming exercises and

332
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:43,639
for one section we talked about adoption

333
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:48,039
and lack of adoption on protocols just

334
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:51,200
to kind of get a feel of what helps and

335
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:54,669
in thinking about this work I really

336
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,169
want to see it get adopted right and so

337
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:01,929
one of the I guess one of the core

338
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:04,370
findings was for the protocols that or

339
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:09,850
structured formats that haven't taken

340
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:15,739
off wildly the work done didn't match

341
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:17,510
what people wanted right and so I want

342
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,760
to make sure and I know it's kind of

343
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,549
late to do that that we kind of reassess

344
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,090
and this is after I took a look at a few

345
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:27,620
documents recently and also you know

346
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,389
seeing that we might be splitting off

347
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:34,928
separately from what s cap is doing is

348
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:40,010
that the right decision you know who's

349
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:42,760
who's listening to the users most so

350
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,919
with sticks

351
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,600
people aren't as interested is the

352
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
discussion from Kara so maybe it's

353
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,158
different from reality for other people

354
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,330
they're more interested in using it as a

355
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:59,980
format to manage their content than they

356
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,149
are for exchanges and IO def it

357
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,330
described more than what people wanted

358
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:07,668
to exchange so that might have been one

359
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,250
of the hindrances to adoption so in

360
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:12,080
thinking about this I mean I think it's

361
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,659
pretty clear people want to a

362
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,449
their system integrity they want to get

363
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:21,789
the data in on their systems be able to

364
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:28,909
map map it back to expected policies and

365
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:30,740
have secure systems so and then we have

366
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,840
different methods of exchange that we've

367
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,260
discussed we've discussed XMPP grid

368
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,189
we've discussed Rolly

369
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,049
I personally can see the case for

370
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,510
exchange within an enterprise I could

371
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:49,279
see you know out to a managed service

372
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:51,500
that's doing assessments and you may

373
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:55,970
have different exposures than I do and

374
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,360
so I kind of wanted to just take that

375
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,419
step back for a minute and see you know

376
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,879
maybe it's customer driven what are the

377
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:07,039
cases where you're gonna see this used

378
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,830
if it's your products you're hearing

379
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:17,570
from customers where the exchange or the

380
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:19,668
format's are needed anyone anyone yeah I

381
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,529
and and then I'm even wondering like

382
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:23,779
there's some brainstorming exercises we

383
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,039
did a Karis it might be worth doing some

384
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,870
of those I might do have tools that we

385
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,490
could do it online where we could

386
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,549
collaborate and just kind of reassess

387
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:34,130
just to see if we could maybe we're on

388
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,750
the right track for adoption maybe we

389
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,429
need to reassess and make sure we're

390
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,429
doing the right thing towards adoption

391
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:48,679
so from CIS experiences he is right yeah

392
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,789
we develop best practices controls and

393
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,740
then we have all the benchmarks and

394
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,629
everything they offered a variety

395
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,130
different tools software right that

396
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,799
helped people actually implement that

397
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,490
stuff a lot of the feedback we get or

398
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:04,970
questions I should say that we get from

399
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:07,429
users of the CIS controls is wow that's

400
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:13,070
a lot of tools to use how do I get them

401
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:15,289
to work together okay quickly right

402
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,970
right what they want is their

403
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,129
interoperability out of the box says

404
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,760
that's are expensive so and and what

405
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,430
comes to mind is a blog post from where

406
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,460
the product managers at tripwire

407
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,760
okay he recently posted I think it was

408
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,800
just earlier this month house they have

409
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,750
this idea where they actually want to

410
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,000
create a community of open-source tools

411
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,040
that just work together and to me it's

412
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,300
kind of like okay yes let's do that but

413
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,820
let's let them work on a common

414
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,889
infrastructure based on standards

415
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,649
correct right which is kind of where I

416
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,360
see this work being like this working

417
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,130
group writing can we establish what that

418
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,770
comment is infrastructure needs to look

419
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,210
like so that the different components in

420
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,760
the various different workflows that

421
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,550
need to happen just talk to each other

422
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,160
okay and so are the most common

423
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:09,530
components within a network exchanges

424
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:12,680
between networks okay do we need to

425
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:17,510
divide it out in terms of how we get you

426
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:20,420
know staged adoption don't let me run

427
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,280
too long like I I could develop a whole

428
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,690
little session like I I mean Chris was

429
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,730
eric harris i could develop a little

430
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,520
session for an interim where we could

431
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,740
really brainstorm this and I can make

432
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,200
you guys use posties and like really fun

433
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:40,250
things for online collaboration sounds a

434
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,560
threat that sounds like a threat i I

435
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,750
want to see this I want to see I want to

436
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,929
see Adams goals met right like he said I

437
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:50,090
want to see that happen and I want all

438
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,790
the hard work happening from you guys to

439
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:56,379
go forward and make an impact because

440
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:59,810
the endpoints have problems don't they

441
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:04,100
so so let's hear what every bit the rest

442
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:07,700
of the Q has to say only quiet so I will

443
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,530
stand with my vendor hat on mm-hmm so I

444
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:15,910
do have experience in some of these

445
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:19,129
pieces the more complex a standard is

446
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,740
the less likely we as vendors are going

447
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,980
to implement unless we have extreme

448
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:29,210
compelling reasons from customer demand

449
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:32,030
so it's usually easier when they're

450
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,940
simple and easy and they're iterative

451
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,950
and we add to them and we can

452
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,980
punctuality and feature but if I give

453
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,990
this to product management and then to

454
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,629
architects to look at and they come back

455
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,850
and tell me oh that's 9 months or 12

456
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:49,149
months before we can implement it's not

457
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,039
gonna happen just let me finish okay and

458
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:52,840
if things come back and they say oh yeah

459
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,789
I can do some of this over the weekend

460
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,178
you know it may not take over the

461
00:25:54,789 --> 00:26:00,070
weekend but it does get done so I've

462
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:02,740
ranted about this before in standards

463
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,269
not just here but in lots of other

464
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,299
places that there's a PR marketing

465
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:09,490
problem that we all suffer from and it

466
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,789
really takes a lot of work to get the

467
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,830
market to understand it to get you know

468
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:16,750
the various communities to know what it

469
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,779
is how it works why they should be

470
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,850
asking their vendors for it and boiling

471
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:24,429
it down into bite-sized chunks that

472
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:27,039
people can grok and so I was joking

473
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:29,289
earlier like who's going to start

474
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,000
writing like that to get started guide

475
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,039
for some of these things like they help

476
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,870
people and I know we've done some of it

477
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,090
you've done a lot of excellent work with

478
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:47,699
this but a Stanford you know design

479
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:53,019
school exercise with post-it notes my so

480
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:54,820
again as a vendor then right so respect

481
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:57,309
if I have I think is that none of this

482
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,689
work here the code components that that

483
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:01,960
you would implement as a vendor right

484
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,820
would be considered your secret sauce

485
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,620
your core stuff that you need to get

486
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,809
done right I think that would be true

487
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,850
for any better so the question I have is

488
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:12,039
if there were collaborative leak about

489
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,230
open software that you could integrate

490
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,389
with your tools so that you didn't have

491
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:25,360
to bear all the cost of developing this

492
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:27,820
with that help it can help but it also

493
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,879
depends on the complexity of the code

494
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,809
that we are consuming and the liability

495
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:35,830
of the maintenance of that code there

496
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,928
interoperability is critical

497
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,699
interoperability documents and plugfest

498
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,470
where we actually get vendors together

499
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,389
and we actually start working on things

500
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,280
and you know kind of like the hackathon

501
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:51,689
that at a different level are critical

502
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,060
I won't speak on sticks but just purely

503
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,650
as the vendor side of it it there's

504
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:59,370
things like this that can help it you

505
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,340
also have to distill these hundreds of

506
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,659
pages of documents into things that

507
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,100
product management and architects can

508
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,680
understand because quite house is there

509
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,290
nothing so we have to delete it once

510
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,920
there's a commitment by the business

511
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,659
unit to implement and so I like along

512
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,340
these technologies that's why I come

513
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,730
that's why I try to support them I try

514
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,439
to meet as much of it as I can and

515
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,750
question Dave's severely may actually

516
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,320
have comments on his document but I

517
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,510
think that it there's a PR marketing

518
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,639
problem that I think we could work on

519
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:37,770
and help and so some of this so I think

520
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,720
the step back to see what what the core

521
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,230
pieces are that build might be might be

522
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,810
quite useful

523
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,850
this is hang and talking about this

524
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,889
never-ending cycle of what are we

525
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,469
actually going to do that customer need

526
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,910
this and is it opera might be very happy

527
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,970
about the results that we presented

528
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:59,010
build from the hectare from kasnia

529
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,290
actually were sick and tired of talking

530
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,150
about stuff we started implementing for

531
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,540
three hectic plans now and we know

532
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,650
tangible really good things to show that

533
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,350
amazingly there's light at the end of

534
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,780
the Sun oh I think this might push some

535
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:18,360
things that you would actually wanted

536
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:21,000
okay Dave altameyer so I think we're

537
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,740
probably yeah what we need I cut so we

538
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,130
started this process what seven years

539
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,740
ago and and when we originally were

540
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:31,440
chartering you know I showed up as long

541
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,390
as condition to a bunch of other books

542
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,270
from the SKF community because we wanted

543
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,610
to work on sort of the next versions of

544
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:42,120
some of the core s kept specifications

545
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:45,540
things like X CCDF and opal and and

546
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,610
those kinds of things then we we ran

547
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,770
into some problems organizing that work

548
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,719
we ran into problems with getting IPR

549
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,190
release and on some of that work and it

550
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,580
ended up dragging out for like two or

551
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,100
three years and then

552
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm praying yes kept community more or

553
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,459
less left and didn't come back and you

554
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,159
know so we're here now much of that

555
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,240
community in this room a little bit but

556
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,640
but not much

557
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,320
and recently Jess and I have been

558
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,059
working to try to rebuild that community

559
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,189
because when we started working on sac

560
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:16,840
them we basically said we're not going

561
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,700
to meet as a community anymore we're

562
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,610
gonna start meeting inside the ietf to

563
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,000
actually do this work and we basically

564
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,500
stopped meeting as a community and now

565
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,450
and and so as a result folks actually

566
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,740
said all is just kept dead you know or

567
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,169
you know what we're working on that

568
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,649
because really for the last seven or so

569
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:37,029
years there hasn't been much work on

570
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:39,549
we're starting to rebuild that community

571
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,169
by meeting outside of the IETF and we're

572
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:45,210
starting to get some interest on doing

573
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:49,120
some the authoring formats things like

574
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,679
I'm really reluctant to suggest to those

575
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,469
people that we should go back and try

576
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:56,980
the IETF again because it just didn't

577
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,389
work the first time and okay so that's

578
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,149
one thing I want to figure out what

579
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:03,219
we're doing here but we can do this I

580
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:07,018
think in an interim that we're doing

581
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,850
something you know not just for the u.s.

582
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,649
the broader community that makes sense

583
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,090
that's digestible that will get

584
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:16,959
implemented that will actually solve

585
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:19,840
these problems okay and and Jess I'm

586
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:30,250
sorry but I wouldn't let I cut the mic

587
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:35,220
and then wouldn't let him talk okay so

588
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:41,529
thank you for that time right so do you

589
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:44,620
do the question of having you giving you

590
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:47,309
some interim time was that does that

591
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:54,699
make sense with people like that just

592
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:57,428
yeah okay okay let's do the official

593
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,230
IETF way everybody hum that would like

594
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:01,230
to see some interim time devoted to this

595
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:15,869
hum if you would rather not yeah

596
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:15,869
look at that you're welcome

597
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,309
[Music]

598
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,940
there we go right this time all right

599
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:47,949
okay so the hackathon so Hank approves

600
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:53,049
of the hackathon which is good everybody

601
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:55,479
wants that again I'll mention karl-heinz

602
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:57,989
a couple times on here but he joined the

603
00:32:55,479 --> 00:33:00,309
hackathon remotely from Germany and

604
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:06,029
throughout the weekend and provided a

605
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:09,879
lot of help so so we we had a number of

606
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:11,649
objectives going in kind of wanted to

607
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:13,899
start talking a little bit about how to

608
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:16,988
represent what's information to collect

609
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:22,619
from an import and from an endpoint how

610
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:24,849
to represent what was collected kind of

611
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:28,209
dovetailing a little bit on some of the

612
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:30,460
s cap stuff I'll probably talk a little

613
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:34,029
bit about that on other slides but I

614
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:36,970
used some adaptations of some s cap

615
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:39,249
content in there we wanted to implement

616
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,869
a simple collector actually to interpret

617
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:43,649
that that what to collect information

618
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:46,809
and actually get it from that endpoint

619
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:51,908
thankfully I work on a tool that does

620
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:56,668
stuff like that so we wanted to do some

621
00:33:51,909 --> 00:34:02,169
cool things with XMPP as transport we

622
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:04,869
wanted to I tried to get the ability to

623
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:07,389
use a number of different XMPP features

624
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:11,020
to actually shuttle the data around and

625
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:13,509
cause good things to happen so that i

626
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,509
q-- stanzas the information query allows

627
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:20,139
a request and response sort of model to

628
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,820
tell and then a collector to actually

629
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,090
grab in

630
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:27,240
from from the endpoint and send it back

631
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,180
to the entity that requested it there's

632
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,979
some other entities other stanzas out

633
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,469
there and other functionality we use

634
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,969
publish/subscribe capabilities of XMPP

635
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,639
to do that as well to move that

636
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:40,469
information around and actually ended up

637
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,770
being able to shuttle it around using

638
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:46,439
just basic XMPP messages so just as I

639
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,570
would send a chat message to somebody I

640
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,880
can send the payload to to tell that

641
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,310
entity to collect and not really care if

642
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,820
they send me a response and just assume

643
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,650
that either they would send something

644
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,290
back if there was a if there was an

645
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,940
error processing it or just go off and

646
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:06,450
do its thing and send the data to to

647
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,100
where it's supposed to go on top of that

648
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,140
we wanted to do some cool things with

649
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,060
concise map we wanted to take the

650
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,100
collected information those system

651
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:18,690
characteristics that we collected from

652
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:22,410
that endpoint translate that into to the

653
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,960
the concise map seaboard format we we

654
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:28,680
modeled a little bit of that that

655
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,660
collected information into CD DL and

656
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,700
I'll get to that on a couple of slides

657
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,370
and then we wanted to kind of extract

658
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,490
that content back out from that map

659
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,080
representation and reconstruct it as XML

660
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:45,060
to make sure that it was still the same

661
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,319
which we did so talking a little bit

662
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,130
about the data models the what to

663
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,600
collect and what information is

664
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:59,190
collected currently the the current

665
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:01,319
ovale data models actually a tightly

666
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,430
coupled collection and evaluation into a

667
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,020
very large document centric kind of

668
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,549
format so you kind of have to send all

669
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,170
of the things that you want to test and

670
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,920
evaluate and collect and all that kind

671
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,840
of stuff in one big format I actually

672
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,330
extracted out all of the collection

673
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,890
piece to make it its own sort of

674
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:23,670
separate namespace so all you have to

675
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:27,560
actually pass as are the what-what ovale

676
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:30,690
calls objects which really allows you to

677
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,070
just indicate what to collect there's

678
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,819
some other things in there but we didn't

679
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,069
get into the more comp

680
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:39,130
educated things that you can do with

681
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:41,079
oval like sets and filters and variables

682
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,549
and things like that they're they're

683
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,940
modeled in there but we didn't test any

684
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:47,259
of them so again we redefined some of

685
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,599
the namespaces called the oval

686
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:51,670
collections and then all you need to do

687
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,380
is again send like I only want this

688
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:58,599
registry key or I only want this what

689
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,350
did we use environment variable for

690
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,549
example so there's a number of

691
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,690
[Applause]

692
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:06,788
platform-specific schemas that are out

693
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,749
there so I just migrated the core in the

694
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,420
platform-independent

695
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:11,859
that kind of gave me a list of ten ten

696
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,309
or twelve objects that I needed to

697
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:18,819
figure out how to collect there are some

698
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:21,279
cool XML that shows what that is there's

699
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,199
a family object which is pretty gives

700
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,430
the operating system family and we did

701
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,839
some environment variables those were

702
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,288
they those were basically the two

703
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,239
objects we tested with the system

704
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,369
characteristics that would come back if

705
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,109
anybody wants to know what my IP address

706
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:37,180
was okay that's not on there but the

707
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:40,029
computer name environment variable on my

708
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,469
machine is called Cisco to have it's

709
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:44,920
just in case anybody wants to know that

710
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:46,359
so this is an example of simple system

711
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,009
characteristics that come back once

712
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:53,469
you've collected that information from

713
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:56,049
the previously so again we were joined

714
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:57,549
by Carl Heine's he stayed up nicely till

715
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:01,329
to three o'clock in the morning on

716
00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:05,259
Saturday in in Germany two to keep

717
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:09,099
working on stuff he he is the expert on

718
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:11,499
the concise map stuff and a Java guy as

719
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:14,319
well so we had a good time

720
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:17,529
conversing through Hanks sort of video

721
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:19,479
chatting capabilities and were able to

722
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:21,989
if anybody saw me with headphones on the

723
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:26,558
entire time I was talking at Caroline's

724
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:27,910
so we created the XMPP extensions to

725
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,190
handle those collection requests

726
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,739
actually perform the collection generate

727
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:35,349
the system characteristics and actually

728
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:37,959
shuttled that data back via XMPP again

729
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:41,019
we did it through standard request

730
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:43,558
response capabilities in the XMPP iqs

731
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:45,399
stanzas we did it through

732
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,530
publish/subscribe we did it right

733
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,070
through direct XMP

734
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:53,530
feed messages as well on karl-heinz his

735
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,900
end he received the collected system

736
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,700
characteristics via an XMP an XMPP

737
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,100
adapter that he built so it basically

738
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,319
just listens for the messages and is

739
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,839
able to handle the payloads that we sent

740
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,340
back translated all that into the

741
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,980
Seaboard data published it to the map

742
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,840
was able to query that and then

743
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:17,890
translate that data back to the XML

744
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:19,990
format so we kind of had the previous

745
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,629
slide kind of showed how the the work

746
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,839
was divvied up I was kind of basically

747
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,850
responsible for the XMPP infrastructure

748
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:33,100
the Oval related stuff in the actual

749
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:34,960
collection which looks the pub/sub looks

750
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,450
like this so the orchestrator would

751
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,640
request the information to be collected

752
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,049
the collector would collect it and send

753
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,799
it back and then the orchestrator would

754
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:48,190
publish that to the to the pub subtopic

755
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,630
and then the the german side of the of

756
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,620
the equation was the XMPP adapter and

757
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:59,110
translating and saving all that stuff

758
00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:01,930
into that the map data the direct IQ

759
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:04,810
just basically replaces the the pub

760
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:07,390
subtopic with the XMPP adapter on the

761
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:11,830
German side I like this

762
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:16,420
German and American side status the

763
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:19,960
direct XMPP message again sort of does

764
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:22,540
not include the the response oh I didn't

765
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,920
update all of that slide so that that IQ

766
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,690
response containing ovale system

767
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,050
characteristics should just be that

768
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,760
should be deleted from that slide sorry

769
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,680
and it just has the the collector

770
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,510
sending sending the message stanza with

771
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,509
the with the system characteristics

772
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:43,470
karl-heinz did all the again the stuff

773
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,690
on the German side so he was able to

774
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:48,490
configure his XMPP adapter to subscribe

775
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,460
to that pub subtopic to receive that

776
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,200
that information he's also was able to

777
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,440
configure message listeners to be able

778
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,509
to retrieve again all of that data in

779
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,090
the in a standard message payload and a

780
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,809
standard IQ stanza to to then translate

781
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,589
that into

782
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:09,729
into sea bore and move that into the map

783
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:12,339
client and translate it back out this is

784
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:14,680
what the concise map model look like so

785
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:16,509
it's a series of identifiers and and

786
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,430
metadata that's sort of links those

787
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:23,819
identifiers so the I guess I can't

788
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,019
really walk over there but the system

789
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:28,900
identifier there is one of the

790
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:30,459
identifiers the the collection

791
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,609
identifier which is the one on the far

792
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:35,948
right hand corner identifies the actual

793
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,589
active collection the different

794
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:41,589
identifiers for the items that are right

795
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:43,479
next to the collection one identify the

796
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,920
basically the family item in the

797
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:48,698
environment variable that we collected

798
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,459
again this is all linkage together and

799
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:53,439
we could query both by system and by the

800
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:59,078
collection identifier to retrieve all of

801
00:41:53,439 --> 00:42:04,058
the associated data that we needed in

802
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:07,329
very light font and very small font with

803
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:11,019
some large arrows on it I just kind of

804
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:12,839
shows what's the the translated what

805
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:16,899
what the Seaboard looks like before it's

806
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:19,959
translated into into binary so we've got

807
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,390
the representation of what those

808
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:26,558
identifiers look like and what the all

809
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:31,359
the linkages between them so I'll try

810
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:36,670
not to make you eat that eye chart so we

811
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:40,058
we actually learned a ton in this we we

812
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:43,630
were able to again sort of use all of

813
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:45,369
XMP peas capabilities to both to

814
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,599
published subscribes and the request

815
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:50,349
response and send a direct message

816
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:53,939
stanza containing all that payload to

817
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:56,380
actually trigger the collection to

818
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:59,859
receive the system characteristics send

819
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:04,630
them over to the other side we were able

820
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:06,219
to again translate that map data or

821
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,459
translate the system characteristics

822
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:11,559
into the map data pull that extract that

823
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:12,999
information back out and reconstruct the

824
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,810
oval system characteristics from it

825
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:16,220
which can then help

826
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,549
eventually enables some downstream

827
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:24,140
downstream operations on that such as

828
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:26,960
evaluation reporting etc one thing we

829
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:29,779
did learn currently we that there's not

830
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,450
a really dynamic way to sort of

831
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,330
configure the map client it kind of has

832
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:38,149
to be pre-configured with the CDL to

833
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:41,299
kind of know exactly what's coming which

834
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,370
means the the CDL would need to

835
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,430
continuously evolve as the capability is

836
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:50,000
to collect and distribute that content

837
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:53,390
were to evolve as well so my collector

838
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,450
was actually able to you know it's kind

839
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,759
of it's fully sort of s cap compliance

840
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:02,450
so it can collect a number of different

841
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,250
platform specific items but the the

842
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:07,100
concise map implementation on the other

843
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,690
side could really only handle the family

844
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,790
and environment variable items that we

845
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,790
decided on before the hacks the one

846
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:23,270
things to keep going we were able to

847
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:25,220
really kind of help define some of the

848
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,009
operations that and interactions between

849
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,680
components so we want to start moving

850
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,260
them to get them included in as part of

851
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,310
the architecture a lot of the

852
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:41,300
information from the various data models

853
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:42,980
can be used and then hopefully to again

854
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,750
sort of start defining that core set of

855
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:50,570
operations that core set of interactions

856
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:52,070
between the different components so we

857
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,950
can continue to refine the oval

858
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,450
collection model so this is kind of

859
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,830
where I think it kind of connects a

860
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:03,350
little bit with some of the s kept work

861
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:08,450
that's going on I don't necessarily have

862
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:11,740
a favorite place where that that that

863
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:14,569
migration could take place I'm happy to

864
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,200
continue to flesh out the the oval

865
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:19,460
collection models and that decoupling of

866
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,700
collection and evaluation and take it to

867
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,830
the S cap 2.0 working groups some of the

868
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:28,279
endpoint data collection and and oval

869
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:32,180
authoring you know groups to

870
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,100
to see how that flies again I've got no

871
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:39,069
problems doing that I was at those

872
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:41,150
workshops as well keep building more

873
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:43,400
collection capabilities based on the

874
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:46,040
different data models start looking at

875
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,590
perhaps some hackathons where we can

876
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,509
store Paul actual policy and actual

877
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,490
definitions and tests and things like

878
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,380
that to be able to take that data

879
00:45:52,490 --> 00:46:00,589
downstream and actually do some

880
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:04,730
evaluation on it yeah last big thing

881
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:07,370
again for karl-heinz hopefully some

882
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:11,690
folks named Hank will take those

883
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:15,020
messages back of thanks to him and again

884
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:18,110
for staying up really late Hank I'll say

885
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:19,850
was also pretty instrumental in enabling

886
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:22,730
some of our collaboration and getting

887
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:24,860
going to really get this hackathon off

888
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:29,500
the ground so I really appreciate that

889
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:34,190
so thanks to Hank and I think that's it

890
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:36,290
yep hi this is student first of all bill

891
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,900
thanks for all the work that you did and

892
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:40,520
for all work to Carleton you know I was

893
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,320
there at the hackathon and you guys were

894
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,210
working hard the entire time you got a

895
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,450
ton done and it was cool to kind of see

896
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:50,720
the alpha with that on the desk at front

897
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,640
I think that just kind of acting as a

898
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,620
liaison for that effort I think that

899
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,540
even this presentation would be more

900
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,210
than welcome in something like the

901
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,980
endpoint collection group shirk and and

902
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,240
if we could work something out and even

903
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:08,800
organize something like that I think

904
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:12,890
okay great awesome so this is the thing

905
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,830
thanks for the excellent overview and I

906
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,740
think this is a this is repeating too a

907
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,230
lot of the things we were storming at

908
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:23,509
they mentioned operations like the extra

909
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,340
things we need the architecture to

910
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:29,060
define how to interact with other

911
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:31,940
components we have to start leading

912
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:34,310
different data models that we could show

913
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,280
interoperability okay two items on the

914
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:40,340
city data side yet but it is a proof of

915
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,990
concept so if you can - we can all it's

916
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,270
baby

917
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,189
the concept is dumb system I'll know

918
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,460
there's a select work of creating be

919
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:52,450
missing CD dl-44 the symmetric metric

920
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:56,260
and connection works like common areas

921
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:58,868
and recipe from XML to CD d ln back and

922
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,460
there was no loss all the time so

923
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:03,040
basically we have its operability

924
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,530
plugfest achieving right now and that is

925
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,810
I think the a very important thing here

926
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,640
but there is actually something coming

927
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:11,680
out of this only with respect to code

928
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,470
and yeah it's plugging and working but

929
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,660
we have found the basis to create the

930
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:19,689
actual data model that it will be able

931
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:21,700
to view multiple protocols and that we

932
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,520
can now understand better what

933
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,580
orchestration really looks like and if

934
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,720
we do this again and then maybe again

935
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,460
probably aware that going to be compete

936
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,740
because let's stop working at this

937
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,440
between yes this will be ongoing work

938
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,959
and therefore we will not rely on the

939
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,300
echo fonts alone thank you

940
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,300
I'd say that might also be worth

941
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,310
exploring just from my perspective and

942
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,890
not knowing necessarily T too much about

943
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:51,430
how the the CDL would be built to maybe

944
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:53,500
see if it's there's a more generic way

945
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,990
to represent it so we don't have to keep

946
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:59,470
expanding it and we can represent the

947
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,729
oval data for example in some you know

948
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,970
something that doesn't necessarily

949
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:07,210
always need a lot of modification you

950
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:09,250
know if you don't have a CDA parlors of

951
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:12,220
the code has to represent the

952
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,470
specification all the boils down that we

953
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,359
needed a CD deposit that then creates

954
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,970
classes you can instantiate for the code

955
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:21,190
that is basically right yeah yeah we

956
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,049
have that on multiple fronts we could

957
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:32,470
have fun see unfortunately not in Java

958
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:34,930
first but it is almost sweet I think any

959
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:49,180
other questions no thank you very much

960
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:53,560
Berlin thanks to Carla hey how much time

961
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,819
do I have as fast as I can okay you got

962
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,220
it

963
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:59,920
cool sacrum architecture this actually

964
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,930
probably won't take very long

965
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,900
there's some pending changes to the

966
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:08,430
draft that bill and I are making we want

967
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,539
to remove the XMP base xmpp based

968
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:14,279
solution from the draft pretty much

969
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:17,020
entirely right now in the unpublished

970
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:19,420
like in the github my we moved it to an

971
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:21,788
appendix depending on what people say it

972
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:24,130
belongs or it doesn't if nobody has an

973
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:25,599
opinion will yank it maybe we will put

974
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,559
it into a separate draft if that makes

975
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,359
sense

976
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,849
we want to combine the current section

977
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:34,630
3.1 with the current section four which

978
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:36,910
becomes the new section three and we'd

979
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,559
like to narrow the focus to a single

980
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:40,240
workflow and though the one we are

981
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,099
happened to be most familiar with is

982
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,649
basically configuration management

983
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:46,119
configuration assessment right which is

984
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:48,400
still state assessment when it boils

985
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:51,279
down to everything and then a few

986
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,890
clarifications as covered on subsequent

987
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:55,599
slides

988
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,848
there's Enterprise boundaries mentioned

989
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,380
in the draft and what we didn't want was

990
00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:04,690
that to be inferred as being traditional

991
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,720
endpoints only so really it wasn't

992
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:09,940
intended to indicate only on-prem stuff

993
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,439
it's supposed to also mean you know

994
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,319
anything that the enterprise has to

995
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,180
operate whether they actually own that

996
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,700
infrastructure or if it's shared

997
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,710
infrastructure or what-have-you

998
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,799
so it was one clarification we're gonna

999
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:26,859
make another clarification this one's

1000
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:28,359
probably more important is talking a

1001
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:31,630
little more about capability versus

1002
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:33,640
interface versus operations before I get

1003
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:36,130
into those three things you might

1004
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,348
consider interface and operation combine

1005
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,329
at the abstract level to be like an

1006
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:43,599
interaction between different components

1007
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:45,460
that have various capabilities but

1008
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,220
essentially what we want to be able to

1009
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:50,230
say for a capability as some product can

1010
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:52,419
assess like it says in the little

1011
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:55,569
sub-bullet product foo can assess

1012
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:59,079
configuration for windows/mac and AWS

1013
00:51:55,569 --> 00:52:00,819
using oval 511 to that we want to be

1014
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:04,089
able to express that between components

1015
00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:05,380
so that they know where to go when they

1016
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:08,310
have something that needs to be done

1017
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:11,550
with one of those classes of Tecna

1018
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:13,380
essentially for an interface we want to

1019
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:17,550
be able to say configuration assessment

1020
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,230
of Windows 10 using oval 5.11 - that's

1021
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,970
an interface that basically implements

1022
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:24,480
that to some degree right does that make

1023
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:27,509
sense uh we want to be able to specify

1024
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,640
interfaces at that level eventually and

1025
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,840
right probably in the solution level and

1026
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,379
maybe not the high level architecture

1027
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,090
[Applause]

1028
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,350
operations I want to gather system

1029
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:39,540
characteristics from Windows 10

1030
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,640
basically you're telling something go

1031
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,759
collect this information right that's

1032
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,350
essentially an operation we'll put some

1033
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,740
clarification in the draft around these

1034
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:53,910
things and people can comment and

1035
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:55,169
complain maybe I don't know the self

1036
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,149
architecture is we did want to talk

1037
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:59,070
about that a little bit too just to make

1038
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,650
it clear it's it the overall sacrum

1039
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,570
architecture kind of does have this dual

1040
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,700
nature in terms of sub architectures

1041
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:10,200
that there's collection subsystems right

1042
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:14,910
so like the EPC e vcp right

1043
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,750
EPC P draft ACP formerly easy feature is

1044
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:20,520
a collection of sub architecture and

1045
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:23,580
this sack of architecture supports that

1046
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,910
it also supports the idea of gang push

1047
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:28,190
or using an oval based system that

1048
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,859
doesn't go through

1049
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:33,390
EPC P right it's it's intended to

1050
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,680
support all of these things so we kind

1051
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,740
of call those the collection

1052
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,529
architectures collector subsystems and

1053
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:42,299
then above that so to speak is more of

1054
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,440
the cooperative tooling which is what we

1055
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,620
talked about at the beginning when

1056
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,390
Kathleen I was talking about you know

1057
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,790
what we're doing here basically right so

1058
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,529
the the co-operative tooling

1059
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,779
architecture is essentially how did all

1060
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,660
these different components in a standard

1061
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:01,170
standardize away start to talk to each

1062
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:07,049
other without a lot of operator

1063
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:09,120
intervention if any if as possible yes

1064
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,830
we want to clarify components so I

1065
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,920
mentioned we're initially focusing on

1066
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:17,400
configure configuration management we

1067
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,170
will propose specific components and

1068
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,780
we'll provide some descriptive details

1069
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,240
for each of those components into

1070
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,760
have their capabilities the interactions

1071
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,770
they have between each other and even

1072
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,320
the different types of interaction so in

1073
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:34,680
the hackathon for example they had

1074
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,810
pub/sub they used IQ which is I believe

1075
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,149
query response and then they had message

1076
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:41,400
which is just you send it and unless you

1077
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,910
hear something bad you assume it went

1078
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,570
well

1079
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:47,879
right so there are those different ways

1080
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,800
of dealing with these workflows right so

1081
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,450
we're gonna kind of talk about how we do

1082
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,220
that as well with configuration

1083
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:57,569
management with specific proposed

1084
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,350
components there are two open questions

1085
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,540
in the draft

1086
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,940
I should workflows be documented in the

1087
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,590
draft or in separate drafts we're gonna

1088
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,780
start in the draft and if we need to

1089
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,480
we'll move it out a same thing for

1090
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,700
interfaces or interactions basically

1091
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,580
we'll start in the draft and move them

1092
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,470
out when it's necessary so basically the

1093
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,630
more detailed it becomes I think then it

1094
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:20,129
becomes more of a solution and once it

1095
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,680
crosses that line or ever there'll I

1096
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:28,290
might be we can move that into a sub

1097
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:38,339
draft that's it I don't have a question

1098
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:41,970
slide so it just doesn't move I think I

1099
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:48,360
a rarely say this but been my most

1100
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:52,410
emergency fire are resolved I will join

1101
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:55,350
again and with the operation routine you

1102
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,480
got the architecture yeah I can do that

1103
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:00,150
I will have a plenty of time something

1104
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:04,020
ago September so because then the most

1105
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:07,290
more things on place and then I could

1106
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:10,890
actually okay so yeah that's good so I

1107
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:13,290
think my intent is to publish this

1108
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:17,190
before I go on holiday which is Sunday

1109
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:19,380
so so hopefully we'll be able to publish

1110
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,420
it update you guys can can give it a

1111
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,810
read it because we moved a bunch of

1112
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:28,010
stuff out it won't be very long and I'm

1113
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:30,509
lending on Saturday a vacation Sunday

1114
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:31,980
well it's good be treating rain it

1115
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:34,340
didn't somebody say that I'll be

1116
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,340
tweeting

1117
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:41,329
right our today's you know Texas

1118
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:43,999
sanction for the plantation so I have

1119
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:52,099
three points one is very minor one who

1120
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:55,759
can come back to your diagram which I

1121
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:57,739
well yes this one's okay just to say

1122
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:59,390
that I see it in five minutes to

1123
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:00,950
understand the grass things on the right

1124
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:11,180
side cuz I'm colorblind

1125
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:12,950
so sorry so now more seriously you you

1126
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,339
have a slider about some kind of

1127
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:21,439
expressions see you have a slide with

1128
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:23,420
some kind of expressions yes this one so

1129
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,480
I am new at completely new here so I'm

1130
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:29,239
really completely naive are you

1131
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,749
referring to a very formal expression on

1132
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:34,190
which year that should be at all no I

1133
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:37,730
honestly no I'm not I'm not necessarily

1134
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:39,650
thinking that I mean if we could get to

1135
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:42,680
that point I think that could help but

1136
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:44,779
this was really just trying to be more

1137
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,819
pedantic about defining these things

1138
00:57:44,779 --> 00:57:49,489
that recall capability and interphase in

1139
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:51,589
operation right so actually my point is

1140
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:54,950
that it's not pedantic it's really

1141
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:58,970
important I think I said I because I am

1142
00:57:54,950 --> 00:58:03,200
chairman and I knew as g17 and we

1143
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:06,379
recently had a person who came is a new

1144
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,049
work item for a universal syntax for

1145
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:11,930
secret expression then that was quite

1146
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:14,420
remarkable we start to work on that and

1147
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:16,730
an associate is he's a lot of benefit I

1148
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:19,220
think actually he started to present to

1149
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,589
21 cos he and others to see is

1150
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:24,558
organization as well so maybe there are

1151
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:27,259
dots to connect I think it's really

1152
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,880
mattered because it's only when you stop

1153
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:31,700
to go at that letter that you can add

1154
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,279
many other benefits in terms of you know

1155
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,640
when you have to do your audit is your

1156
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:38,930
stink because we can really make this

1157
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,740
professional so I really appreciate the

1158
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:45,980
link as well knowing that is

1159
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:49,939
so network certainly be interesting to

1160
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:52,250
that mix happy to perhaps if the new

1161
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,960
item gets approved maybe miss enemies of

1162
00:58:52,250 --> 00:59:02,450
statement with is it a weight that you

1163
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:04,730
guys work here or sorry like go simply

1164
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:06,379
too deep there may be eyes you could see

1165
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:13,119
Medicare we have such would that work

1166
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:16,490
about that purely informational okay

1167
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,520
right so that's that's that's the really

1168
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:20,750
interesting point here

1169
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,730
the second piece related to does

1170
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:24,500
anything we just add so it's just a

1171
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,440
remark to myself that now I understand

1172
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:30,320
that really I need to put on my work

1173
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,730
program to understand better what you

1174
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,980
guys are doing here because now I start

1175
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:38,869
to feel the ring possible between your

1176
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:43,550
work and endpoint and and and I really

1177
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:47,210
an intuition there is more wish I mean

1178
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:50,330
there is motive locally proposed but let

1179
00:59:47,210 --> 01:00:06,530
me know what you guys are doing better

1180
00:59:50,330 --> 01:00:09,319
and then so just one quick thing

1181
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:15,580
oh because I know Romans gonna have us

1182
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:17,900
come back to this updated milestones so

1183
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,609
the only milestone we actually have

1184
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,170
associated with this on our milestones

1185
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:26,000
right now is to submit an initial draft

1186
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:28,369
which we have met do we have any sense

1187
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,730
of when we'd be ready to to how close do

1188
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:33,260
we how many III mean no the only reason

1189
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,450
if you'll recall the reason why the only

1190
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:38,869
milestone we have is because we were

1191
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:41,359
really hesitant to restart the work so

1192
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:46,130
do we think we're a year away from being

1193
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:52,640
done or six months or I honestly hope

1194
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:54,500
not I mean not a years I mean so so the

1195
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,920
the way it's shaping up really is to be

1196
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,690
the more abstract they

1197
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,109
so I think we talked about this a little

1198
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:06,299
bit where what what the intent of the

1199
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:09,660
draft is is to specify I don't okay it's

1200
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:12,359
describing an abstract architecture that

1201
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:14,879
is intended to provide the messaging

1202
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:19,200
infrastructure necessary for sending

1203
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:22,760
some payload right at this point I care

1204
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:27,029
very little about what that payload is

1205
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:29,010
I'm just saying okay I mean so it's so

1206
01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:32,099
like when you look at the the XMPP the

1207
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:34,829
actual solution right we shoved ovale

1208
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:37,200
through there then you know CD deal

1209
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:41,010
whatever it was right and it came back

1210
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,828
out that could easily be io def it could

1211
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:48,170
be anything right that some of the

1212
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:48,170
semantics and and constructs and

1213
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,670
necessary things for like even

1214
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:55,260
configuration management right so that

1215
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:58,109
if you're an Orchestrator and you're

1216
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,690
telling a collector I want you to

1217
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:02,759
collect something you're saying you're

1218
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:05,250
telling it collect this piece of

1219
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:07,170
information that's one way to do it you

1220
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:09,930
could also say watch this information

1221
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:11,789
from the architecture perspective at

1222
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:14,180
this level I don't care which one

1223
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:16,890
they're saying that's inside the payload

1224
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,990
they understand that by capabilities

1225
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:21,690
right so we're trying to say how do they

1226
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:23,939
each one of each component one of the

1227
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:27,329
components how do they express their

1228
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,650
capabilities to each other and then how

1229
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:30,869
do they know what language they're gonna

1230
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:32,880
speak within those payloads and then

1231
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:35,420
we're done exactly yeah what it doesn't

1232
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,950
say yeah you have to have to the

1233
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:43,319
architecture have to have a place that

1234
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:45,118
defines how to express what is the

1235
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:47,279
language you're just speaking because

1236
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,220
otherwise it is gibberish so that has to

1237
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:51,960
be orchestrated and therefore is on the

1238
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:53,848
architecture level itself then I say

1239
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,920
that the data model stuff is totally

1240
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:58,200
opaque to you you don't care and correct

1241
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,970
and that is a correct thing yes

1242
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,769
excellent I was just looking for a date

1243
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:02,970
so you don't want it to be a year so

1244
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:08,200
you'd like it I don't do days

1245
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:11,270
[Laughter]

1246
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,549
two meanings let's say that yeah okay

1247
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:16,730
two meetings I'd like to be optimistic

1248
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:20,150
and say that we'd be so no two meetings

1249
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:22,580
you right now so we can know we'll do

1250
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:25,160
working group last call February 2020

1251
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,200
okay that gives us a meeting and a half

1252
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,940
and that means we'd be reviewing working

1253
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,200
group last call comments in the context

1254
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,200
of two meetings from now how's that

1255
01:03:44,560 --> 01:04:06,950
I think it there is no there was an

1256
01:03:54,170 --> 01:04:19,010
initial draft one am I not I'm not

1257
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:22,819
seeing this oh I did find it sorry I

1258
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:24,880
reloaded it it was not there before was

1259
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:27,170
it no see

1260
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,200
okay so we're going making that one

1261
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:35,540
February 2020 that's only a couple

1262
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:39,439
months okay so that's our protection two

1263
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:39,770
extra months that gets you through the

1264
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,270
holidays

1265
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:43,270
okay so moving on thank you very much

1266
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:58,339
information well it's you can we talk

1267
01:04:48,680 --> 01:05:02,660
about the other things on that I just

1268
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:03,860
want to say what Adam said I said okay

1269
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,440
so I'm just gonna go over the

1270
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:10,180
information while I posted a really

1271
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:14,140
rough small short draft it really just

1272
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:16,910
kind of shockingly basic graph submitted

1273
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:20,660
it has a him full field

1274
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:23,569
to describe the different elements this

1275
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:26,000
is there's one interesting thing in here

1276
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:29,509
but I'll come back to it well I'll come

1277
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,059
back to it right now so what's in the

1278
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:34,670
draft right now is only a handful of

1279
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:37,579
elements it's really aimed at kind of

1280
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:43,250
what Adam and Hank just agreed to which

1281
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:44,930
is how do you enable kind of saying

1282
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,029
here's an endpoint here's what the

1283
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:49,640
endpoints capabilities are are here an

1284
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:51,380
endpoint here's an interface so I'll

1285
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,990
stick to Adams terminology to the best

1286
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,599
of my ability while I speak here's an

1287
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:59,269
interface here's the interfaces

1288
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:02,029
capabilities and then there's a little

1289
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:09,890
bit of you know some kind of command

1290
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:15,799
type stuff in there so I added composite

1291
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:17,450
structure type notion in this so this is

1292
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:19,819
information model so this is still a

1293
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:22,160
high level but I haven't used it yet I

1294
01:06:19,819 --> 01:06:26,440
can envision that people might want it

1295
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,440
but I'm not sure if I should keep it

1296
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,849
okay there's one vote for keeping it

1297
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:45,299
[Music]

1298
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:10,430
I'm gonna keep doing this from the

1299
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:14,070
chairs desk for a second Wow sorry

1300
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:15,720
yeah so I mean there's one vote to keep

1301
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:18,300
it it's that would really be about

1302
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:22,109
future proofing this but I could imagine

1303
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:23,280
its usefulness especially if you you

1304
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:25,790
know have any kind of version where you

1305
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,660
want to do a compound version of a host

1306
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:32,820
but I haven't done anything like that

1307
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:37,100
yet so another idea that's in there is

1308
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:42,000
the idea of opaque an opaque information

1309
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:45,770
field and so this is really kind of the

1310
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,500
basic description and so I have

1311
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:52,410
communicated with Bill some I needed to

1312
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:54,330
kind of finish this but which is right

1313
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:56,370
now this is basically the thing that

1314
01:07:54,330 --> 01:08:00,900
would have an envelope of some other

1315
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:03,989
type of data in the in the information

1316
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,989
[Music]

1317
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:15,720
thank you so there's pros and cons to

1318
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:18,630
this in my opinion into opinions on what

1319
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,569
we should do here are also welcome so if

1320
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:24,990
if I allow any kind of opaque element

1321
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:27,269
and let you to transfer anything as you

1322
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:29,160
know just kind of a blob within in the

1323
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,200
structure then there's very little

1324
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,930
motivation to standardize more elements

1325
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:36,359
on the flip side to kind of Brett's

1326
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:38,580
comment from before this potentially

1327
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:39,839
lowers the bar very much to doing any

1328
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,580
kind of implementation because there's

1329
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,110
only a handful of fields you need to put

1330
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,309
in and then you can put in your blob as

1331
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:57,000
long as the other person knows what the

1332
01:08:44,310 --> 01:09:00,990
blob is Hank I am frowning at length on

1333
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:05,850
the information that's an implementation

1334
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:09,359
specific problem so what I have so far

1335
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:10,150
has nothing with regards to how you

1336
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,790
would

1337
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:14,698
we really represent the data or do any

1338
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:18,549
kind of serialization deserialization

1339
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:22,960
but it does let you for me octet lengths

1340
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:25,929
does let me think about kind of the you

1341
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:30,158
know what the elements you know what I

1342
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:33,370
what I'm dealing with for you oh you're

1343
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:36,670
forcing them to binary so it's a data

1344
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:38,370
model thing and I would touch that fair

1345
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:44,219
enough fair enough

1346
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:44,219
true I don't know if I your comments Val

1347
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:52,389
alright so another kind of thing I'd

1348
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:57,909
like some feedback on so I just have a

1349
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:59,170
handful of really I mean I just sue most

1350
01:09:57,909 --> 01:10:01,360
of the document was actually written but

1351
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:04,000
I added this after I talked to Adam in

1352
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,799
bill so that was this week

1353
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,750
lucky for me I didn't post anything till

1354
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:12,540
this week so you didn't know that I

1355
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:16,870
added one assessment assessment result

1356
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:18,790
capability to discover or obviously I

1357
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:20,440
also have to be you know some kind of

1358
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:23,699
version of how you do those negotiations

1359
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:28,389
I envision some kind of enumerations

1360
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:31,659
that would be I in a register of you

1361
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:33,670
know the types of data formats that

1362
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:36,549
could be exchanged in those ok cap

1363
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:38,350
envelopes I don't think that's a

1364
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:40,929
complete list of commands I don't want

1365
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:43,630
I'm incapable of getting too far ahead

1366
01:10:40,929 --> 01:10:45,280
of of say bill in and karl-heinz and

1367
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:50,020
anybody else who wants to participate so

1368
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:55,929
I will by necessity lag them somewhat

1369
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:59,949
hopefully by not too much say that you

1370
01:10:55,929 --> 01:11:01,750
know what you have is kind of in the

1371
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:04,269
same vein as things that Adam and I have

1372
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:06,810
discussed about things to put in

1373
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:10,030
architecture as well so we can more Nina

1374
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:12,580
you know that that is absolutely the the

1375
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:15,070
goal and and I'm tracking what you guys

1376
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:17,380
are doing as to what I put in here so I

1377
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:19,420
obviously do want the information model

1378
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:25,720
to align and I'm paying attention

1379
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:27,970
good for me what I am a chair as it

1380
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:30,130
turns out yeah which means you know I

1381
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:35,530
don't have to beat myself although maybe

1382
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:37,330
I do to read everything this is the only

1383
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:40,929
place where I'm using a list currently

1384
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:42,460
so there's at least in the current

1385
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:44,110
version of the information model there's

1386
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,670
one thing that's the command and then

1387
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:47,740
there's an Associated list which could

1388
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:50,230
be the parameters in the return types I

1389
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,610
don't know if that's the same way to do

1390
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:53,830
it I don't know if that's great in the

1391
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:58,200
information model but that's what it is

1392
01:11:53,830 --> 01:12:01,480
right now and I'm happy to accept

1393
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:04,990
people's better wisdom so this is

1394
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:08,290
generally our Macdonald Carsten would

1395
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:14,559
say that opaque was the ex name mistake

1396
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:16,210
happening again yeah but I think I would

1397
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:21,670
have agreed with that one I described

1398
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:23,370
the opaque type upfront it's exactly the

1399
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:28,090
same yeah it's a nice yeah

1400
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:30,760
no I know but so he's listening so I

1401
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:35,620
would agree with him in that yeah the ex

1402
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:37,720
name is I would have the opaque the

1403
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:42,340
opaque is tight and I that would become

1404
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:44,940
a registry so it's only half or

1405
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:55,360
three-quarters as bad as the it has the

1406
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:58,480
X header I think Kirsten might be saying

1407
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:02,139
talking about ECP 178 which talks about

1408
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:04,419
not using like hex names because he gave

1409
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:09,190
the same comment on Kara it's why I

1410
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:13,210
looked it up I think that's the I have

1411
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:15,009
to look that up but yeah for me a little

1412
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:17,710
bit of chicken in the egg right because

1413
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:22,960
I think we're gonna exchange over an ARF

1414
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:26,230
and maybe some some version of concise

1415
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,880
map or if' map or those kinds of things

1416
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:30,120
and I don't know how to square that

1417
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,120
circle

1418
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:38,870
yeah and that was kind of it and so this

1419
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:41,989
is the kind of feedback that I'd like to

1420
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:44,929
get from you guys and obviously I mean I

1421
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:46,610
know bill on Adam and I have talked and

1422
01:13:44,929 --> 01:13:49,100
I will continue to talk and follow what

1423
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:51,650
you guys are putting in there but that's

1424
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:54,050
the that's the gist of where this is

1425
01:13:51,650 --> 01:14:00,888
heading and I'm happy to have people

1426
01:13:54,050 --> 01:14:02,360
help that so we have about two minutes

1427
01:14:00,889 --> 01:14:06,230
for discussing this

1428
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:07,880
any questions comments I would agree to

1429
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:09,919
the same milestone that Adam agreed to

1430
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,659
so I know it was just posted today

1431
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,940
you'll agree to the same milestone that

1432
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:25,190
Adam did yes Adam was working group last

1433
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:27,980
call are you serious yeah okay which is

1434
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:29,780
because vibha really was cold and have

1435
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:33,799
proof of concept and it's actually by

1436
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:37,519
over then again I see your start with

1437
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,860
addresses first and always I'm a big fan

1438
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,750
of lecture on amis so maybe have the

1439
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,820
categories again and saying this is

1440
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:47,480
addresses intended to be used as

1441
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:54,199
identifiers isn't yada yada yada baby so

1442
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:56,718
I actually do have something so I had

1443
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:58,309
some sort of category I guess I have

1444
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,139
something that's kind of data use type

1445
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:08,540
and so I can change that to category oh

1446
01:15:00,139 --> 01:15:10,820
yeah I see oh I just real quick so on

1447
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:14,000
architecture is happy to collaborate I

1448
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:16,040
know that we intend to establish some

1449
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,900
registries your draft says it's gonna

1450
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:20,269
establish some registries we should at

1451
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:24,679
least collaborate for that right yeah

1452
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:27,260
absolutely and I they I assume some of

1453
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:30,739
them will be the same they only need to

1454
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:34,520
show up once so I just want to go back

1455
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:36,409
to milestones room huh yeah that was my

1456
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:41,330
point

1457
01:15:36,409 --> 01:15:42,860
yeah you know what we'll get there so so

1458
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:45,139
I was going to suggest that perhaps the

1459
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:46,670
initial draft would be a dot the initial

1460
01:15:45,139 --> 01:15:52,040
milestone would be adopted as a working

1461
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:53,300
group document and maybe we would set

1462
01:15:52,040 --> 01:16:00,980
that for maybe September

1463
01:15:53,300 --> 01:16:03,770
okay okay all right

1464
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:09,949
so I think no more questions on thank

1465
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:13,969
you very much for putting this in so the

1466
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:15,650
next thing is next steps and I think the

1467
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:19,340
first thing that we're going to need to

1468
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:20,960
do real quickly is our area director has

1469
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,400
asked us to look at our milestones which

1470
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,199
were at the beginning of this meeting

1471
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,710
awfully out of date but some of them

1472
01:16:24,199 --> 01:16:31,219
have now been updated

1473
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:37,370
we have been so the questions I have for

1474
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:39,020
you all were so I that we said that the

1475
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:45,290
early software descriptor and coast

1476
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:48,500
would to August 2019 to go to iesg we

1477
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:51,500
did 2024 working group last call of the

1478
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:56,840
sacrum architecture we actually need to

1479
01:16:51,500 --> 01:17:03,340
put a milestone in for the EPC P to the

1480
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:03,340
IES G so we will put that one in for

1481
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:15,620
September of a second see Jess just

1482
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,120
September of 2019 you think that's we

1483
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:21,080
can do October if you think that would

1484
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:26,210
be a little let's go for October well

1485
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:40,519
you did get what wasn't 96 or 97 97 last

1486
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:42,139
minute comments imagine that okay so so

1487
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,150
that actually leaves three things that

1488
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:45,380
are on our current list of months so we

1489
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,759
need to add a milestone for the

1490
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:49,900
information model because we currently

1491
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,900
don't have that as a milestone

1492
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:55,030
and that leaves three things that we

1493
01:17:51,590 --> 01:18:02,300
don't actually have anything related to

1494
01:17:55,030 --> 01:18:04,370
I warned them earlier that I might

1495
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:10,370
separate them if they didn't stop

1496
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:17,809
talking okay so the Roly configuration

1497
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:20,599
checklist so the draft expired a long

1498
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:28,040
time ago and I haven't made any updates

1499
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:30,710
to it at this time I don't have a 100%

1500
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,380
certain answer either way as to the fate

1501
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:35,930
of that document moving forward if I can

1502
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:38,650
find the time I would certainly like to

1503
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:38,650
work on it more

1504
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:55,070
they're really software configuration

1505
01:18:50,270 --> 01:19:03,170
checklist Roman did it again I mean do

1506
01:18:55,070 --> 01:19:17,200
people still want to do this Adam had

1507
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:17,200
this maybe Tom's the answer maybe

1508
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:32,570
Hey I guess this is Bill I guess it's

1509
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:36,469
for the the early checklist one I would

1510
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:40,160
I know you got a template for like

1511
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:42,280
basically how it would be done and so

1512
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,660
that that makes it a lot easier

1513
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:49,040
straightforward the only complication

1514
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:51,830
with that is just scope what you meet my

1515
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:55,250
checklist is that an XD CDF is that a

1516
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:58,190
data stream collection what is that what

1517
01:19:55,250 --> 01:20:00,350
is that is it is it all of them so the

1518
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:03,200
more formats that you can express the

1519
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:10,640
checklist the obviously the more

1520
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:16,429
complicated it makes it so let me say

1521
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:19,820
that because I think that if I were to

1522
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:21,470
get the bulk of that text down and then

1523
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:24,080
maybe come and talk to you guys instead

1524
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:26,540
for just that technical filling in those

1525
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:29,570
technical fields that detail like once I

1526
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:31,850
say oh we're gonna put X CCDF in it come

1527
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:33,799
and talk to you and say well what fields

1528
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:35,960
or what things inside of X EDF would be

1529
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:39,800
important to take out I think that's a

1530
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:43,130
pretty small lift I can do the pros so I

1531
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:46,700
think there's between us enough interest

1532
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,470
in effort to get an update down okay in

1533
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:54,019
terms of milestones I think what you're

1534
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:59,090
asking okay I can have a fresh version

1535
01:20:54,020 --> 01:21:02,860
of the draft with probably input from

1536
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:02,860
these guys for the next meeting

1537
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:18,019
I think you've okay we want to talk

1538
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:21,080
about is not the next draft what do we

1539
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:22,700
think we're going to well I think that

1540
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:26,360
maybe we should edit the milestone

1541
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:28,760
because at this point I think the point

1542
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:30,650
at which we had a date in there for

1543
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,020
submitting it to working group last call

1544
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:35,089
or submitting it to the iesg

1545
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,500
we had we had a document that we were

1546
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,480
currently I mean

1547
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:41,360
you come up with a milestone person for

1548
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,860
starting working group last call okay I

1549
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,839
wanted to do that but I don't feel it

1550
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:48,980
carry with the milestone like what we

1551
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:59,480
pick last whatever works you guys work

1552
01:21:48,980 --> 01:22:00,679
well I would never know because so I'm a

1553
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:02,360
part of this is do we have interesting

1554
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,540
doing it we have energy to do it

1555
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:10,580
do we defer it I mean be nice to be able

1556
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:15,710
to kind of have a plan they won't fire

1557
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:17,240
I'm willing to help you and and there's

1558
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:18,950
not much left to do from my

1559
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:21,050
understanding the last time I read it

1560
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:24,940
was maybe like six months ago but it

1561
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:24,940
looked like things were kind of there

1562
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:33,190
right and I have some expertise in those

1563
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:36,170
formats as well so I can help you maybe

1564
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:39,349
maybe you since you know I'm easy to

1565
01:22:36,170 --> 01:23:04,340
find for you I can help you but ELLs in

1566
01:22:39,350 --> 01:23:06,350
and then we have okay so maybe that

1567
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:08,990
means that can have something that could

1568
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:14,240
be ready for the group to review by the

1569
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:20,650
next meeting so so why don't we say

1570
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:23,000
submit to the is G in March of 2020 okay

1571
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:25,370
excellent

1572
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,080
so then there's two more drafts and

1573
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,940
actually the milestones are initial

1574
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,800
drafts and I haven't seen initial drafts

1575
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:34,610
on either one of them so perhaps we

1576
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,290
should defer these and that's the ECP

1577
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:46,549
over transfer and yang push over

1578
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:49,540
transfer mechanism interface so do we

1579
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:49,540
want to do this work

1580
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:58,099
yeni push is done the only thing I'm

1581
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:59,510
making this faces I didn't know that we

1582
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:04,460
planned for that I totally forgot about

1583
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:09,430
it was that so so little me yes it's a

1584
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:15,200
valid producer of information and I

1585
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:18,590
assume that we can revive that when we

1586
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:20,150
are at the place in the architecture

1587
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:23,000
that has the appropriate set of

1588
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:26,059
operations to initiate that so I would

1589
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,650
assume after the next meeting we can

1590
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:35,410
start working on that effectively before

1591
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:38,120
that it is just wishful thinking so but

1592
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:40,430
but it is still something that that yeah

1593
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,320
we think we should do so after the next

1594
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:54,200
meeting so maybe initial draft in

1595
01:24:42,320 --> 01:25:11,179
February 2020 and during that phase we

1596
01:24:54,200 --> 01:25:20,900
can initiate draft have a 0-0 next house

1597
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:22,430
integrators so all I want is a thumbs up

1598
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,990
thumbs down we're going to continue so

1599
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:28,010
thumbs up we're gonna continue it and

1600
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:33,740
we'll set a initial draft end of this

1601
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:34,340
year early next year end of this year is

1602
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:36,559
very likely

1603
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:39,380
okay so we'll make it January of 2020

1604
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:46,370
that way you'll have all of December all

1605
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:47,390
right and then the ECP one no no no that

1606
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:49,910
it's a different draft

1607
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:56,639
it's the ECP over transfer mechanism

1608
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:59,429
it's not the all right

1609
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:02,550
so we'll take that one to list okay so

1610
01:25:59,429 --> 01:26:06,630
that covers that covers all of our

1611
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:14,250
existing milestones Hank you only have

1612
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:33,239
to be quiet for four more minutes for

1613
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:38,250
the note C right yank push so then you

1614
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:40,019
airy 20/20 okay so then the one thing

1615
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:41,790
that was not there's two more things on

1616
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:43,320
the agenda one we're not going to talk

1617
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:47,760
about it but we need and we don't

1618
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:50,549
currently have it on our milestones but

1619
01:26:47,760 --> 01:27:01,650
there is still that terminology document

1620
01:26:50,550 --> 01:27:03,840
that has expired that it's actually if

1621
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:06,750
it sees the current scope we are pretty

1622
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,699
fine and you just have to revive it when

1623
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,929
the time is right and the architecture

1624
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:11,969
has a place to fit with the

1625
01:27:09,929 --> 01:27:15,570
characterization profile yet above

1626
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:18,210
you're starting on that so I think that

1627
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:20,900
the architecture is done we should be

1628
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:24,510
able to complete the terminology

1629
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:28,259
iteration later so give me four months

1630
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:32,670
after architecture okay architecture

1631
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:36,330
plus four alrighty so the last item i

1632
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:44,750
have i think that we have is scheduled

1633
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:47,010
going forward and well we will I mean

1634
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:48,389
for better for worse we seem to make

1635
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:49,639
better progress and we have virtual

1636
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:55,530
interims

1637
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:59,699
so I was thinking without at all

1638
01:27:55,530 --> 01:28:04,619
coordinating with my co-chair to virtual

1639
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:07,610
interims between now and the next

1640
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:10,650
meeting I was thinking early September

1641
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:13,559
early to mid October

1642
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:15,629
is there anything stands out really

1643
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:19,260
obviously like maybe the week of

1644
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:24,060
September 9th I'm looking at the week of

1645
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:27,570
September 9th September 16 or and then

1646
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:31,350
following that week of 7 October or 14

1647
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:31,969
October and so none of you all see any

1648
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:37,670
major

1649
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:37,670
okay so schedule 2 virtual interims

1650
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:44,600
anything else any other business

1651
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:53,330

1652
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:53,330
