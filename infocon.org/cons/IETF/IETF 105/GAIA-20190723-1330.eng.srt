00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:24,080
this is Gaia and I'm Jane and this is

13
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:27,080
Leandro hi you can follow along on line

14
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,690
with the agenda first up for every

15
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,280
meeting here at the IETF is that the

16
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,310
blue sheets are circulating please sign

17
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,729
in and that we have to remind you of the

18
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,840
note well you can take a look online

19
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,240
I've been told that I don't have to go

20
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,219
through the whole thing so it's up to

21
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,110
you to take a look but you should know

22
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,820
this by now first up for our meeting and

23
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,300
I and I I'm gonna turn it over to

24
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,010
Leandro to do a quick intro this group

25
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,660
was started many years ago to take a

26
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,960
look at connectivity and hard to reach

27
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,550
places underserved areas places where

28
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,140
you know at least 49 percent of the

29
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,180
population of the planet are not

30
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,969
connected so we bring in different

31
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,919
experts to talk about ways to look at

32
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,870
building anything from community

33
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,870
networks to internet exchange points

34
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,720
local wireless Wi-Fi mesh whatever works

35
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,160
and some of the some of the people in

36
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,050
the room here are part of the

37
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,450
participate in battle mesh where they

38
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,830
hack mesh standards they've deployed

39
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,229
community networks which are both

40
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,789
wireless Wi-Fi and fiber which is grief

41
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,200
II which is the network that Leandro

42
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,849
works with we also have with us today

43
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,409
people from ripe ncc to talk about what

44
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,630
they're doing to help communities of

45
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,250
interest with network operator groups we

46
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,020
have a colleague from a tribal community

47
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,990
he and the United States that works with

48
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,820
19 different indigenous tribes looking

49
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,350
at connectivity and how to create

50
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,409
sustainable networks that are more

51
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,910
community built rather than last mile so

52
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,590
I'm going to turn to Leandro for a sec

53
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,940
for a bit more of an introduction while

54
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,940
we get people queued up

55
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,149
well hi everyone

56
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:07,909
there are several like housekeeping

57
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:12,709
things one is I mean there are remote

58
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:14,209
participants today there is the if you

59
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:16,339
look at the agenda you will see the in

60
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:20,119
there is one link to a etherpad

61
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:22,039
where we collect notes so you're very

62
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:26,599
welcome to go there and to contribute

63
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,789
text we try to collect a summary of the

64
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,188
discussion over there I will be there

65
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,659
taking notes but I mean anyone else is

66
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,149
welcome

67
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:38,800
there's also jabber group you can also

68
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:43,249
join and either through meet echo or

69
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,740
through a some XMPP client people can

70
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:48,490
also ask questions over there and then

71
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,580
just going directly to the introduction

72
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,580
there's so many screens in our table so

73
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,679
the slides are the ID will be able to

74
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,628
download them later on and the objective

75
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:01,549
of the interaction just to give a bit of

76
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:05,269
context for those who are new to the

77
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,129
group this comes from the web page from

78
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:10,369
the group in in the IRT EFT on our

79
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:14,930
website and well it says that this is

80
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:19,430
started back in 2012 looking at the the

81
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:24,349
access gap in and ways to to deal with

82
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:30,169
that so maybe and then this is a list of

83
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:33,050
objectives that because sometimes we you

84
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:35,240
forget about the as as we go as we share

85
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,699
information as we have presentations we

86
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,430
can forget about what why we started and

87
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,169
when I work with the aims so as you can

88
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,189
see is about increasing increased

89
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:49,430
visibility any interest so one of the

90
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:53,029
aim so of this working group is to share

91
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:55,839
to make visible different initiatives

92
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:59,479
very diverse but probably complementary

93
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,269
how to create together efficient that in

94
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,369
blog dimples many stakeholders how to

95
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:08,300
articulate and foster collaboration

96
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:10,569
among them including the the different

97
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,689
aspects which have to do with

98
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,300
what ITF does also the research part

99
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:20,409
what a ITF does and and also what

100
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:24,699
everyone of you do in your own context

101
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:27,459
and community another part is

102
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:31,509
documenting documenting and sharing

103
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:35,649
information either experiences or as

104
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:38,250
research results very important

105
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,539
sustainability is about documenting

106
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:45,100
different aspects which are critical for

107
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,110
for addressing the the unconnected or

108
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,459
improving the connectivity for those who

109
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,550
are connected and then to look at how

110
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:58,899
how the research part that we do can

111
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:01,060
translate into into the efforts that IDF

112
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:04,870
does in general so this is the list of

113
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:09,459
objectives and then for to contribute to

114
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:11,920
that today this is the agenda so without

115
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:15,609
much daud-you we will start with the

116
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:20,199
first presentation from the remote

117
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:22,149
presentation from ripe ncc it was

118
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,680
already one introductory or previous

119
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:31,259
presentation in a previous guided

120
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:36,040
session so let's see medium I'm here

121
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:39,759
great does that work can you give me yep

122
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,410
perfectly perfect Thanks well thanks for

123
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,899
having me and last time I was actually

124
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,279
there in person and I remember I was one

125
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,350
of the few people who didn't present

126
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,600
them remotely so now this time I'm also

127
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,410
going to present remotely from a

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,069
tropical Amsterdam at the moment

129
00:09:52,410 --> 00:10:01,149
so I'll tell you to change the slides

130
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:05,589
right is that how that works okay please

131
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:08,560
go ahead yes so for those of you don't

132
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:10,630
know the ripe NCC is mostly known for

133
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,329
its tasks as a regional internet

134
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,850
registry where I'm distributing our P

135
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,099
addresses and a s numbers and we are

136
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,420
located in Amsterdam this is the speak

137
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,889
building that's not our office it's

138
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,010
Central Station but we're located right

139
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,090
next to it beautifully central and so

140
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,280
damn

141
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,230
we have more than 20,000 members now and

142
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,480
which is mostly because we're running

143
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,580
out of ipv4 and everybody is trying to

144
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,420
get the last last blocks of before so

145
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,250
but you're doing in many other

146
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,170
activities like and last time I

147
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,500
presented maybe you can go to the next

148
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,620
and last time I present it mostly on our

149
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,900
data and tools that did we provide like

150
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,900
as a regional registry we have a lot of

151
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,540
data that we collect from our members as

152
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,630
part of the IP registry that we run and

153
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,329
maintain and operate and with that we

154
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,420
also offer a lot of tools for instance

155
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:07,570
like ripe stat or ipv6 measurements or

156
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,120
routing measurements that you make

157
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,190
available to everybody and we also have

158
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,900
another measurement platform that some

159
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,240
of you might know it's called web atlas

160
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,490
many of you actually help distributing

161
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,370
these probes and and and make them make

162
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,200
the network work better because the more

163
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,700
probes we have and the better I'm sure

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,500
there are a couple of ambassadors

165
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,180
running around the ITF also trying to

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,210
handle probes and all of this is

167
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:37,810
distract described the schedules on the

168
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:42,940
right laughs platform will have a big

169
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:45,040
echo at the moment now Alison last time

170
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,050
I also mentioned the information service

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,959
which is kind of a collector or from a

172
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,209
collection of route collectors that we

173
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,980
may collect the data and make available

174
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,110
and last time I was mentioning a new

175
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,750
service we had it's called Miss

176
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,360
livestream where you can basically

177
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,620
follow route changes and live in a

178
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
certain tool so if you're interested in

179
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,460
any of this I'm not going to talk about

180
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,990
that now there was all last time and you

181
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,050
can look at the slides from NASA and

182
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,480
this time you can move on please and

183
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,479
this time I got to talk more about what

184
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,600
we do for other other services that we

185
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,630
provide to the community next slide

186
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,089
please

187
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:28,210
where it's a bit of a mixed bag now of

188
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,950
various community projects that that we

189
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,240
run on basically supporting various

190
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,010
parts of the community

191
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,170
the first one is for network operators

192
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,090
groups and Jane said in her introduction

193
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,520
that obviously one of our main

194
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,730
communities and also most of our members

195
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,340
our network operators in there are some

196
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,320
form or fashion I mean doesn't it can

197
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,600
also be enterprises or a government

198
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,390
networks but mostly people who run

199
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,100
networks and so and more and more over

200
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,470
the last few years and and you'll

201
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,500
probably notice there's an increasing

202
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,900
number of more local network operators

203
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,780
groups all over the world almost like a

204
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,970
natural evolution that they kind of

205
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,839
started with maybe the regional logs

206
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:14,420
such as ripe and a frog and Latin organ

207
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,060
like what's a cult it's called VOC oh no

208
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,520
it was another world in latin america

209
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:23,270
and also we have right in europe

210
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,840
Narrogin us so now we have a wealth of

211
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:29,689
like more localized and maybe national

212
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,720
network operators groups sometimes even

213
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,100
citigroup select meetups and such and so

214
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,660
we thought it wouldn't be nice to have

215
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,020
like one site where all this information

216
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,819
is collected so we created a map you can

217
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,550
see there a screenshot and if you hover

218
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,830
over that as a link at the bottom if you

219
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,569
hover over the link you can you can see

220
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,220
the information of that well not on the

221
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,580
screen right now but then when you go to

222
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,350
that website you'll see a link to that

223
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,030
particular network operators group and

224
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,540
then you can find information about the

225
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:03,439
next meeting where they are you know how

226
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:06,140
you can contact them and and I'm some

227
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,270
people use this to find the local Naga

228
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,100
and then you can start participate on

229
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,710
that same page there's also like a whole

230
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,940
list of these of these groups and it's

231
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,340
not only as you can see it's not

232
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,130
restricted to the right service region

233
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,170
is like at lists all of the NOx that we

234
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,480
are aware of so if there are any more

235
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,839
than them please contact me and let us

236
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,760
know if you can go to the next slide I'm

237
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,170
their number of things that we can do

238
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,000
for network operators group because

239
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,040
you're kind of close to our heart almost

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,890
like a little mini mini right meetings

241
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,230
and and they're basically I'm carry the

242
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,750
you know the community messages on to

243
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,970
their local communities and so we are

244
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,180
happy to find speakers either from the

245
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,400
ripe NCC itself or also other community

246
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,130
speakers as we are we are in contact

247
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,449
with a lot of people

248
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,670
we sometimes can also provide

249
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,710
sponsorship and obviously we have a lot

250
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,290
of expertise and an experience in that

251
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,780
connecting people and them and helping

252
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,030
people to start such an ox for instance

253
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,310
have you recently also set up a mailing

254
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,959
list for the NOC organisers that's the

255
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:13,709
last point on that slide

256
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:16,000
it's a listed and we created not

257
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,970
necessarily for all the participants but

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,140
more for the for the problem committees

259
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,550
or organizing committee so that they can

260
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,199
exchange some information and it's

261
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,270
amazing you know how many different

262
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,330
shapes and forms these network operators

263
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,920
groups coming there are some that only

264
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,140
meet like a couple of hours in the

265
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,390
evening every few months other stuff

266
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,730
like two full day meetings for training

267
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,170
sessions everything and and it's really

268
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,690
good to see that they're helping each

269
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,280
other out in exchanging information and

270
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,940
also exchanging for instance and

271
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:53,050
potential speakers and and content yeah

272
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,600
you can move on I think another another

273
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,160
project we started a few music here and

274
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,290
I remember we've received I was actually

275
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,449
talking to Jane at the time but she's

276
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,240
involved in a similar project and from

277
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,480
the ithe Internet Society perspective

278
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,760
it's what we call the ripe ncc community

279
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,910
project fund and it's basically a way to

280
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,580
I mean he take membership money so we're

281
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,430
based on membership fees of all these

282
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,760
over 20,000 members we have and this is

283
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,760
one way of giving back giving back to

284
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,620
the community of those resources that we

285
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,300
that we don't order those fees that we

286
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,440
don't necessarily need to cover the

287
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:36,150
costs so we started this this fund

288
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,240
basically where we give given any budget

289
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:42,240
and our funding like I don't know six to

290
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,550
eight projects depending on their on

291
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,350
what they need so it's not like one

292
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,359
project gets 150 thousand it's like

293
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,400
split between the number of projects and

294
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,680
the application deadline is actually

295
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,850
open right now until the 1st of

296
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,939
September there's a next one committee

297
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,770
that evaluates the applications there's

298
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,160
a link that you can go to the page and

299
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,139
and submit your proposal and there are a

300
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,480
number of criteria basically it has to

301
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,760
be not-for-profit and beneficial for the

302
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,980
community and it tends to be a lot of

303
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,230
open source both software and hardware

304
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:24,440
that we provide and supported in the

305
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:56,900
last few years that came out of that or

306
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:59,450
you know to continue it's in a way very

307
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,550
similar I mean it's free people can

308
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,300
participate the organizing to hackathon

309
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:07,190
see here this year it's the tenth

310
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,810
hackathon we're actually organizing on

311
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,580
Io T and I and security so we don't know

312
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,710
quite yet how is this going to pan out

313
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,139
but we're hoping people will come in

314
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,760
maybe dissect some devices and see how

315
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,210
they can be built better and made better

316
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:30,110
and made more secure over the last few

317
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:32,720
years such as measurements and tools and

318
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,929
DNS and exchange points tools for

319
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,030
exchange points we had the last instance

320
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,870
was interesting was on quantum internet

321
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:44,750
and out of that also came that quantum

322
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:48,290
research group that's now a part of the

323
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,790
I am I RTF and I don't know if the

324
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,879
meeting this week but you probably know

325
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:55,010
that better so this one next one again

326
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,510
it's open for applications you can still

327
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:03,860
register it's an app in conjunction with

328
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:05,330
exploiting and also what's on that slide

329
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,610
that I wanted to mention is we have a

330
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,490
calendar on that page that you can see

331
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,020
at the bottom where other hackathons are

332
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,640
also listed if you're interested and

333
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,680
also in other regions if you want to

334
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,929
participate we've been also helping out

335
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,850
at hackathons in other regions like AP

336
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:28,999
make and lack Nagin so forth

337
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:31,399
yeah another project we started some

338
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:33,679
years ago already is also a maybe that's

339
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:36,289
why I mentioned also he is interesting

340
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,679
on some researches it's the ripe

341
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:41,869
academic cooperation initiative where we

342
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,440
are basically allowing researchers

343
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:47,480
academics to come to write meeting and

344
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,269
present their research and also for this

345
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,139
the deadline of the application is still

346
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:55,369
open till August of is left space and at

347
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:57,379
the moment I think you're looking for

348
00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:00,019
candidates for the arrive meeting in

349
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:04,610
rotterdam and also for a regional

350
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:06,499
meeting in kiev i believe in october so

351
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,479
go to the website have a look I mean

352
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:11,869
it's a really good an opportunity to

353
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,509
present your research and to reach out

354
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:18,918
to operators and to bring like

355
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:22,129
operational research or operators and

356
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,749
researchers closer together and we saw

357
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:25,639
some really great projects to come out

358
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:28,429
of that and also obviously the ideas

359
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:30,080
that those people that those fellows you

360
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,960
know would be then coming back to the

361
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,740
right meetings on their own initiative

362
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,070
or may be funded through other sources

363
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,019
yeah

364
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,629
that's almost it one more slide I think

365
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:46,460
I have just another various other things

366
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:49,330
also at their presenting and moderating

367
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,840
a teaching a lot so if you need anyone

368
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:57,230
talking about any of the topics the ripe

369
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,168
NCC is expertise in or anything I

370
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,029
mentioned let us know and the last but

371
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,649
not least I wanted to mention these ripe

372
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:05,710
Atlas ambassadors that I also I

373
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:08,449
mentioned at the beginning because um

374
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,450
there's also a really good and

375
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,730
successful community project and we we

376
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,899
almost don't have to do anything with

377
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,490
that you know there are notes of these

378
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,428
ambassadors out there handing out these

379
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,789
probes also the our ers the other ARS

380
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:24,769
helped a lot with that and we couldn't

381
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,040
do it without them so and it's a great

382
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:30,290
way to bring out

383
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:34,280
what you think is a useful like

384
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:38,230
measurements and platform I think that

385
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,230
was oh I don't know I don't think I have

386
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:45,169
you are perfectly on time Miriam and the

387
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,418
floor is open for about two minutes for

388
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:49,669
questions for Miriam and Miriam is just

389
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,210
good to see your face thank you thank

390
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:51,919
you

391
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,440
does anyone have any questions for ripe

392
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,870
ncc and if you're not an ambassador for

393
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,360
the Atlas program definitely contact

394
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,309
right because we're seeing the

395
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,469
absolutely important amalgamation of

396
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,700
data that comes out of ripe Atlas for

397
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,620
some of the work that we're trying to do

398
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,340
for more evidence-based research and

399
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:15,110
more information out there in general

400
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:17,629
any questions so go to the microphone

401
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:21,559
sorry I if you have questions you come

402
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,820
to the microphone and ask them and if

403
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,470
you can announce who you are and where

404
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,820
you're from

405
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,179
hi Miriam it's sang by drawing from

406
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,280
Indian society North American Bureau and

407
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,870
I'm glad you mentioned the committee

408
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,190
networks program that that you have I

409
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,620
wasn't following this is a new program

410
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,660
or you had it for a couple of for some

411
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,229
time and if you already had it before

412
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,910
can you share some best practices or

413
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,030
some case studies I think would be very

414
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:50,270
useful for us to take into consideration

415
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:55,970
thank you you are referring to the

416
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:58,429
community project fund right yes yes yes

417
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,660
I believe this is the third year we're

418
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:04,820
doing this and we have you basically a

419
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:11,690
budget set aside at the board approved

420
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:14,270
and the membership approved and evaluate

421
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,330
some applications we have a replication

422
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:21,200
forum where people have to submit the

423
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,668
project lifetime what the results are

424
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,740
this the goals

425
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:28,010
what kind of budget they're looking for

426
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,450
and it's similar to what was they call

427
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,629
it I saw had something similar I

428
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,700
remember but of you so we also learned a

429
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,320
lot from how you and this in the past I

430
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,860
think maybe the chapter projects and I'm

431
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,530
referring to and and so it's a it's it's

432
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,870
you

433
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:46,680
year-long project sometimes and then

434
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,899
depending on the length of the project

435
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,390
you also ask or like a midterm report

436
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,220
and at the end is usually like a report

437
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,850
either at the right meeting or on the

438
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,770
Reb labs blog and and what I've seen and

439
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,419
usually these projects their lyrical

440
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,300
nicely and through the community as well

441
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,340
there's a lot of open source I open BGP

442
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,220
and security projects and came out of

443
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,870
that

444
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,880
thank you very much Mariam and that does

445
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,350
dovetail really nicely with that there

446
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,760
are some other grant projects that we'll

447
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,790
probably get all that information out on

448
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:22,020
the Gaia list well thank you very much

449
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:25,020

cool hi everyone my name is Lonnie Olson

460
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,510
I recently joined measurement lab as the

461
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,669
projects director myself and crystal our

462
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,850
procurement management and Emilia will

463
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,400
be speaking about how we support the

464
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,260
internet search community our contact

465
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,910
information is here as well as the link

466
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,230
to the slides if you like any more

467
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:16,590
information after the presentation slide

468
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:19,440
so what is my mama has made the few

469
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,750
components were supported by teams code

470
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,240
for science and society Google and

471
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,990
instance planetlab Princeton's planet

472
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,650
bug we provide a data repository that is

473
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,090
you know open contributed by users

474
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:36,240
longitudinal and drive for open source

475
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,070
internet infrastructure data and in we

476
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,260
deploy build and run infrastructure that

477
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:45,530
aims in the creation of that data for

478
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,530
posit for you next slide

479
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,860
you know point was simply fishin is too

480
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,860
much of the internet saves data

481
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,530
we like to make because that we don't

482
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:00,270
measure by ourselves people measure the

483
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,700
internet using their their own devices

484
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:04,350
and our servers and we collect it comes

485
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,940
from those measurements and make it

486
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:12,480
publicly accessible so that all this is

487
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,490
done with our principles in mind we take

488
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,350
privacy seriously so all of our data is

489
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,500
synthetic data and our measurements are

490
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:22,889
active meaning only clients initiate

491
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,780
servers do not rest on their own the

492
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,700
experiments are curated and reviewed by

493
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,520
our experts our expert review committee

494
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:33,810
which are and they're mostly developed

495
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,250
by academics and those measurements come

496
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,740
from the community meeting anyone can

497
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,960
develop an edge client anyway again this

498
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,140
new platform friend pressed against the

499
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,460
top one and we believe in open it so

500
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,260
that would mean all of your data is

501
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,580
within some distance to zero and all our

502
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:53,700
code that we're gonna miss for sure

503
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:55,230
there's a choice and this is useful our

504
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,850
community involves a wide variety of

505
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,760
folks it was interested in the internet

506
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:02,669
being measured well and often and we see

507
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,260
academics as a key part of this group

508
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,330
chris is going to talk to that more

509
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:15,629
about how it all works and now and that

510
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:20,760
researcher is super thanks yes and thank

511
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:22,980
you for inviting us to present yeah we

512
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,550
move to go for science we're expanding

513
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,780
and our conversations with communities

514
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,510
like i'ts you have to make sure that

515
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:34,560
researchers and others understand how to

516
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:36,410
use our data and good up into the next

517
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,190
cycle

518
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,050
so a bit about our platform

519
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,350
infrastructure for those who may not

520
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:46,800
already be aware of them lab we place

521
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,840
our servers in transit data transit

522
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
connected data centers so connected to

523
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,470
peering

524
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,300
locations and internet exchanges which

525
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,340
is a different role in a way that other

526
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,080
speed testing and other internet

527
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,199
measurement public internet measurement

528
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,110
platforms place servers so we are not

529
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,360
inside of the last model networks but we

530
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,919
are outside of that too then you have

531
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,000
some information

532
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,580
routes and performance to locations

533
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,330
outside of the last mile the next slide

534
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,889
shows a location where we are around the

535
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:25,350
world the placements of servers where

536
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:29,880
that are running the various tests that

537
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:31,290
we host and so when a user connects to

538
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,130
one of our tests they get routed to the

539
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:38,070
closest geographical Geographic closest

540
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,950
server at the moment and then following

541
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:43,080
into the next couple of slides talking a

542
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,670
bit about the data sets and or the tests

543
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,770
that we're running so tests and

544
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:49,200
experiments we're using synonymously

545
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,090
here and this is a listing from our

546
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,860
website of some of the tests that are

547
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,550
currently or have been in the past

548
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,189
hosted on measurement lab the wide list

549
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,139
the widest used is of course our network

550
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,830
diagnostic tool that was originally from

551
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:08,550
internet2 and then paris traceroute is

552
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:12,480
also used quite heavily by our team in

553
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:15,870
as a matter of course we published all

554
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,900
those data sets in bigquery to the next

555
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:22,879
slide so signing up for our discuss

556
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:26,430
group gives anyone query access for free

557
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,470
and the bigquery web interface in other

558
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:34,410
locations available to query our

559
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,600
bigquery data sets is how most

560
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,010
researchers interact with our data and

561
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,030
on the next slide we have kind of a

562
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:43,379
listing of examples there so when you're

563
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,520
looking at our tables

564
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:51,180
we recently renamed our data sets and

565
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,960
tables to be more end-to-end specific so

566
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:57,720
NDT is an NDT data set and so forth

567
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,930
we also publish all our switch

568
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:04,890
utilization data openly as well so one

569
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:06,660
can examine the throughput of our of

570
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:11,280
each location where that collects data

571
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,080
on to the next slide in terms of

572
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,600
accessing our data there are several

573
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,939
ways to do that we publish our source

574
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,139
data and that's all basically the raw

575
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,600
packet captures and traces the meta

576
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:27,100
that occur each time a test is conducted

577
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,620
to one of our servers the visualization

578
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,850
website which is an aggregation of our

579
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:37,510
NDT data based on location and and by

580
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,399
provider bigquery of course which I just

581
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,470
mentioned that parse data is the primary

582
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,240
way people access our data and then of

583
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,059
course there's a variety of other ways

584
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,350
to access and/or generate data which

585
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,540
we're going to talk about here a moment

586
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:52,240
so we just run through these real quick

587
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,450
next slide the source data is openly

588
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,880
available and it's stored in compressed

589
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:01,600
TGT GZ format in Google Cloud storage

590
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:05,610
it's primarily used by a small number of

591
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:08,290
researchers and partners for exam

592
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:11,080
example someone recently wanted to

593
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,629
calculate actual Vitter according to RFC

594
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,899
of various tests from a certain

595
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:18,820
geography as opposed to what the entity

596
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,000
client gives back to the user which is

597
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,490
an estimate of jitters so to do that

598
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,720
they needed to access and parsha the raw

599
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:31,120
trace files on the second next slide we

600
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,400
published a visualization website which

601
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,570
on our website it's the visualizations

602
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,640
link in the menu that is meant to being

603
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,860
an accessible front door for the general

604
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,340
public to see where they are in the

605
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,820
world and see what our data says about

606
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,879
their locations and ISPs and that's

607
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,168
updated approximately monthly and then

608
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,870
in the next slide

609
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:59,740
the primary way as I mentioned to access

610
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:02,168
our data is in bigquery there's a Quick

611
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:06,190
Start Guide which gets anyone set up

612
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:09,669
with a gmail account to query that data

613
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,070
for free variety of documentation is

614
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:14,559
available and our support addresses here

615
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,470
on this slide this is the primary way we

616
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,340
interact with researchers who want to

617
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:24,309
use our data on to the next slide please

618
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,620
so because it's a research focus group

619
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:30,550
and you're interested in what this data

620
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:32,919
can tell you so we do have a select

621
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:35,080
number of publications these are both

622
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,030
Oh Demick in non-academic listed on our

623
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,330
website and I've just pulled a few of

624
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:43,500
them more recent ones here that are

625
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,939
interest some of which are coming from

626
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,270
researchers and academic units and some

627
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,130
which are not from a variety of fields

628
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,190
as well so we have folks who aren't

629
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:57,180
doing big data analysis but we also have

630
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:03,280
folks who are looking at access and cost

631
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:06,550
the web foundation report there so this

632
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,370
is a primary need for researchers we are

633
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,899
openly available public data set is

634
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:15,090
available for you to use in your

635
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,090
research next slide please

636
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,900
the other way that searchers interact

637
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,420
with measurement lab is to host an

638
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,190
experiment so or a test so any of the

639
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,860
tests that are hosted on our platform

640
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,590
are applied by someone who's designed a

641
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:33,340
network measurement experiments and

642
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:36,610
we're excited that in this calendar year

643
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,850
we will complete our migration from a

644
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:42,270
planet lab based system on our servers

645
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,980
to the docker kubernetes managed

646
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,770
platform and there will be new

647
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,320
opportunities to host new experiments in

648
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,060
different contexts and so if you're a

649
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,139
researcher that's developing Network

650
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:59,970
measurement experiments you can apply to

651
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:02,500
hosts with M lab and I noted that one

652
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,270
that will one new experiment that will

653
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,010
be out of the platform as the whee-hee

654
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:10,750
app which is a net neutrality focused

655
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:13,630
focused test we're excited about that

656
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,370
new platform and in the next few slides

657
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,390
I'm going to talk about how we currently

658
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:22,179
support researchers so there's the

659
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:24,790
general support and documentation so

660
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,429
that's the primary way if you email

661
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,649
support myself or Letty or someone else

662
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,500
on the team we'll get back to you and

663
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:34,810
answer your question we generally this

664
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,210
is light support and how to get you

665
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,739
access to query the data for free or to

666
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,560
answer your questions as you begin to

667
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,969
explore it we've also begun in more

668
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,820
recent

669
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,589
last year so more recently to do

670
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,090
presentations in combination with

671
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:52,420
partners at different research

672
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:54,600
communities so listed here are some that

673
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,100
we've done over the last year or so

674
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,650
which were highly interesting and

675
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:02,110
valuable to make connections with other

676
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,820
folks using data there was some really

677
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:09,010
interesting conversations for example

678
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:14,190
with the the folks at the research ICT

679
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:17,680
Africa group at AFRICOM afrinic and AIS

680
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:22,350
to talk about leveraging multiple types

681
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,910
of datasets for example using picking

682
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,560
using them in combination so we've had

683
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,520
some conversations about how to use rec

684
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,529
data and M lab data together and so

685
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,040
those conversations will continue to

686
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,830
happen we've also started to sponsor on

687
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,640
a small scale some specific research

688
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:44,890
events and to support hackathons like

689
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,160
the sitcom hackathon and booty fest last

690
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,810
year we are going to be sponsoring a

691
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,879
sponsor on the internet measurement

692
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:54,070
conference in Amsterdam coming up soon

693
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,580
and so we're excited about engaging with

694
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:00,940
their research community in those events

695
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:03,160
next slide and Chris just to let you

696
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,700
know you have about three minutes okay

697
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,279
I'll I'll wrap it up

698
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,990
thank you for that time Jack Jane so

699
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,300
another way when you're supporting

700
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,399
research is partnering on a smaller

701
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,910
scale on specific research initiatives

702
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:22,660
so in the u.s. right now your partner on

703
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,190
a research program that's focused on US

704
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,000
public libraries as an anchor

705
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,800
institution to produce a premise-based

706
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,890
device that can run our tests

707
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:39,960
automatically and produce a visualized

708
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:42,160
display of that data next slide and

709
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,960
community-based research is another area

710
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,600
I wanted to highlight separately because

711
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,800
not only are we supporting research on

712
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,110
the academic side but also

713
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,610
community-based data gathering

714
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:55,180
initiatives and visualization

715
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:56,380
initiatives so one reach that one is a

716
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:00,669
app

717
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:02,049
that integrates NDT tested and in the US

718
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,509
the National Association of counties

719
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:07,809
built this app and are using this to

720
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:11,199
gather better leaf geolocation data in

721
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:15,729
order to understand broadband speeds in

722
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:18,429
rural areas next slide then we've

723
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:21,069
participated and ported of community

724
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:23,890
based mapping and surveying initiatives

725
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:25,900
this one some began several years ago

726
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,209
with the city of Seattle Washington and

727
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:31,989
several other rural counties the idea

728
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:35,558
being to place a survey and a web-based

729
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:37,689
NDT test in a website that allows users

730
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,670
to both answer questions about their

731
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:43,598
broadband speeds and to protest to

732
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:45,910
gather that data next slide and so we've

733
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,849
worked with a number of institutions

734
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,949
doing this type of work this slide show

735
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,019
cases the Michigan initiative that is

736
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:56,439
focused on homework gap and giving the

737
00:37:53,019 --> 00:38:01,598
test as an assignment to students next

738
00:37:56,439 --> 00:38:03,788
slide and this there's another

739
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,170
initiative in Louisville Kentucky that

740
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:08,859
started in Louisville Kentucky that is

741
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:11,199
now blossoming into a larger initiative

742
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:14,339
from the technology Association of

743
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:17,880
Oregon that's it's beat up america.com

744
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:21,400
similar but different technology and web

745
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,579
next slide and then finally we just

746
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,459
recently updated participate in a report

747
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:30,369
with Penn State University under the

748
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:31,660
Center for rural PA to examine broadband

749
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:35,799
speeds and compare them with our

750
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:40,239
regulators published speeds from that

751
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:42,489
from from FCC and that has recently

752
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:45,869
launched into the next slide which is a

753
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:48,339
website that New America Foundation

754
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:52,150
recently published that publishes that

755
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:54,009
map online really really interesting

756
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,829
initiative there we're just looking at

757
00:38:54,009 --> 00:39:00,009
the public data sources and finally then

758
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:02,410
coming back to our communities slide

759
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:04,449
that we had earlier this is the real

760
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,449
reason why we want to engage with ITF

761
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:09,760
and ganya and other communities because

762
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:11,830
we see you of course and

763
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,920
as part of the same communities and so

764
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:17,380
we're looking forward to follow-on

765
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,610
initiatives that @m lab that can help

766
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,950
involve more people in Laie did you want

767
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,750
to comment there at the end about

768
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:28,480
anything related to the upcoming things

769
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,100
yeah also we're really trying to move

770
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,080
towards a more community oriented

771
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,480
governance structure and thinking about

772
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:38,500
how we can respond best and provide the

773
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,900
best service for the people that are

774
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,030
using the measurements and the data so

775
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,650
if you'd like to be involved or hear

776
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:48,870
more about that we would really like in

777
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:51,910
your venue and specifically in this room

778
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:53,650
thank you both very much we have about

779
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,230
two minutes for comments does anyone

780
00:39:53,650 --> 00:40:02,170
have any comments in the room if you do

781
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:04,690
just walk up to the microphone okay I

782
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,310
think we thank you very much there's no

783
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:10,180
one approaching the microphone thank you

784
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:12,130
lady and Chris the slides are on the web

785
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,810
so if anybody wants to double-check and

786
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,580
reach out to the EM labs community

787
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,320
please do and thank you for what you're

788
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,120
doing we know that the community is

789
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,580
appreciative of a lot of the research

790
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,380
and looking at the broadband Maps we

791
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,240
always makes me smile because the next

792
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,740
presentation from our colleague Matt ran

793
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,750
Tannen who's with the tribal communities

794
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:32,169
will show us where there are some very

795
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:34,030
big gaps in connectivity and the certain

796
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,040
parts of the world so thank you very

797
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:47,440
much and Matt's up will pull it will

798
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:49,830
pull up your slides thank you yep if you

799
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,830
need it

800
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:15,100
just cap it off and the clicker okay so

801
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,629
welcome Matthew Ann Tannen I currently

802
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,970
hold the position of Director of

803
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,670
Technology for twenty Native American

804
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:23,589
tribes in Southern California and I've

805
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:27,490
been working with them I'm starting my

806
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:29,050
19th year with them I also run

807
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:33,129
partnering in business development for

808
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:35,110
arcadian infra comm which is a fiber

809
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,570
builder in the United States it's about

810
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:40,390
18 months old it's been in the public

811
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,130
since January I'll explain a little bit

812
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,180
more about that and then you can see a

813
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,850
few of the other things that I've been

814
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:49,000
involved with currently involved with

815
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:52,420
him involved with back in the past so

816
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,370
we'll just jump into it since we have 10

817
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:59,110
minutes or so so I want to talk about

818
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,509
what the previous administration used to

819
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,620
call technology deserts

820
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,370
you know everybody coins their phrase

821
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:08,529
about the unconnected groups of people

822
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,600
in the United States but this is

823
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,730
relevant to where I'm at in the

824
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,650
southwest and where the fiber company is

825
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,540
building in the southwest so it was a

826
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,120
slide that we use and it's actually on

827
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,220
the website of Arcadians website so it

828
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,020
shows you know clearly a infrastructure

829
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,660
going to an area with not a lot of

830
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:28,270
people but it is a way to connect to

831
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,660
people and I just want to I'll move

832
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:32,950
along until we get into actually I'm

833
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,350
gonna go forward and then come backwards

834
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:39,759
again so we have land that looks like

835
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:41,740
this in the tribal regions now you

836
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,690
remember the you know there's also in

837
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:49,930
Canada 634 First Nations in in the US

838
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:54,100
there's 573 federally recognized tribes

839
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:56,529
and these tribes were moved to areas

840
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,779
where the general population didn't want

841
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,370
to live right so they pushed people into

842
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,290
the base of the mountains they pushed

843
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:05,170
people away from the beach away from the

844
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,240
lakes away from where they normally were

845
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,650
inhabitation and and they were pushed to

846
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,740
these regions that didn't have services

847
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,910
and didn't have opportunity so it was a

848
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,589
responsibility of the federal

849
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,029
governments to be able to connect those

850
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,980
people and bring the resources to them

851
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,530
because they put them there and that's

852
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,120
not obviously happening so the tribes

853
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,220
themselves have been working to solve

854
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,880
this problem but some of the geography

855
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,950
looks like this and then aerial you know

856
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,170
you're looking down in valleys that are

857
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:37,660
not visible from other locations except

858
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:39,580
for mountaintops and yeah and and so

859
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,089
this is the kind of solution that makes

860
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:47,529
a lot of sense in in tribal communities

861
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:49,660
I would say one size does not fit all

862
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,270
every reservation every tribal reserve

863
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,859
is different some of them are on the

864
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:56,740
flattest land you can imagine looks like

865
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:00,340
somebody ironed it some some of them are

866
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:03,549
on the the most rock rocky jagged you

867
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:06,520
know geography that's available and so

868
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,110
digging fiber in a lot of situations is

869
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,780
not permissible

870
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:13,270
just because geography digging fiber is

871
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,550
typically not permissible because when

872
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,710
we varied people and had cultural

873
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,050
ceremonies and things and recorded that

874
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:22,210
that was taken away and and those

875
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,670
records were destroyed so a lot of the

876
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,680
where somebody is buried is not recorded

877
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,420
and so when you dig you typically run

878
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,450
into artifacts and different things that

879
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,120
are tough to deal with so you don't want

880
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:36,370
to to dig on tribal land unless you

881
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,089
really have a good knowledge of what's

882
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:44,290
going on so a lot of the things because

883
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:45,790
we are in remote locations and we are

884
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,440
away from where the services are

885
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,170
delivered we have to provide our own

886
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,280
services as well so solar solar power is

887
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:56,410
a big power source wind power and

888
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:00,970
generator power a big power source to

889
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:01,960
survive and provide us connectivity at

890
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:06,040
the locations where we need to

891
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,870
distribute our network and yes it snows

892
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,970
in San Diego I like putting that one up

893
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:11,589
there because San Diego its beaches so

894
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:14,350
we have locations that are very

895
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,030
beautiful and very remote we see the

896
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:18,880
below there a homestead on one of the

897
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,859
reservations and and how far away

898
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,109
is from other existing infrastructure

899
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:27,220
and wireless is the way to communicate

900
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:28,630
with those folks there's some more tower

901
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,480
locations that have been built over the

902
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:33,039
years really small repeaters to be able

903
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,250
to reach out further and further into

904
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,690
community and then I'll get to a map

905
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,400
there we go now I can start talking

906
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:41,619
about some of the core problems that

907
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,920
have happened so in the United States 20

908
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:46,839
years ago ish about seven networks were

909
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,839
built across east to west west to east

910
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:53,140
whatever you want to do and they were

911
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:54,578
valued on miles built fiber miles built

912
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,078
right that was the value of the company

913
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:59,349
that's where they got their money they

914
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,750
got their loans their evaluation so to

915
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:04,660
go across the country as fast as you

916
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:06,730
could building fiber you avoided things

917
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,970
like the Grand Canyon or the Rocky

918
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,200
Mountains or you know a giant lake you

919
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,759
didn't go through those things because

920
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,009
they slowed you down or you had to go

921
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:17,230
around them to make to make it easier to

922
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:20,619
build fiber miles you also avoided

923
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,029
Native American reservations I'm sure

924
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:25,180
it's the same in Canada but this is the

925
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:27,789
US map and you see along these paths

926
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:30,009
this is the fiber paths that exist in

927
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:32,710
the United States this was done out of I

928
00:46:30,009 --> 00:46:35,589
think Oregon State University the map

929
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:37,779
overlays and I worked with the Obama

930
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:40,779
administration with a CTO of the United

931
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:44,950
States to define this very map with the

932
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:46,569
carrier's data actual KMZ files laid

933
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,910
over top of tribal of reservation

934
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:51,730
boundaries to determine how many missing

935
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:55,180
middle mile fiber miles there were there

936
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:58,569
are 8,000 miles of missing middle mile

937
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:01,240
fiber to to just connect the lower 48

938
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:03,369
tribes and that's 320 reservations so

939
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,279
8,000 miles are missing just to get

940
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:09,039
middle mile fiber to 320 reservations in

941
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:11,829
the lower 48 alaska is a whole nother

942
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,630
problem so you see the big red circles

943
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,700
those are what they're calling in the

944
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,009
connectivity deserts those big red

945
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:21,009
circles are full of tribes they're also

946
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:22,839
full of sparsely populated rural America

947
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:24,849
small town USA people that have been

948
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,950
left behind there is no service in these

949
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:30,870
areas a lot of times no cellular service

950
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:33,149
so what do you do

951
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,890
solve that you can build a community

952
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,150
Network from the ground up which we've

953
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,549
done at the tribal digital village

954
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:40,410
network in Southern California but then

955
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,790
our biggest problem was in the last six

956
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,670
years to try to figure out how to get

957
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:46,110
transport to the rest of the world at an

958
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,080
affordable cost because we didn't have

959
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:50,610
access to fiber we were paying $99 per

960
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,490
megabit per month u.s. dollars

961
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:57,660
so obviously you can't scale that and

962
00:47:53,490 --> 00:48:00,209
survive so for the last six years we've

963
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,940
been navigating the policy the state

964
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,680
government of California the different

965
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,510
providers in the region and solving this

966
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,399
problem there is another way to look at

967
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,160
this problem and and to solve it as well

968
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,440
and that is one of the things that I am

969
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,470
involved with the Arcadian infra comm

970
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,360
company so the other way to do it is to

971
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,509
take the people who are driving the path

972
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,450
of the Internet and who is that right is

973
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:28,290
that 18 t Verizon any of the telcos no

974
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:31,259
it's no longer the carriers it is the

975
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:32,900
over-the-top hyper scalar data companies

976
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,060
right it's Google Amazon Microsoft

977
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:38,070
Facebook and Apple those five are

978
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,040
driving where fiber needs to be put

979
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:43,290
based on placement of data center they

980
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,150
set a data center down they need three

981
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:47,520
minimum three diverse routes out of that

982
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:50,940
data center to be you know within their

983
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,040
network plan they're looking for four so

984
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,650
if you look at the black lines on the

985
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,480
map those have been built rebuilt and

986
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,310
rebuilt and people are still building on

987
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,080
them and there's no diversity to those

988
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,830
routes you know the fiber gets cut in

989
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,810
that location

990
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:06,270
that's all laying in the same ditch if a

991
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,740
backhoe rips open an entire ditch and

992
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,920
cuts all the fiber that whole regions

993
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:13,529
down if you look at the United States

994
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,640
Denver and El Paso if you chop out fiber

995
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,440
and Denver and El Paso

996
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,839
East does not talk to west until you get

997
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,970
it fixed right there are no real routes

998
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,030
that go back and forth across the US so

999
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,259
it's time to draw new lines on the map

1000
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,530
how are we gonna do that we're gonna do

1001
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,900
that with those five companies money to

1002
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,370
connect their new data centers because

1003
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,400
they need another diverse route out of

1004
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:40,140
their data center path but with the

1005
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,800
ability and the and the morality to drag

1006
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,990
that line

1007
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,670
that new line on the map through all of

1008
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,740
the small towns in the United States

1009
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,900
through all of the Indian reservations

1010
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,910
in the United States to be able to drop

1011
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:56,070
open opportunity at each of those

1012
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:57,819
locations at every intersection library

1013
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,260
post office

1014
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,300
you name it will will provide

1015
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,330
opportunity along those routes

1016
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,820
for our partners and others to come in

1017
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:08,710
and build those those community networks

1018
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,690
or Muni networks that need to happen to

1019
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,430
support the small town USA and the small

1020
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,680
reservations that are spread out across

1021
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,950
the country this particular route

1022
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,819
happens to have 320 miles on the Navajo

1023
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:23,290
Indian Reservation

1024
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:25,660
so that is supporting them with strands

1025
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:27,940
of dark fiber lit services 400 years of

1026
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,910
lit services on the reservation as well

1027
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,680
as a revenue share and that is the new

1028
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,080
model of how to work with a Native

1029
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,419
American tribe as a partner rather than

1030
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,759
and then as an obstacle when you're

1031
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,780
moving across the United States and

1032
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,730
Canada

1033
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,940
so then let me flip back up to you I'm

1034
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:54,250
gonna go backwards for a second and that

1035
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:57,190
one okay cool so I just wanted a few

1036
00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:00,100
minutes to wrap up I just wanted to talk

1037
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,930
about the lack of opportunities in the

1038
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,100
u.s. the changing environment that you

1039
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,330
know working with different

1040
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,990
administrations and things like that

1041
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:11,020
really fast you've seen the landscape

1042
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:12,970
you've seen the fiber map the the data

1043
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,470
that comes out of the reports from the

1044
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,020
Federal Communications Commission is

1045
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:19,629
skewed because it's based on marketing

1046
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,730
maps that are provided by carriers right

1047
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:25,630
carriers provide what they're proposed

1048
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:27,820
to cover and what they cover if I have a

1049
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:30,070
giant area and I have one house

1050
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:33,130
connected in that area that entire area

1051
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:35,530
gets counted in that report so it's

1052
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:38,560
false and it doesn't have the true data

1053
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,930
so that true data we're trying to work

1054
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,820
with the general Accountability Office

1055
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,680
to define what that true data looks like

1056
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,810
we're trying to get the FCC to change

1057
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:50,589
their data recording methods everyone is

1058
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:52,120
to get the reality of that to be able to

1059
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:55,300
define better what it looks like on

1060
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,970
tribal reservations Indian communities

1061
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,250
American communities do not participate

1062
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:02,529
typically in surveys they don't

1063
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,000
typically want to be counted every time

1064
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:06,370
they've been counted in the past they've

1065
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,260
been eliminated so every time how many

1066
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,000
are you you're a hundred okay we're

1067
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,830
gonna kill 50 of you right because that

1068
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,330
you're too many so it you know what

1069
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,770
there's a there's a stigma there there's

1070
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,270
a history there that they don't like to

1071
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,310
participate in every time they get

1072
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,080
counted something bad happens so it

1073
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:22,360
needs to be an understanding of you know

1074
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,710
you're being misrepresented you know we

1075
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,880
need to collect the information so that

1076
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:28,540
we can understand how to better

1077
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,100
represent you in this fiber plan and and

1078
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,680
build out plans so there are there are

1079
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,370
some obstacles to education and

1080
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:39,430
awareness to be overcome that we

1081
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:42,299
understand that that Wireless is a great

1082
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:45,850
opportunity as a stopgap or as a

1083
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:48,250
half-measure to get to fiber and it may

1084
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:50,680
be a complete and total solution if the

1085
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,030
fiber is impossible but we are striving

1086
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,980
to get fiber to each of these

1087
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:56,260
communities at least into the community

1088
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,450
to be able to have bigger transport and

1089
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,940
be able to support more throughput to

1090
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:04,330
the end-user at what we call the first

1091
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,820
mile not the last mile the first mile is

1092
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:13,210
the one that counts and that's pretty

1093
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:14,380
much it if anybody has any questions and

1094
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:17,440
we have been trying to promote the idea

1095
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:19,030
that the communities are the first well

1096
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,190
not the last mile because with that sort

1097
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,960
of mindset people are thinking to go

1098
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:26,260
over to the core or the hardest to reach

1099
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,620
last which is not one right question

1100
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:31,000
this is Dino Elizabeth I met us you over

1101
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,790
to top vendors that are trying to bring

1102
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,860
fiber through you mentioned that they

1103
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:38,470
may have to connect libraries in public

1104
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,060
places and stuff is are they resistant

1105
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:43,060
to that or are they just bringing one

1106
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,040
fiber strand down it's responsibility of

1107
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,230
the individuals that's happened to it or

1108
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,759
do they not allow it so they're not even

1109
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,830
actually involved in that component of

1110
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,570
it so when the build happens from data

1111
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:55,299
center to data center they're just

1112
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:57,340
giving getting delivery from each end in

1113
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,410
the middle we're dragging the line the

1114
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,780
company's dragging the line into the

1115
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:04,480
region and then offering up connectivity

1116
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,130
at that location and and then we're not

1117
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,600
building out the community side we're

1118
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,330
partnering with folks that would do that

1119
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,540
build out

1120
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,980
and they do layer one all the way up to

1121
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:19,520
building putting switches and routers

1122
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:22,130
and stuff there there demarked like so

1123
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:28,880
like Google or Facebook's responsibility

1124
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:31,010
or ours okay okay so so the the over the

1125
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,350
top players are just concerned about

1126
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:37,220
traffic from A to B and that transport

1127
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:40,850
long haul and we will be managing loops

1128
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:43,370
and small accessibility you know huts

1129
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,020
and handholds along the way of the route

1130
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:47,540
to be able to support those communities

1131
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:50,660
and be able to give either lit services

1132
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:52,910
or strands of fiber to a third party

1133
00:54:50,660 --> 00:55:01,750
that will be building that component out

1134
00:54:52,910 --> 00:55:01,750
and managing that Friday morning I leave

1135
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:09,070
[Music]

1136
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,080
verses Leandro Makati

1137
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:14,630
University of Venice that correct also

1138
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:19,180
with the project on the European

1139
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:19,180
Commission called the Commons project

1140
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:46,370
that was interesting okay okay just

1141
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:50,420
fullscreen it cool okay so thank you for

1142
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:52,670
having me here I'm not though I am

1143
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,260
professor at the university of Venice up

1144
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,420
to May I was a researcher at the

1145
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,800
University of Trento in Italy and I was

1146
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,480
the work package technical coordinator

1147
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:03,440
or a project that is called net Commons

1148
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,760
he ended in 2019 in March and we light

1149
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,880
it at the University of Trento with

1150
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,440
other partners like UPC and I'm also a

1151
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,420
member of the New York Stock or

1152
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,270
Community Network in Florence on one of

1153
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,640
these guys that you know climb of roofs

1154
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:18,470
and try to make wireless links from one

1155
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:23,029
building to another

1156
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:24,709
and just a bit about the project because

1157
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:26,300
I think it's it could be of high

1158
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,540
interest for a lot of people that are

1159
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:32,000
here we were researching on community

1160
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,400
networks under several points of view

1161
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,410
and the social side under the computer

1162
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,210
engineering side under the legal side

1163
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,810
and there are a lot of results that I

1164
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:43,940
suggested to check out because we worked

1165
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:46,640
a lot and we published a lot about

1166
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:49,220
technology but also about governance low

1167
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,129
and we were able to influence the low

1168
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:54,649
stream in Europe to help community

1169
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,810
network to grow so what I'm going to

1170
00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:00,020
talk about it's this student named it

1171
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:02,180
tool and which I really have to find a

1172
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:05,660
name for it but first we have to make it

1173
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,700
work probably and the point is that we

1174
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:10,460
were trying to make something that has a

1175
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,868
double nature so for communities so for

1176
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,720
people like me that go on top of the

1177
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:17,180
roofs we wanted to give a methodology to

1178
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,189
be able to actually check out if your

1179
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,109
link if your wireless link is possible

1180
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:23,540
or not and have a rough estimation of

1181
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:25,640
what it is and then as a research tool

1182
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,920
we were our goal was trying to

1183
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,810
understand how much a wireless mesh

1184
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,630
network with point to point or point to

1185
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:35,089
multi-point links can scale and generate

1186
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:36,829
topologies to study how much what what

1187
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:39,710
kind of topology we can actually achieve

1188
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:41,960
and and possibly in the future where

1189
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:46,220
this network may actually evolve in a

1190
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:48,530
specific city what we are the components

1191
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:51,290
that we use open the open data surface

1192
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:53,119
models path loss models and an engine

1193
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,490
that simulates the growth of the network

1194
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,640
so let's let me just go through the

1195
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:01,220
three points so yeah that just just a

1196
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,490
little warning we did this the code is

1197
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:08,149
already on github it's a bit done in a

1198
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:09,649
rush for at that time you know but see

1199
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,240
we're working on it and there are a lot

1200
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:13,550
of things that we can actually improve

1201
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,910
but we are happy to I'm really happy to

1202
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:19,880
receive any kind of feedback so we

1203
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:23,240
started from data sets taken from lidar

1204
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:26,300
surveys which are basically it's a

1205
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,700
larger technology that is used to to map

1206
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,890
the surface of places and a lot of

1207
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,270
public administration give you away this

1208
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,549
data for free and you can

1209
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,500
actually have a view of the 3d view of

1210
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:39,230
the city including the buildings and

1211
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,240
then we actually mixed it with data from

1212
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:45,050
OpenStreetMap or any other like this is

1213
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,189
an Italian public public organization

1214
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,230
that give you the shapes of the

1215
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,180
buildings which in some cases especially

1216
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:53,030
in rural areas it's better detail in

1217
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:56,390
OpenStreetMap and given this two things

1218
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,860
we can actually say if between a couple

1219
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,470
of buildings there is line of sight and

1220
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,300
then we do some heuristic and to

1221
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:05,089
understand if the Fresnel zone is

1222
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:08,660
partially obstructed and with this we

1223
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:12,010
kind of estimate the path loss that you

1224
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:14,450
can have between those two buildings and

1225
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,400
once you have this this is just an

1226
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,290
example this is Florence it's a city in

1227
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,850
Italy we're starting with data from

1228
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:21,410
Italy because you know we know the

1229
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:24,710
language you know how to interpret other

1230
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:27,080
things and yeah and this is the pink is

1231
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:30,140
ground level white it's buildings and

1232
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,660
this is a hill that is just in front of

1233
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:34,490
my house and specifically and and this

1234
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:38,359
is the same thing from another 3d point

1235
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:40,609
of view so those the mountains here

1236
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,820
they're there the buildings the the

1237
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:48,410
thing on top over there it says the the

1238
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:50,900
hill and and then we just over which is

1239
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:53,839
imposed on top of those hills the

1240
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:57,590
buildings and then we are able to

1241
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:00,080
understand modeling if they feel like

1242
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,550
it's possible and what well there is not

1243
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,080
this more or less this kind of stuff

1244
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:08,690
this is just an example of a link that

1245
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,880
can be done this was on this was in

1246
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:13,460
Indian because Leon has a very nice in

1247
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,040
France as a very nice data set with a

1248
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:19,970
lot of precision and basically this is

1249
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:22,940
the same link that we were testing using

1250
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:25,640
different kind of datasets the first one

1251
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,440
is the most precise one the second one

1252
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:32,660
is the down sample and the third one is

1253
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:35,060
it's a pretty famous produced database

1254
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:37,850
that is caused SRTM that you can get it

1255
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:40,310
for free from the nasa it's for over the

1256
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:42,440
world but it's precision it's really

1257
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:45,520
different from what we need in urban

1258
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:50,420
areas and so

1259
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:52,820
we extended this using the data sheets

1260
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,220
from ubiquity devices ubiquity it's a

1261
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:58,190
banner for wireless stuff right well as

1262
01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:00,649
gears so we collected data from a few of

1263
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:02,360
those gears and so given a path loss we

1264
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:05,510
can actually try to understand what

1265
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,220
would be the bitrate that those two

1266
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:09,860
specific devices could actually

1267
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:12,259
negotiate and since we know the price of

1268
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,570
these devices we can also estimate what

1269
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:18,860
is the best couple of devices to make

1270
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:20,810
that specific link and this is something

1271
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:23,150
that we are still working on so it's

1272
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,890
just a very simple web interface where

1273
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:29,300
basically you actually pick two points

1274
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:31,790
in space you choose how long out all

1275
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,740
your poll where you can mount your

1276
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:36,080
devices would be and you pick the

1277
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,520
devices and this is going to tell you if

1278
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,970
there is an off site and it's going to

1279
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,470
give you a rough estimation of the bit

1280
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:44,149
rate that's gonna be negotiated

1281
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:46,730
depending on a lot of heuristics that

1282
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:50,900
I'm not going to then I'm not going to

1283
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:53,720
go through here so now we have a way to

1284
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,700
estimate if a link is possible and we

1285
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,439
were discussing at the bottom mesh in

1286
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,450
Paris with with other communities other

1287
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,340
wireless communities how the way that

1288
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,540
they could use it and there were other

1289
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,210
communities that were doing similar

1290
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:07,660
stuff is in different data so this we

1291
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:11,510
had quite a good reception from them and

1292
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:15,020
but then we try under research point of

1293
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:18,830
view we try to make some to use it to

1294
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,660
estimate our growth as such data could

1295
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:23,810
grow in pairs environment your bass

1296
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:26,509
human liberal jew-run and so basically

1297
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:28,790
what we do is we decide the location of

1298
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:31,040
our Gateway like in a city and then we

1299
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:32,600
pick a random sequence of buildings in

1300
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,580
the area and every time we try to

1301
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:38,500
connect those buildings to those that

1302
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:42,200
are already in the network and for each

1303
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:44,510
every time that we add a new node we try

1304
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,700
to estimate what is the guaranteed

1305
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,920
bandwidth that this new node will have

1306
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:51,379
towards the Gateway or the other way

1307
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,700
around actually and again there are a

1308
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,950
lot of heuristics here then I'm not

1309
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:57,439
going through but okay this is more or

1310
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:58,580
less it's a model then we can improve

1311
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,320
budget some other

1312
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:02,210
so in the end what we can do is to have

1313
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,740
this network that grows picking notes at

1314
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:06,850
random and telling us what is the

1315
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:09,350
bandwidth at every node could get and

1316
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:12,049
and then we have to decide when this

1317
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:15,710
growth will stop one way to estimate

1318
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:19,100
this is that we actually fix a certain

1319
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:20,840
minimum bandwidth per node and we

1320
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:23,299
actually measure what is the percentage

1321
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,730
of nodes that actually achieve this

1322
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,490
minimum bandwidth and then we stop when

1323
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:31,820
there is no way to add new nodes without

1324
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:34,250
making all the network without breaking

1325
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,920
the stop condition which is 95% of nodes

1326
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:39,560
will have at least a specific bandwidth

1327
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,060
that we decide and this again lot of

1328
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,890
parameters but is something that we can

1329
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:47,900
actually work on and so what is the the

1330
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:50,060
one of the goals of this regis for

1331
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:52,250
instance when you do mesh network you

1332
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,110
cannot plan your network not to pop up

1333
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:58,010
new people want to join and they just

1334
01:03:54,110 --> 01:04:01,100
join in in the what the houses so what

1335
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:03,170
you can do you can actually give them

1336
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:05,210
suggestions on how to shape the network

1337
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:08,030
quality is growing so for instance one

1338
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:10,460
thing that we want to know if if there

1339
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:12,680
are only decisions that we can actually

1340
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:14,600
try to enforce to make the network more

1341
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,240
scalable for instance you add in a new

1342
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,220
node which means that this node will

1343
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:21,290
potentially connect to several other

1344
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:24,529
existing nodes which is the note that

1345
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:26,390
you're going to choose and the normal

1346
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:28,280
decision that the Dumbo's decision that

1347
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:30,379
we have always taken as community

1348
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,970
networkers is you just pick the one that

1349
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:35,000
is giving you the best bandwidth on that

1350
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:36,980
link which is it's just the most natural

1351
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,870
thing that you do actually we will

1352
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:40,940
imagine if we can do something better

1353
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:44,270
than that for instance since we have a

1354
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:47,090
metric that is going to determine when

1355
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:49,580
the growth will stop well you can

1356
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:53,450
actually you could actually pick the

1357
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:55,520
neighbor that is actually producing the

1358
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:57,290
metric that is bad that is bad for the

1359
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,990
nephew so the one that the neighbor that

1360
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:02,270
will actually give you the best metric

1361
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:03,890
in your network evolution and this is

1362
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,540
just one of the things that that we can

1363
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:07,310
do okay I have this number some numbers

1364
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:09,980
here but I don't want to go much into

1365
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:11,890
the details what I want to show you here

1366
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:14,529
is that you have a minimum diff

1367
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:16,240
minimum bandwidth per user and this is

1368
01:05:14,529 --> 01:05:18,269
the number of users that you can achieve

1369
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,180
number of nodes that you can achieve

1370
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:24,970
with respecting that stopping condition

1371
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,399
in values Yubin environment these are

1372
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:29,368
all topologies that we generated using

1373
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:32,680
data data from the tuscany region

1374
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:37,660
because yet we know it and and this with

1375
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:39,460
a greedy approach so you get between 150

1376
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,519
and 200 nodes for the minimum bandwidth

1377
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:46,000
for one megabit per second and if you

1378
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:48,970
use the network approach you can more

1379
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,010
than double it basically so if you tell

1380
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:52,569
if you give the instrument to the

1381
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:54,400
community and they have to make this

1382
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:57,339
decision you can actually help them to

1383
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,609
make the network scalable or well scale

1384
01:05:57,339 --> 01:06:04,630
better and yet that's more or less

1385
01:06:00,609 --> 01:06:05,980
everything so we did this tool to model

1386
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,390
the growth of the network and the

1387
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:09,670
methodology can actually replicate it

1388
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:11,288
using data from any place and we are

1389
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:13,109
giving away the code and we are also

1390
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:15,640
trying to understand if you can include

1391
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:18,220
datasets from other countries so the

1392
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:21,098
people on just use our servers which are

1393
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:23,859
not actually know public now but they're

1394
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:25,750
gonna be and yeah and then we'd have a

1395
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:30,160
lot of ideas to keep developing this

1396
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:33,519
tool in several directions just a few

1397
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,038
thing is one thing now we're picking

1398
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:37,750
nodes at random it would be Lin really

1399
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,970
nice if we could actually pick notes

1400
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,920
with some other criteria so we could

1401
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:43,779
take data from national surveys and

1402
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,490
understand who is living in that

1403
01:06:43,779 --> 01:06:46,930
building more or less because data's are

1404
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,750
pretty detailed and so you can

1405
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:51,538
understand what in average e you have

1406
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:54,279
people with this education this age and

1407
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:56,500
so they might be more likely to want

1408
01:06:54,279 --> 01:06:58,569
this link and if you get this kind of

1409
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:01,240
data then you can actually try to

1410
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:03,880
understand where your network cables not

1411
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,189
just a random topology but in that

1412
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,289
specific city where it is it going to go

1413
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,240
so which area in that city are going to

1414
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:14,589
be served or are not going to be served

1415
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:17,950
and that's it credits code by myself

1416
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:20,049
Gabriela Jamie bad code by myself a good

1417
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,700
code by gabriela and daniela made the

1418
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:24,220
interface and then you find a lot of

1419
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,540
details in in this paper which has was

1420
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,399
actually accepted

1421
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:30,730
ago so you found it on the network

1422
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,280
shortener and I'm gonna put for sure a

1423
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:38,010
version online on my web page and this

1424
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,010
is also together with and that's it

1425
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:55,180
where do I get them from public

1426
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,680
administrations like in in Tuscany there

1427
01:07:55,180 --> 01:08:00,669
is there's a website that gives you the

1428
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:05,080
delighted map in in France I think that

1429
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:07,270
each part of the nation is covered by

1430
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:09,730
other map and you can get them and some

1431
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:13,390
of them are also even integrated in

1432
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:15,370
OpenStreetMap in some places so but this

1433
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:17,229
for instance in the guys from New York

1434
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:20,290
they have the whole not the ladder map

1435
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:23,910
they have the whole 3d model of the

1436
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:26,859
whole city so they do something similar

1437
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:28,540
guys who are deploying mesh networks on

1438
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:30,970
the top of rooftops in Brooklyn and

1439
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:34,390
other places and they were a battle mesh

1440
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:35,799
so they've got a github site we can put

1441
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,690
you in touch with them because they're

1442
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:42,490
super keen to work with other community

1443
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:47,710
networks as well any other questions one

1444
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:51,250
more i Joseph ugh that economists

1445
01:08:47,710 --> 01:09:04,049
foundation any pushback from other

1446
01:08:51,250 --> 01:09:04,049
suppliers is on for everyone

1447
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:09,608
are you giving any pushback from any

1448
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:11,559
incumbent suppliers like even if they're

1449
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:14,319
not servicing certain areas are

1450
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:16,750
incumbents seeing potential competition

1451
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:19,839
and getting in the way either directly

1452
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:22,540
or through through various

1453
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:24,729
jurisdictional administrations so you

1454
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:26,260
ask anything in general oh what's the

1455
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:33,870
relationship between like community

1456
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:38,230
networks and telcos and companies are

1457
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:39,028
having quite a problem with companies

1458
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:44,139
that won't name

1459
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:46,150
but and the jurisdiction

1460
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,859
administration's tend to have their

1461
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:50,410
closer alliances with certain big

1462
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:53,250
companies so I'm wondering if you're

1463
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:56,230
experiencing the same sort of thing in

1464
01:09:53,250 --> 01:10:00,070
well that's that's a good question and I

1465
01:09:56,230 --> 01:10:01,690
mean I can ask you I can see you on the

1466
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,309
basis of the project that we did while

1467
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:06,160
we were talking with many different

1468
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:07,930
communities and it depends a lot on the

1469
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,330
place for instance in Italy it's

1470
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:13,780
actually illegal right now to do

1471
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:16,360
trunking on five gears so Niyaz I'm

1472
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:18,219
bandwidth which should already killed

1473
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,250
the whole thing itself something that we

1474
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:24,070
discovered six months ago

1475
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:26,739
in other places there is like small

1476
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:29,980
operators actually behave well with

1477
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:32,230
community networks in other situations

1478
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:34,480
come in big operators do not go to the

1479
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:36,730
place as long as the community doesn't

1480
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,849
show that there is a market and then

1481
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:41,830
they come there and but it's it really

1482
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:50,350
depends on the specific situation so I

1483
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:54,489
cannot generalize probably getting

1484
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:56,680
through Friday great so Chris you're at

1485
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:57,070
and to the gentleman that just asked the

1486
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,720
question

1487
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:01,960
some of us have targets on our backs

1488
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,550
because of this there is a lot of

1489
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,250
pushback around the world for the small

1490
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:08,440
networks which is really it's really

1491
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:11,350
strange to us because there are small

1492
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:13,660
community networks servicing communities

1493
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,800
of 5,000 and under generally where the

1494
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,420
return on investment for the bigger

1495
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,980
companies isn't met

1496
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:20,170
so we don't quite understand why the

1497
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:22,000
model isn't accepted so it's a

1498
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:24,100
conversation we could have perhaps

1499
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,070
outside the room so that we can make

1500
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:29,230
sure Curtis gets up there but it's a

1501
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:31,450
it's a complicated conversation just to

1502
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:33,580
put it diplomatically I guess yeah I

1503
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:36,309
just saw you having a because anyone

1504
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:38,470
outside here on that it's an issue that

1505
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:41,680
affects not just as to domain but lots

1506
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:44,320
of domains itself cool thank you so

1507
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,780
Curtis introduce yourself yeah hi

1508
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,559
everybody I'm Curtis Amaral assistant

1509
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,719
professor at the University of

1510
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,190
Washington the purpose of this talk is a

1511
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:52,300
little bit of grenade throwing in a

1512
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:54,400
light light very high

1513
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,840
be supportive way so this is a really

1514
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,129
early-stage project that we're just

1515
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,280
spinning up in Seattle and what I'd like

1516
01:11:57,130 --> 01:12:01,869
to do is be told it's a bad idea if it's

1517
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,099
a bad idea and hopefully it's a good

1518
01:12:01,869 --> 01:12:04,650
idea and maybe that's what we'll get out

1519
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:09,159
of this

1520
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:10,659
so yes hello I'm Curtis I'm part of the

1521
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:12,190
ICT D lab at the University of

1522
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:14,230
Washington this is a long-running

1523
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:16,449
research lab focused on the intersection

1524
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,159
between technology and poverty professor

1525
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:19,928
Richard Anderson is the other co-lead of

1526
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,940
the lab he runs financial services and

1527
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:24,909
health services and I do universal

1528
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:27,549
internet access and conservation so my

1529
01:12:24,909 --> 01:12:28,929
lab for quite a while now has been

1530
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:30,070
working on community networking and we

1531
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:31,750
were already talking about this on a

1532
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:34,239
brief introduction just in case some

1533
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:36,070
people didn't haven't been following us

1534
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,839
for a while these are networks built

1535
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:39,549
owned and operated by the citizens and

1536
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,369
users in a participatory and open manner

1537
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:44,230
we fee being the juggernaut in the space

1538
01:12:42,369 --> 01:12:46,960
at thirty five thousand nodes just this

1539
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:48,250
amazing effort in Catalonia but there's

1540
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,829
many many of these networks now for

1541
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:52,030
iPhone kalter mundi NYC mesh all these

1542
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:53,440
sort of networks spinning up throughout

1543
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:56,139
the world and all built on these eight

1544
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,089
or to 11 mesh protocols which we're all

1545
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:59,050
hearing a little bit about there and

1546
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,159
this is there's a whole bunch of reasons

1547
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:02,050
for this unless you operate an

1548
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,659
unlicensed spectrum largely we're at the

1549
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:06,369
IETF we understand IP networks these are

1550
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:09,219
IP networks and so we're able to use

1551
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:10,598
these in sort of an intuitive way my

1552
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:12,489
group in particular has been working on

1553
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:15,030
a subset of community networks known as

1554
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:16,839
community cellular networks these are

1555
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:19,480
community networks utilizing the

1556
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:22,270
cellular protocols that other than the

1557
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,949
Wi-Fi protocols we build off of some

1558
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:26,110
open implementations of the cellular

1559
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:28,808
standards open BTS and Osmo com4 the 2g

1560
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:31,239
stuff open air interface SRS LTE for the

1561
01:13:28,809 --> 01:13:33,159
LTE stuff there's a couple examples of

1562
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:35,259
these networks many many less than the

1563
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:36,670
you know 211 networks rhizomatic of

1564
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,579
being a juggernaut in this space then

1565
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:42,670
Oaxaca our own networks in the

1566
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:44,380
Philippines and Indonesia similarly my

1567
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:45,190
group has recently not that recently

1568
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:47,880
probably the last couple years

1569
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:49,839
transitioned over to focusing on LTE

1570
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,849
specifically a project called community

1571
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,520
LTE or coltie which Spencer right there

1572
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:57,159
runs and so we've been deploying that

1573
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,630
into our communities recently there's a

1574
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:00,489
network up in Oaxaca I have a student

1575
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,780
there right now as well as a network up

1576
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:03,759
in Indonesia and hopefully we'll be

1577
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:05,960
scaling from there these networks have

1578
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,150
largely focused on sort of traditional

1579
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,980
rural access problem stuff like what

1580
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:11,900
Matt was talking about just saying hey

1581
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,309
there areas without connectivity so

1582
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,900
there is a good fit for that right and

1583
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:16,370
then we come up with a normal rural

1584
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,559
access problems hey you don't have

1585
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:21,050
backhaul let's do local services all

1586
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,550
these kind of things but our group has

1587
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:23,870
sort of been iterating a little bit and

1588
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:25,969
we started asking ourselves the

1589
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:28,160
following question is community cellular

1590
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:29,930
appropriate for cities as well right so

1591
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,400
you look at our work on community so

1592
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,469
it's all rural but you look at mesh

1593
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,179
networks things like NYC mesh you don't

1594
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:37,640
get a lot less rural than New York City

1595
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:39,140
and so we were trying to see if maybe

1596
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,790
this technology could be applicable in

1597
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:42,200
that domain as well and so I'll go

1598
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:45,010
through a little thought experiment on

1599
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:49,219
Wi-Fi networks versus cellular networks

1600
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:51,440
so the biggest Wi-Fi network I can find

1601
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:55,370
in the world is a thing called fawn has

1602
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:59,000
anyone in the room used Fon zero ok

1603
01:14:55,370 --> 01:15:00,590
white one it's it's reported this twenty

1604
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,239
three million hot spots throughout

1605
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,350
primarily Europe which is probably why

1606
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:07,070
it's a little bit of an unfair question

1607
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:08,480
to ask here distributed around and the

1608
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:11,150
idea is basically similar to your

1609
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:13,070
Xfinity Wi-Fi at home right so the way

1610
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:15,559
Fon works is they put their software

1611
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:17,179
onto a router you run the router and by

1612
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,130
being a Fon customer you can roam on to

1613
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:21,800
other Fon routers in your town right and

1614
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:23,480
so this is I think the largest Wi-Fi

1615
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,469
network on earth this is what Fon

1616
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:30,620
coverage looks like in downtown London

1617
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:32,180
so 23 million hotspots but you can kind

1618
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:35,260
of see some of the limitations of trying

1619
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:37,489
to build city scale Wi-Fi networks right

1620
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:40,340
and so there's a whole bunch of these

1621
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:42,019
first Wi-Fi is just bad at city scale

1622
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:44,330
you can see all these little dots are

1623
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,130
little dots and that's the nature of

1624
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:47,570
Wi-Fi right Wi-Fi has been selected to

1625
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:50,600
operate in these bands that have low

1626
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,700
propagation and so it doesn't go very

1627
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,110
far

1628
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,519
Wi-Fi is really bad at mobility it was

1629
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,989
just never designed into the protocol

1630
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,700
mobility being the ability to move

1631
01:15:56,989 --> 01:15:59,989
between different access points so

1632
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,010
you'll lose your connection and you lose

1633
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:02,690
everything as you go along this is

1634
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:04,880
solved by some of the centralized Wi-Fi

1635
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:07,070
stuff but you don't see that that

1636
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,290
commonly and again the limited coverage

1637
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:10,489
area makes it just hard right you're

1638
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:12,440
gonna run into dead start pretty fast

1639
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:15,049
leaving your house even if handover

1640
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,429
worked and lastly Wi-Fi is bad at

1641
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,960
Spectrum coordination we see this with

1642
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:19,340
the mesh network work if the network is

1643
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,900
really really dense

1644
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,580
communication happens if the network is

1645
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,530
really really sparse or you lose

1646
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:26,090
connectivity between the hops so it's

1647
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:29,119
really hard to build these kind of city

1648
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:30,500
scale Wi-Fi solutions and now we'll give

1649
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:32,389
an example of a city sale Skelly a

1650
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:35,119
cellular solution this is British

1651
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:37,310
Telecom this is British telecoms map of

1652
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:40,489
London the green areas are areas with

1653
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:40,909
good coverage it's all of them it's the

1654
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:43,968
river

1655
01:16:40,909 --> 01:16:45,679
it's everything right and so why is this

1656
01:16:43,969 --> 01:16:47,179
easier well there's a lot of business

1657
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,320
reasons which I'm at the IETF so I'm

1658
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:50,360
going to punt on those it's actually a

1659
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,830
little unfair to punt on those because

1660
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,420
that's a whole side discussion but we're

1661
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:56,630
community networking people so we can

1662
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:58,219
punt on this in the short term similar

1663
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:59,869
is really good at white area right it's

1664
01:16:58,219 --> 01:17:00,949
designed for this it's kilometres of

1665
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:03,348
coverage and that's what it was built

1666
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:05,449
for in the start so there's great of

1667
01:17:03,349 --> 01:17:07,580
mobility it's a level 2 element of

1668
01:17:05,449 --> 01:17:09,559
cellular it's like a core requirement

1669
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:12,139
the 2g standard was built specifically

1670
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,820
to allow people to move on trains in

1671
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:16,210
France like that was in the

1672
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:18,380
specification to be able to do that

1673
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:21,530
LTE actually includes peer-to-peer

1674
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:23,360
mobility primitives in the protocol so

1675
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:25,070
the Eno B's the access points talk

1676
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,989
directly to each other to do mobility

1677
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:28,250
and lastly it's good at spectrum

1678
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:30,409
coordination this is literally what

1679
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:31,940
cellular means so there is spectrum

1680
01:17:30,409 --> 01:17:33,409
coordination it's how to coordinate

1681
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,969
spectrum inside of a city so we don't

1682
01:17:33,409 --> 01:17:36,290
waste any of it and then there's all

1683
01:17:34,969 --> 01:17:38,000
these technologies as its said on top of

1684
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:40,159
that songs self-organizing networks

1685
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,469
being the sort of standard to be able to

1686
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:46,580
coordinate spectrum so white cellular

1687
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:48,110
networks are good for city scale

1688
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,239
coverage okay this shouldn't have been

1689
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:52,190
too much of an army with anymore why

1690
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:54,230
what's stopping us community networking

1691
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:55,699
people from building this stuff well

1692
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:58,489
there's sort of standard set of answers

1693
01:17:55,699 --> 01:18:00,259
to this problem spectrum right so Lola

1694
01:17:58,489 --> 01:18:02,629
loses license spectrum and spicen

1695
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,800
spectrum is brutally difficult well it

1696
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:06,800
turns out that's been shifting it

1697
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,300
specific quite a bit recently first with

1698
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,800
the cvrs band this is a citizen's

1699
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:15,440
broadband radio system band 48 LTE that

1700
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,290
is a neat tri-level licensing regime

1701
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,030
that has frequency open for small users

1702
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:21,560
you don't forget a telecom to get that

1703
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:23,659
in fact there are always bands available

1704
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,699
everywhere for non telecom users so

1705
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:26,989
that's great and moreover the cellular

1706
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:29,030
people are creeping in on our business

1707
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:31,129
and so now that there is actual cellular

1708
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:33,199
protocols to run in Wi-Fi bands

1709
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:35,330
this is LTE you and LTE LA

1710
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,830
those are designed to coordinate with

1711
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:38,900
the existing Wi-Fi installations to

1712
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:40,910
allow LTE to op right there so cellular

1713
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,429
spectrum is getting a lot easier and has

1714
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:44,420
in the last five years

1715
01:18:42,429 --> 01:18:47,840
okay cellular hardware is super

1716
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:49,550
expensive right well not since LT e 2g

1717
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,900
access points were like tens of

1718
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:53,150
thousands of dollars ten years ago

1719
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:55,820
there's been a big drive to commoditize

1720
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:58,370
those and so now 2g access points or 5k

1721
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:01,790
an LTE node B that you can run that we

1722
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:04,309
run in Papua is $2,500 a new radio 5g is

1723
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,960
pushing that even farther so they built

1724
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:08,239
a commodification about a kind of

1725
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,770
commoditization model into there that's

1726
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:13,129
making us all much more affordable as we

1727
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:15,350
go forward as we mentioned telecoms are

1728
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:17,179
kind of difficult to work with and so

1729
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:20,090
well what are we gonna do we need

1730
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:23,420
telecoms right no LTE is IP based

1731
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:25,489
entirely it's just a big Wi-Fi network

1732
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:27,050
and so do what you do in your Wi-Fi

1733
01:19:25,489 --> 01:19:28,759
network run things over the top run

1734
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:32,000
what's up and you're running a wide area

1735
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:34,280
network without the telecoms necessarily

1736
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,350
being able to get into your way you

1737
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,790
don't need phone numbers and lastly

1738
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,110
cellular equipment is really hard to use

1739
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:40,910
and this is actually I think the most

1740
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:43,610
exciting one and sort of brought me into

1741
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:45,500
this room to talk about this is that you

1742
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,849
know LTE isn't designed for the little

1743
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,860
guys right yeah everyone in here can run

1744
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:51,710
a Wi-Fi hotspot but you can't do that

1745
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:54,349
with LT necessarily this is shifting

1746
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:56,600
right now one data point is the Wireless

1747
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:58,610
ISP model in the u.s. there are hundreds

1748
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,400
of wireless ISPs in rural America

1749
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:04,910
running LTE equipment they do that they

1750
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:06,559
hand you the radio receiver and it has a

1751
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:08,090
sim card built in and you just have

1752
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,340
access in the wide area so this is

1753
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:12,230
already happening so sort of hacker ish

1754
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:14,570
folks are running these networks at

1755
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:16,459
scale in the US a second thing that's

1756
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:19,610
happening is private LTE and this is all

1757
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:21,140
IOT buzz but it's actually getting built

1758
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:22,849
so these are let's say you own a factory

1759
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:24,739
and you want to do do IOT in your

1760
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:26,270
factory well what you can do is install

1761
01:20:24,739 --> 01:20:27,949
a small cell phone network just in your

1762
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:29,660
building against smaller and smaller

1763
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:32,000
organizations participating in building

1764
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,500
out this kind of networks lastly carrier

1765
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,260
aggregation is I think the most exciting

1766
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,510
thing this is going to be a huge element

1767
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,610
of the middle term future and into new

1768
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:43,699
radio what it is is in buildings like

1769
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:45,139
this the owner can install LTE in the

1770
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:46,320
building and what they'll do is they'll

1771
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,050
loan that out

1772
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,340
to the carriers the VMO knows and charge

1773
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,230
a little bit of overhead on that so

1774
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:55,140
basically every office building every

1775
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:58,370
residential metropolis building is going

1776
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:00,720
to have building owned network in it and

1777
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:02,250
for that to be a community network is

1778
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,630
not significantly different than what it

1779
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:07,260
is now you just pointed at a different

1780
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:08,490
carrier aggregator okay so this is kind

1781
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,080
of the point I think this is a great

1782
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:14,700
opportunity right now just start to

1783
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:16,950
build out community LTE in cities so I

1784
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:18,450
went too fast so what's the plan what

1785
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:19,800
are we doing what is it what is what are

1786
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,269
my students actually building it's it's

1787
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,710
largely this right so our technology

1788
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:26,640
agenda is the thing we're calling

1789
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:28,110
federated LTE and the big idea is we're

1790
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,450
using distributed ledger as the backend

1791
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:33,389
to store a whole bunch of the core

1792
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:35,760
network required people know amber we've

1793
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:37,530
sort of hedged our bets on doing amber

1794
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,000
esque stuff by thinking LTE is the

1795
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,370
better access medium for all the reasons

1796
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,960
I've given earlier the big idea here is

1797
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,490
make it so that anybody can join this

1798
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,080
Federation let you stand up a new LTE

1799
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:47,969
network you pointed at the right thing

1800
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,830
you join the Federation all the sim

1801
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:51,780
cards work all the roaming works all

1802
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:54,420
that kind of stuff and instead of just

1803
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:55,950
doing the billing as the Federated

1804
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,540
element which is what amber did before

1805
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:59,400
we're gonna try to do everything else

1806
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:01,800
you saw authentication and mobility and

1807
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,019
spectrum coordination similarly in the

1808
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,820
sky in a way that everybody can peer

1809
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:09,630
together in a distributed decentralized

1810
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:10,889
fashion so this isn't a hugely technical

1811
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:13,530
talk so I'm gonna hand away of all of

1812
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:15,450
that but we are building things and

1813
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,920
we're deploying things and so this is

1814
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:19,800
our planned deployment here in the fall

1815
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,360
in Seattle so we have access to two

1816
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,730
rooftops from the University of

1817
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:26,790
Washington one is Harborview Medical and

1818
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:28,110
the other one is 45 45 in in the U

1819
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:31,050
district and so that's the northern one

1820
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:32,429
here and this other one here we're gonna

1821
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,820
put two networks up have them fed right

1822
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:37,440
together and build a small-scale

1823
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:39,349
federated LTE network in Seattle I think

1824
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:43,019
it'll be the first community cellular

1825
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:45,240
installation in a city that I know of a

1826
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:46,800
key point here and kind of one of the

1827
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,269
reasons to be here is that as a nature

1828
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,650
of a federated network anyone here is

1829
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:50,880
welcome to join and we'd be happy to

1830
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:52,589
point you on how to do this kind of

1831
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,320
stuff you stand it up and we'll send you

1832
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:56,640
some SIM cards and you can roam onto our

1833
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,030
network and we can roam on to yours and

1834
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:02,270
hopefully everybody's friendly and happy

1835
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:05,590
all right thanks excellent any questions

1836
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,590
for Curtis we have about two minutes

1837
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:20,740
this is Geoffrey Gaston hi yes the yes

1838
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:32,690
or no fee yeah so the way that it works

1839
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:34,790
technically is that your radio will

1840
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:35,750
connect to whatever the core network is

1841
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,920
somewhere right and that's the

1842
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,170
organization you're talking about that

1843
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:41,060
has some sort of privacy guarantees and

1844
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,740
so even in the roaming network in like

1845
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:43,790
you're a carrier aggregation side of a

1846
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:45,620
building if you're an AT&T customer

1847
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:47,570
they'll build a pipe for you to go to

1848
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:49,610
AT&T and then your your data is all

1849
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:52,040
sensibly private at least the AT&T now

1850
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:54,380
in our system we're actually removing a

1851
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,850
whole bunch of this for a bunch of

1852
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,690
technical reasons users are saying we

1853
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:58,400
should be doing with the internet

1854
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:00,620
doesn't do end and privacy on basically

1855
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,660
everything it's only handling IP traffic

1856
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,550
if you're sending me unencrypted things

1857
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:07,010
over that it's not going to help you or

1858
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:25,280
it's not gonna it's not gonna be a good

1859
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:26,600
idea but yeah sure so traditionally

1860
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,889
backhaul limitations have been a huge

1861
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,540
deal in rural access specifically

1862
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:31,340
royalty our network and Bob who has a

1863
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:33,019
three megabit per second backhaul our

1864
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:34,220
front-hall connection on that thing like

1865
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,630
that for knows the wrong word but the

1866
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:37,670
connection to the user isn't like a

1867
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:39,320
hundred megabits and so it's just the

1868
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:40,610
mismatch there's a huge deal the nice

1869
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,049
thing about what we're doing here is the

1870
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:43,070
City of Seattle in particular has fiber

1871
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:44,450
all over the place so we're just

1872
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:45,110
plugging into that we're gonna be good

1873
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:46,820
to go

1874
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:49,370
so in general the answer is like

1875
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:51,860
approximately 100 megabits slightly more

1876
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:53,210
than that but it depends on the use an

1877
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,580
individual handset I think can handle

1878
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:56,660
like 20 megabits per second normally and

1879
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,920
then you're gonna spread out your

1880
01:24:56,660 --> 01:25:00,849
hundred megabits over whatever but so

1881
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:03,020
that's probably about the right answer

1882
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:05,330
these are great questions I don't know

1883
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:06,380
off the top of my head yeah it depends

1884
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:07,550
on what our open source partners

1885
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:10,660
currently support which almost certainly

1886
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:10,660
means ipv4 only

1887
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:16,030
this is Dino list in the private LT

1888
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:17,860
building case yeah

1889
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:22,090
is that at the point where you use it

1890
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:26,620
instead of Wi-Fi or in addition to its

1891
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:28,570
it's mostly so in addition is the sort

1892
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,980
of reality facing version of it right so

1893
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,620
if you have an apartment building people

1894
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:34,719
are going to put in their own their own

1895
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:36,010
their own Wi-Fi but what they want to do

1896
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,240
is have like people coming into the

1897
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:38,740
building have to sell over the whole way

1898
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,240
through and in this whole business

1899
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:43,059
pipeline to be able to get that money

1900
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,710
out of AT&T and into the the the

1901
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,110
building owners and I think in the

1902
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:48,460
future this is a longer discussion I

1903
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,780
think there's like a big battle to be

1904
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,100
had of exactly the question you're

1905
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,290
asking because why would you run both of

1906
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,940
these at the same time and I think the

1907
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:56,470
reality is that LTE has a lot of really

1908
01:25:54,940 --> 01:26:01,809
nice properties but at the moment it's

1909
01:25:56,470 --> 01:26:05,770
going to be both for a while about

1910
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:08,380
roaming between public Ltd Private Ltd

1911
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:10,180
and Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi six and all these

1912
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:15,940
different radio technologies that are

1913
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:17,350
going to exist at the same time yeah the

1914
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:19,030
aminos have thought a lot about this

1915
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:20,770
they have a solution set for this and

1916
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:29,080
the idea is that if everything is a and

1917
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:30,010
G it works yeah yeah there's a we should

1918
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,990
talk about it offline because I have a

1919
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:33,400
whole bunch of like fun Finn sim hacky

1920
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:34,570
solutions to solve some of these things

1921
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,910
at the end of the day hopefully what

1922
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:37,990
it'll be the Federation is another

1923
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:39,190
element of the Emma nodes you can

1924
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:41,530
connect you so if you have a federated

1925
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:43,059
sim you're able to you know roam on to

1926
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:58,540
that network and participate in the same

1927
01:26:43,060 --> 01:27:00,640
way but yeah hopefully zero yeah those

1928
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:04,269
days we don't speak of anymore in

1929
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:06,460
general so but yes we're hoping you see

1930
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:09,810
BRS in in Seattle like that's the the

1931
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,810
story and we're sticking to it

1932
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:25,870
so this so the band 48c BRS band is

1933
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:27,309
currently has a set of nationwide

1934
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,420
licenses that have been doled out so we

1935
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:31,030
have a partner who's gonna let us use

1936
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:35,200
that in april that's gonna roll over to

1937
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:38,500
the actual SAS the spectrum not auction

1938
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,000
system maybe an allocation system which

1939
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,070
does sort of an automated system of

1940
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,480
grabbing spectrum in which case we're

1941
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:45,219
going to be deploying a thing that lets

1942
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:46,990
us do that so that we grab the spectrum

1943
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,460
as it goes there's like nice technical

1944
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:50,139
stuff for CBR s at the moment and

1945
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,760
largely the discussions have been about

1946
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,230
rural areas but the fact is there will

1947
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,130
be spectrum available in cities and so

1948
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:56,129
that's what we're trying to leverage

1949
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:11,080
okay thanks I'm here till Friday morning

1950
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:13,420
to close because he has some ideas on

1951
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,300
what our next steps are and process we'd

1952
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:20,170
like to initiate

1953
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:23,440
yeah my presentation is kated for the

1954
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:26,170
next time it was related to the the the

1955
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:28,089
challenge of of revising via there is an

1956
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:31,860
IRF see that was produced by this group

1957
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:35,920
very 2016 it's it's called alternative

1958
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:37,540
networks something like that and then

1959
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,390
there was a discussion about the

1960
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:43,420
technologies at that time kinetic models

1961
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:46,000
of network providers and definitely

1962
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:48,940
things have changed significantly in the

1963
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,010
last few years so just say that if

1964
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:53,169
you're interested to contribute if you

1965
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:56,740
have some ideas about things that could

1966
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:58,480
be updated extended or whatever just

1967
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:00,820
come to me or send me a message and that

1968
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,889
we would try to organize a plan for

1969
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,139
therefore in the next meeting about how

1970
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:08,950
to upgrade the document how to keep it

1971
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:11,260
up to date and what I think it's now one

1972
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:14,519
we need to the three so I think it's

1973
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:17,590
much harder for everyone like those who

1974
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:23,230
came and they interesting ideas those

1975
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:25,660
who have some things to discuss after

1976
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:28,480
the meeting and well I hope you enjoyed

1977
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:31,599
I hope the information is useful for the

1978
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:35,139
m-40 percenters if you go to the to the

1979
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:37,030
back to the path you can also correct or

1980
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,780
extend your description of your

1981
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:42,960
presentation

1982
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:42,960
and then Google published a week or two

1983
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:47,350
