[Music]

3
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,739
[Music]

4
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:56,349
I never get stupid Santa topic she wakes

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:04,268
everyone if you're not expected a stew

7
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,699
be here you're in the wrong room and we

8
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:19,930
would like to someone volunteer for a

9
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:32,400
minute taker okay good we got one thank

10
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:32,400

11
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:49,070
okay right good and then Marco is gonna

12
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:52,700
take the relay okay okay so your

13
00:04:49,070 --> 00:05:01,480
neighbor is gonna do the relay so let's

14
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:07,010
start I'm gonna take the mic so please

15
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:35,930
we denote Wells we have to show the

16
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:37,550
slide well so this session is under not

17
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,960
well is there anyone that is not aware

18
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,930
of the knot well if you're not you could

19
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,760
search that on your favorite search

20
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,590
engine document status updates

21
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,890
well document that have been updated are

22
00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:01,570
going to be presented today and anything

23
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:05,510
you want to add so basically since we

24
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,280
met last time we all of the documents

25
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,510
that we had been working on have now

26
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,599
gone to the area director and if the

27
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:18,440
earlier director was here which he seems

28
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,870
to have not decided not to show up the

29
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,780
first thing I do is be saying so ban

30
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:28,850
winner we actually get 80 reviews on

31
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:43,090
these documents which he's gonna say

32
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:45,620
well he started on the first one a

33
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:50,450
priority has been indicated to him which

34
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:58,070
is of the proof of possession biessed

35
00:06:50,450 --> 00:07:00,229
and then for olaf documents we really

36
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:07,790
have to get this privileged thing

37
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:09,590
through yes and he has yes he in the

38
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:14,230
data tracker he has actually moved that

39
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,229
into i'm trying to review it state

40
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,650
hi everybody

41
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,939
today I am presenting the key

42
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,400
provisioning for group communication

43
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:51,819
using ace this is a working group

44
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:56,080
document version 2 so a quick recap for

45
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:58,389
if you haven't seen this before these

46
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,840
documents specify how to use the ACE

47
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:06,909
framework and profiles to provide

48
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,049
authentication authorization and an key

49
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:13,000
distribution to notes joining a group so

50
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,819
the first part of the exchange here is a

51
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,759
message flow from from the document the

52
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:23,430
first part the client is I know that

53
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:27,520
wants to join the group contacts the a s

54
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:31,240
through the ACE or the ACE exchange with

55
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,519
the AES and the KDC posterization token

56
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,329
to the KDC KD c stands for key

57
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,519
distribution center and then afterward

58
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:42,338
contacts the KDC to get the keys

59
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:47,589
so this through a distribution request

60
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:51,279
and response after that it has the keys

61
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:54,010
in place to protect the communication

62
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,230
with the other group members through a

63
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,390
dispatcher this dispatcher can be for

64
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:04,660
example broker if we talking pub/sub or

65
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:08,380
it could be just a multicast so first of

66
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,949
all status update of version 2 and i'm

67
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,930
gonna go through the sub date quickly

68
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:15,699
but we would like some feedback from the

69
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,760
working group all these updates come

70
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:20,740
from review by jim so we have

71
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,990
implemented these changes based on his

72
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,640
review and he has signed off on those

73
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:29,589
updates but yeah so the first one we are

74
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,180
the procedures for updating and renewing

75
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,839
key materials that were previously

76
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,180
missing we add the type to the key

77
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,339
distribution request so this type

78
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,770
indicates if the key distribution is a

79
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:44,020
join request so when the job when the

80
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,699
node first joins the group it's a leave

81
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,220
request if it's

82
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,930
you know this telling the dispersion

83
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,660
center that it's actually leaving the

84
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,579
group and it causes rekeying for the

85
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,640
current group members there is the

86
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:01,870
update type for the key distribution

87
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,530
which is the node requests the most the

88
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,710
most updated or current key material

89
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:12,780
than new if the the node wants to

90
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:16,420
retrieve new key material for itself and

91
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,430
then pop keys if he wants to request one

92
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,939
or more public keys of current group

93
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,430
members so these were already there just

94
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:36,490
we added this type that makes it simpler

95
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:40,920
to see what request is custom consider

96
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,990
before you watch here we consider what

97
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,990
[Music]

98
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:53,439
can you expand this is a set of verbs

99
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:56,530
you have a Chinese object new and of

100
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,980
course in rest we usually do this over

101
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:03,280
resources so we create resources delete

102
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:12,040
resources observe resources to get

103
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:15,490
updates we haven't considered that if

104
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:19,420
you have suggestions on what terms are

105
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:22,120
back there but this is for this is for a

106
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,520
new field in the request that is called

107
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,240
type and the site will take some values

108
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,420
and we define here what the values mean

109
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:35,110
so yeah we can we can discuss this is an

110
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,660
example requesting gave the returned

111
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:42,520
most updated King which of you do I know

112
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:46,719
this once a second or we try to move

113
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,490
this as an observe if possible that's

114
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,440
easy to do if it's already a rest

115
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,440
interface yeah

116
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,740
no Francesca Robin Wilton I'm just a

117
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,739
really quick question when when in

118
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,440
operations such as in this case leave

119
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,100
causes this KDC to rekey for the current

120
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,980
group members is there a may should or

121
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:22,870
must tell the group members that that

122
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:25,750
rekeying is happening so it's a must

123
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,240
so the KDS mission center master key and

124
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,740
we don't this document doesn't specify

125
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,120
exactly how this ricky happens

126
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,850
yeah maybe Marco wants to say something

127
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,540
well I don't think that was quite the

128
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:44,070
question okay so it was my fault and my

129
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,810
point is if the Kate if the KDC must

130
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,660
update the keys for it for a group all

131
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,619
the members of that group told that

132
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,620
Ricky is happening

133
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:59,890
it depends what is the reckoning like

134
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,080
what is used for Akeem it could be an

135
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,780
observer or it could be just the unicast

136
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,940
or multicast depending what is setup

137
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:11,640
this draft stays general so it doesn't

138
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,640
define exactly so yeah

139
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,880
Marco from Ray is just to complement and

140
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,490
this is left to the application the very

141
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,740
final decision depending on if you

142
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,450
really care about preserving for

143
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,630
security in case of living notes if you

144
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,360
do you must do that definitely it does

145
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:36,760
depend on the oricon scheme and how it's

146
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:41,260
done as well so other updates we have

147
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:44,560
added additional fields for negotiating

148
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,930
the format of the public key to use so

149
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,229
this is done in the 201 response to

150
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,880
token post in the ACE exchange we added

151
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,800
approval to session signature of the

152
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,870
nonce from the client to the KP

153
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,209
distribution center in the key

154
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,110
distribution request because we are also

155
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:04,989
sending this public key

156
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,360
we added requirements on profiles of

157
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,350
these documents such as multicast and

158
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,709
sub so this is an appendix saying what

159
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,829
the profiles of this document has to

160
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:23,609
implement we define the application

161
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:25,750
profile so here we we need these details

162
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,690
additionally to this document to be able

163
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,500
to implement this and this is different

164
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:35,200
from the ACE profiles that we call

165
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,360
transport profiles that are using the

166
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,910
first phase of of the exchange then we

167
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,910
define the default for the format of

168
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,360
parameters and some Yano registration

169
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:58,120
with labels and expanding on security

170
00:14:49,360 --> 00:15:01,120
considerations so following the some

171
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,519
reviews of version o 2 we have a couple

172
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,110
of open points we would like to discuss

173
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,670
today the first one is about scope so

174
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,709
right now scope is defined in this

175
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,269
document is the finest civil array of

176
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:18,399
two elements group ID in for example

177
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:23,800
multicast or a topic for pops up and

178
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:26,019
then one or an array of roles so you can

179
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,719
see in the example in our case we have

180
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:34,089
array topic 1 and then array of

181
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,220
publishes subscriber MQTT define

182
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:40,060
something similar in a different format

183
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:44,170
so it allows for multiple scopes and

184
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:47,229
multiple roles and we got the question

185
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,810
from Jim that was sure we allow multiple

186
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,980
scopes in the same access token ask for

187
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:57,518
example MQTT does and to answer this

188
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,220
question we have to look at the actual

189
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,390
application profiles for example if you

190
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,600
are talking about multicast and

191
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,279
multicast using oscar group comm then no

192
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,010
because there is a one-to-one mapping

193
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,880
between the scope and the security group

194
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,439
if we talk about pub/sub then yes he can

195
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,660
make sense because you may want to use

196
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,899
the same security material for different

197
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,779
topics

198
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:28,990
so if we do want to do this what does

199
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:31,149
this mean our proposal is to allow

200
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,689
multiple scopes which can be useful in

201
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:37,720
certain use cases for example not not in

202
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:41,740
not in multicast and ausco are used but

203
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,350
for possum that means that we would add

204
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,209
an array for the first element of the

205
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,209
scope so we would allow several topics

206
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:56,920
also Jim note is that there is no need

207
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,748
for sending the request right now the

208
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,279
case is key distribution request was

209
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:07,000
sent to your I associated to the topic

210
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:10,959
so since the topic is contained in the

211
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,419
access token that is not needed or sorry

212
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,209
in the in the institutional requests

213
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:17,850
that is not needed and instead this key

214
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,620
distribution request can be sent to a

215
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,750
fixed group URI rather than one

216
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,698
associated with the scope and the scope

217
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,309
can be made mandatory in the key

218
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,200
distribution requests so for example in

219
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,658
here in the in the figure you would see

220
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,169
that this this key distribution request

221
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,909
is sent to this path group key and then

222
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,250
under the group key there is a resource

223
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:40,390
handler that is going to redirect

224
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,760
because you should request to the right

225
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:48,970
topic depending on the scope contained

226
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:52,090
in the message so if I think we

227
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,240
discussed this with Jim he seemed to be

228
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,720
okay with this if anybody sees a problem

229
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,720
with this

230
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:11,379
beautiful stroke just in technical

231
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,210
detail to avoid confusion by not defined

232
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,520
the scope in the two documents one for

233
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,870
the group and the other food for the pop

234
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,870
shipment because if you do it in one

235
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,209
document I'm sure some people say why

236
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,449
don't define though why not define the

237
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,730
scope in the two documents for the group

238
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:32,550
membership and the other for the perks

239
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,550
up and leave it open in this in this

240
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:39,850
there are some things that need need to

241
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,910
be specific to the tude of documents for

242
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,889
example the values of roles here for

243
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,000
pops up would be publisher will be a

244
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,370
texturing with publisher and subscriber

245
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,870
but it can be the same in both there is

246
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,370
really no reason to have it different

247
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,979
like the format of the scope can be the

248
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,560
same do you see a reason not to have it

249
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:09,280
I think it would be easier actually to

250
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:13,270
have the same format so just

251
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,670
clarification do you want to a to the

252
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:20,820
scope a to a different place is the same

253
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:23,290
format or do you keep one place no it's

254
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,439
really fine the only format there is

255
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,000
about scope document yeah I understand

256
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,460
that you defined in this document that

257
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,190
it is an array of two elements like the

258
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,650
second element can be so many elements

259
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,020
didn't understand but in the defer the

260
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,430
factual documents that you can use it

261
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:44,170
for topic you can have several of these

262
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,180
cookie how did you manage the topic very

263
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,730
conservatively that the format looks

264
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,380
that is differently used then in for the

265
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,020
group management I think that should be

266
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,860
separate done in the documents

267
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:58,810
animations it gets confusing meaning

268
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:06,100
okay maybe you should take this offline

269
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:09,700
so you can but I I take it that you

270
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:14,820
think it's confusing but you don't think

271
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,820
it's it's gonna create a problem

272
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:28,320
okay well let's let's continue some more

273
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,360
open points so right now the the

274
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,030
document specified it's see signs and

275
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,800
ons nan Swan that is generated by the

276
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:40,740
KDC for pop and pub key and Jim

277
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,710
suggested that we add second nonce nonce

278
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,800
to that is signed together we don't Swan

279
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:50,160
and sent to the KDC distribution

280
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,720
requests it seems like good good

281
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,840
proposal so we would go ahead and

282
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,840
implement that unless they're comments

283
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,660
I'm not the open point and we would like

284
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:07,590
the opinion of the earth experts here is

285
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:10,080
about registering new parameters because

286
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,500
right now we have two new parameters

287
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,500
that we are that we are using in the

288
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,310
token post post and in the response to

289
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,520
the token post and right now we're which

290
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:26,070
is during in D ace AS creation hints

291
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,430
registry which is we were told the wrong

292
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:31,700
place to do it and Jim suggested that we

293
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:34,770
registered them in the post parameters

294
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:40,320
registry and then we rd both parameters

295
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:45,720
seaboard mappings Mike Jones Microsoft I

296
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,850
agree with Jim okay sounds good also I'm

297
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,550
not I don't know if anyone is monitoring

298
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:54,330
jabber but I assume that load we can

299
00:21:50,550 --> 00:22:01,500
just go in the mythical queue if he

300
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:05,310
wants to comment as well great so we'll

301
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,380
go ahead and do that yet we might have

302
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:10,490
more questions for the OAuth people

303
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,410
because we don't know if you need to

304
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,010
specify more details at us these our

305
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:22,620
parameters specific two days and this

306
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:26,450
document but final question another

307
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,129
comment from Jim was the format of keys

308
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,600
could be the same as the

309
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,550
using the CNF field so we would do this

310
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:42,419
modification doesn't change much it's

311
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:45,720
just an update to do then we have a

312
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:50,280
couple more points that are about

313
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:53,160
rekeying so what the document says about

314
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,620
Ricky is that so this goes back to the

315
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,320
discussion we're having before about

316
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,000
updating etc Ricky so the KDC should

317
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,860
renew the king material upon group

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,120
membership change and should provided to

319
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,879
the current group members through

320
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,889
drinking scheme use in the group so

321
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,720
right now we define how the si can get a

322
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,790
new king material and we say

323
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,350
alternatively the redistribution King

324
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:18,360
material can be initiated by the KDC

325
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,820
otherwise the default mechanism will be

326
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,080
the client sends a request to the KDC

327
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,810
asking for a new king material when if

328
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,629
if the redistribution key material is

329
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,000
initiated by the KDC we don't know what

330
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,520
end point should the KDC use to send

331
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,440
Ricky messages and we don't know if this

332
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,470
is in scope of this document but we

333
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,480
think it should be and our proposal to

334
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,490
solve this is to define a new optional

335
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,820
parameter called reeking URI or

336
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,740
something else if you have that idea in

337
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,629
the key distribution requests and the

338
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,110
client used this parameter to tell the

339
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,920
KDC

340
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:58,199
what you are I introduced for sending

341
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,890
unicast request messages back to the

342
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,480
client so in this in this case the

343
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,880
client would take the role of the server

344
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,360
and is telling the KDC that would take

345
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:14,510
the role of the client what - what

346
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,510
endpoint to send this new piece custom

347
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,100
[Music]

348
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:27,800
request may be looking at the rest like

349
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:30,480
indifference for that there is one

350
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,180
possible reason why this is better than

351
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,900
a restful interface and that is the

352
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:39,030
server can do confirmation that the

353
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,200
clients got it rather than just doing a

354
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,200
and that's your back

355
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:46,389
so you can sit so if the server goes in

356
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:55,439
Econ message to that to each of the

357
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:58,689
recipients you don't get a response from

358
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:07,539
the receiver that they actually liked it

359
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:09,399
or something so yeah I think that that

360
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:15,429
is listed as one of the options as well

361
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:17,529
so I think these are not things that go

362
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:28,260
against each other it's more like

363
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:32,550
alternatives well

364
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,560
as a bird but this is a general document

365
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,389
and then the specific application

366
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:46,970
profile needs to define exactly which

367
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:49,560
mechanism to use yeah many alternatives

368
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:52,440
are trans a bit because they all need to

369
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:57,780
be implemented or need to be already

370
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:00,920
tested well they do if you offer them

371
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,810
and somebody picks them up you have to

372
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,640
this this document is not implementable

373
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,580
by itself it needs a profile that

374
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,490
specify the details and one of these

375
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:16,740
details is how do you do the rekeying

376
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:20,180
and really updating here so until the

377
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:28,220
profile comes along that we need this

378
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:28,220
okay note taken

379
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:36,480
okay so second point

380
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,870
another alternative mention for a king

381
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,150
is with multicast messages and the

382
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,949
client would not know what IP multicast

383
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,590
address he needs to listen to for a

384
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,570
keying so the proposal is to define a

385
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:52,350
new optional parameter breaking your eye

386
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:56,850
in the key distribution response and the

387
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:58,980
client it's that there should be the DC

388
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:02,399
uses this parameter to listen for

389
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,040
reading messages or the client uses this

390
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:10,350
parameter to listen for aching messages

391
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:12,270
but if the KDC that sends it so I think

392
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,469
we will go ahead and implement this

393
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,420
proposal so if there are there are no

394
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:21,210
strong objections and then we are happy

395
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:29,090
to get feedback and reviews and comments

396
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:32,250
about this when you actually implement I

397
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:40,139
mean like putting the document okay they

398
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:42,270
document that's it

399
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm a bit unclear about this Resta

400
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:53,700
fication what's gonna be the impact on

401
00:27:45,720 --> 00:28:18,360
the current document to justify that if

402
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:29,400
we do so before giving the floor to

403
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:32,340
Marco you can switch to the so this is a

404
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,860
slide from the pub/sub application

405
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,970
profile because we got these questions a

406
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,979
couple of times so there are these three

407
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,750
documents the one I just present in the

408
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,090
a ski group calm and then there are two

409
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,990
additional documents the coop pub/sub

410
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:51,480
profile at the a ski group home or score

411
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,910
and the profile and we get this question

412
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,960
how is this document different from the

413
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,360
a ski group calm

414
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,530
it looks like duplicated text and I

415
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:04,679
don't see what it adds so now I'm trying

416
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:07,290
to answer the question basically the a

417
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,150
ski group on the one I just presented

418
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,879
defines a general message format

419
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,160
fertilizing and providing keys to group

420
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,470
members in the context of group

421
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:21,420
communication it does not specify for

422
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:26,520
what communication transport protocol or

423
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:29,010
what security is used with this the a

424
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,030
score pops a profile define specific

425
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:37,410
content of a ski become two profile to

426
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:39,720
use it with coop pub/sub and cozy so

427
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,000
it's using cozy to protect the content

428
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,490
of the publication is using coop pops up

429
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,340
and the S key group from escort's

430
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:51,200
defined a specific content and format of

431
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,879
the general one to use it with court

432
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,130
communication RFC 7390

433
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,780
and using oscar group from as security

434
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:10,530
that's it that's the difference between

435
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:13,230
these two questions peter fonda stalker

436
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:15,840
it's the same remark I made just a few

437
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,300
minutes ago it I have to go from

438
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,370
undocumented to the other ash for lines

439
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,290
go back past four lines in the other

440
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,360
documents and that's the way I make

441
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,840
pocus and it's so bit embarrassing why

442
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,689
are these separated like this because

443
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,379
when I first came came here with the

444
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:37,650
coop pub/sub profile and that contained

445
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,720
everything in one document and then I

446
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:43,530
was told await this is a group

447
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,630
communication profile and you can reduce

448
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:50,370
this with Oscar communication and with

449
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:52,440
and with co-op group communication and I

450
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,780
said okay let's do that then I split

451
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,480
that up and I said you can reuse this

452
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,550
with group communication but you need to

453
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,620
structure it differently so I can only

454
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,409
do one we need to decide if you want to

455
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:08,479
do one document with all the profiles or

456
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:11,340
we want to do several with a more

457
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,470
structure in a different way so like

458
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,980
this is the idea base because of a

459
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,980
comment from the working group then we

460
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,960
can improve for sure on duplicate text

461
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:26,460
hopefully we can improve on not

462
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:30,300
repeating text and making it clear but

463
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:33,230
we need to decide on interaction so I I

464
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,700
think this is the better direction

465
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,110
otherwise we would have a huge document

466
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,300
with a lot of different things in it

467
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:48,530
where you would have to jump from one

468
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:48,530
section to the other so that's it

469
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,270
[Music]

470
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:22,649
which one is this doing - rice an update

471
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,229
on this application profile is a special

472
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:28,350
instantiation of the drug Francesca just

473
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:32,850
presented this version to also work king

474
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:34,740
group document quick recap but you

475
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:38,189
should be familiar with the main model

476
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,559
right now this is about authorizing

477
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,809
nodes to join a group where

478
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,210
communication is secured using group

479
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:47,129
post call and through the joint process

480
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,980
getting the key material necessary to

481
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,200
communicate in the group so as a first

482
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,049
step a client asks for an access token

483
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,659
to the AES the token is posted to the

484
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,940
group manager which is the KDC of the

485
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,159
general model and in the response it

486
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,750
gets back the key material and then can

487
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,559
use group of scores to talk to the other

488
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:10,620
group members what is out of scope of

489
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,928
this document is authorization for the

490
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,779
client to access resources at the very

491
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:19,740
group members hint that's the next

492
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:21,299
presentation and the actual secure

493
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:27,210
communication in the group well that's

494
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:28,860
just group who score a few updates from

495
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,559
previous version mostly based under here

496
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,199
we got from Jim on the previous version

497
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:38,490
of the document and from not big on the

498
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,840
latest submitted document most of the

499
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,600
things are aligned of course to the

500
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,699
corresponding updates on key group home

501
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,809
that Francesca presented so some

502
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,279
renaming of rosin profile name the use

503
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:53,279
of data structures essentially to

504
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,500
negotiate parameters on signature

505
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:00,030
algorithms and such between the joining

506
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,340
node and the group manager improve text

507
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,020
about provisioning of public keys from

508
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,939
the joining nodes and the concede

509
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,540
and she checks that the group manager

510
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,370
has to perform on them also considering

511
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,429
the case one possibly the group manager

512
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:19,980
already has from previous interactions

513
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:23,580
with the joining node its public key we

514
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,740
also extended the negotiation on these

515
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,899
public key related parameters and you

516
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:32,040
have fundamentally two approaches to do

517
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:33,630
that at least really embeddable in two

518
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,370
ways so that can happen during the

519
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,530
talking post and response or during the

520
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:41,810
joint request and response so it's more

521
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:44,280
as for information versus try on veil

522
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:48,409
also included the proof of possession of

523
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,780
the clients private key that we have to

524
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,790
slightly improve on just a mention and n

525
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,170
dimension in a following slide we have a

526
00:34:53,790 --> 00:35:02,250
few open points on these things speaking

527
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:04,490
which I mentioned already approach 1 & 2

528
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,750
for agreeing with the group manager on

529
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,600
senior parameters and calling of

530
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:12,090
publications on there's a third approach

531
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,080
it was also presented again this morning

532
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:18,030
in court in a nutshell discovering very

533
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,580
advanced the group and through that

534
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:23,940
discovering knowing very early about how

535
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:26,220
the group words meaning algorithms it

536
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,500
supports and that can be beneficial for

537
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,720
the joining all of course to just forget

538
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:34,920
about the approaches 1 & 2 and angle

539
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,899
full-speed for joining our line would be

540
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,880
to keep all three approaches in

541
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,920
principle supported in the draft without

542
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,950
particularly recommending or mandating

543
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:57,270
any and this is fine for everyone take

544
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:58,950
it as a yes when I'm surprised that

545
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:04,050
Kirsten is not coming up to say the

546
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:06,350
choices are bad he says it from from the

547
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,350
t1

548
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:19,680
there's more

549
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:34,410
which of these we need you so yeah I

550
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:39,598
think this book should be done yes yeah

551
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:42,149
so so the the with this work is looking

552
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,849
at the three options and find out what

553
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:47,310
we lose by not doing the specific one of

554
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:56,040
those options and deciding whether it's

555
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:58,710
was it Francesca as a co-author I think

556
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:04,099
it's good to keep all these options and

557
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:11,390
let the application decide Justin out

558
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:11,390
from the look of it I guess that as well

559
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,880
okay thanks

560
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,170
the second point there was a new

561
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,210
registry also define a key comb actually

562
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,819
and in this document instead we are

563
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,650
registering a value in it

564
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:33,720
specifying that public is in the group

565
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,270
are supposed to be encoded as Kazuki's

566
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,310
and right now we don't actually have any

567
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,829
particular plan to register any other

568
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,020
encoding that we cannot even think about

569
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:45,060
but still in principle it's good to keep

570
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,040
the way open for possible future and

571
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:52,349
codings why not but then the point is

572
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,619
would be a good registration policy to

573
00:37:52,349 --> 00:38:00,150
already suggest for the future here this

574
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,589
is a very open question assuming we're

575
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,829
find what made possible future and

576
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:03,828
goings

577
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,170
looks like Francesca got an idea

578
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:19,300
Kassadin Francesca I don't have an idea

579
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,740
I really want people to say anything in

580
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,900
their mind here because we need help

581
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:31,779
with this we don't don't have a proposal

582
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:38,430
we need we need ideas x.509 certificates

583
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:42,490
and and RC 50 70 to 50 public easy

584
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:45,970
potential candidates so I think it kind

585
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:51,750
of seems obvious that there should be a

586
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:51,750
way to register once they are needed

587
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:11,710
policy is probably more on the

588
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:15,820
conservative side like Jim shot from the

589
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:19,270
floor I don't think the registry is

590
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:21,970
needed I think we should use the cozy

591
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:25,630
heat the the the key confirmation

592
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:30,220
registry this part of the pop document

593
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:33,730
and then it's there for everybody who

594
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:44,680
wants it and people can register as they

595
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:47,280
need it okay for the proof of possession

596
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,470
of the clients private key during the

597
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,390
joint request/response exchange it works

598
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,430
pretty much as it was extended in

599
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,970
Francesca's comment on this key grow

600
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:00,640
calm of course here also to avoid in

601
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:03,459
Oracle we are about to sign both dances

602
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,250
one one got back from the resource

603
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,200
server one generated by the client we

604
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,330
just don't think there's really nothing

605
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,069
else to sign in addition to this we

606
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:16,600
don't need to bring in anything more

607
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:18,250
here and final check so we'll keep this

608
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,120
perfectly aligned with it keep your

609
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,120
comments in this ends

610
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:32,799
okay and this open point for came from

611
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:34,990
the latest review of loot dig this

612
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:36,930
concerns group freaking so for some

613
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,038
reason the group manager has to

614
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,169
redistribute the key material in the

615
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,750
group practically the ideas core master

616
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:46,299
secret and now the text is saying that

617
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,759
when doing that the group manager may

618
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:51,130
take a best effort so that all the group

619
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:56,619
members just continue having the very

620
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:58,630
same Center IDs and the best effort was

621
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:00,549
put there just to live a lot of

622
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,910
flexibility to the application the group

623
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:06,130
manager and for instance it can just a

624
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:10,200
factory the sender ad space in case this

625
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:12,700
happens upon many nos leaving but

626
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,519
probably it makes sense to consider an

627
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,390
alternative or a rephrasing so that the

628
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:21,669
group manager instead must or should

629
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,680
preserve the very center IDs for all

630
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:28,000
group members upon a full group working

631
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,250
and this is different from a corner case

632
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,680
when the goal of the group manager is

633
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,539
about tricking a single group member for

634
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,879
instance and that can be done by

635
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:43,960
assigning a new center ID exactly to

636
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:46,480
that group member only should we switch

637
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,970
and instead the main general case

638
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,960
highlighted there where the mass should

639
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:55,390
preserve the same and change and release

640
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,960
gym shot from the floor this should be a

641
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:01,240
must because if you don't do it among

642
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,220
other things everyone has to go retrieve

643
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,578
all the public keys again and that's

644
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,709
probably not a good idea I'm happy to

645
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:18,759
make it a must

646
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:20,859
thanks blue Drake from Jabbar why would

647
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:25,180
the GM the group manager Shaffer on

648
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:27,069
Sunday IDs okay so this is for the

649
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:31,029
corner case at the bottom of this slide

650
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:33,730
I suppose example if you have a single

651
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:34,299
group member whose sender sequence

652
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,029
number ops

653
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:39,009
round it has been formed the group

654
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:42,130
manager for sure and then the group

655
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:42,869
manager has two choices first Ricci the

656
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,619
whole group

657
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:48,459
distributing a new master secret

658
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:50,979
altogether and that of course has a big

659
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:54,399
impact on performance there is a

660
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:56,799
shortcut just as secure for the European

661
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,130
answer to justice ein the new sender ID

662
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:03,189
- that not only that no derive out of

663
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,949
that a new sender key and can resume

664
00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:07,660
communicating with sender sequence

665
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:10,509
number used especially we're starting

666
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,558
from zero of course the other group

667
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:13,449
members would have to derive a new

668
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,489
recipient context out of that but

669
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:18,449
overall the the reckoning process

670
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:21,189
especially on the wire is more efficient

671
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:23,529
but this is the particular case for an

672
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:32,678
individual node to rekey for instance

673
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:34,119
for the sake of rope around ok feedback

674
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:36,789
on the implementation side we are

675
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,650
continuing on that the rise

676
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:40,989
implementation covering the previous

677
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,519
version of all the drafts so essentially

678
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:44,859
the basic functionalities of this

679
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,689
profile and we have working progress on

680
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:50,019
aligning implementation of this latest

681
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:52,660
version plus admitting more than one

682
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:54,189
transport profiles so we start with with

683
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,739
the details profile where align that

684
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:59,199
also to work when the oscar profile is

685
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:01,539
used between the joining node and the

686
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:05,829
group manager there are also other

687
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:08,259
ongoing planned implementations from

688
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:10,209
peter engine yet we had already some

689
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:12,029
early tests the hackathon with join

690
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:14,140
request and response exchanges between

691
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:19,449
joining now than the group manager of

692
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:21,459
oscar so the summary of course as

693
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:24,189
predictable most of the updates were

694
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:26,739
related to keep in this align to kiku

695
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:29,769
come defining some more details typical

696
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:32,979
to this application profile we have a

697
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:36,729
number of open points some need more

698
00:44:32,979 --> 00:44:38,919
thought some are pretty clear among next

699
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:40,598
steps we'll do our best to simplify

700
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,079
shorter the document be to avoid

701
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:46,539
repetition from a comb will have to

702
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,400
process the latest review from ludwig

703
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:50,320
step by step

704
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,240
more reviews are welcome otherwise we'll

705
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,520
continue implementing and hopefully go

706
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,520
for a full interrupt in Singapore

707
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,789
[Music]

708
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,820
any comment from the room

709
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:26,570
okay this document is instead a new one

710
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:29,819
proposing a new transport profile a base

711
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:32,100
and useful group communication so to

712
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,290
secure communication between a client

713
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,650
and the resource server both members of

714
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,650
a group

715
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,630
why did we start this well you have an

716
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,850
application using group communication

717
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,680
and you want to use group of score to

718
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:50,430
protect the message exchange in the

719
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,859
group as I quickly mentioned before once

720
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,899
everyone is in the group would you do

721
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:58,859
about access control to access resources

722
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:01,109
at the group members well some use cases

723
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:03,240
are very simple they don't really need

724
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:04,830
any anything particularly difficult the

725
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,629
moment you have been authorized to

726
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,150
become a member of the security group

727
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,920
and you got the key material in those

728
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,980
use cases you can just assume that any

729
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,020
member can perform any operation at any

730
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,650
other group member at any obvious

731
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:22,920
resource and that can be fine

732
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:25,470
that can be not fine in some more

733
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,970
complicated use cases where essentially

734
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,669
you want to differentiate different

735
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:32,339
types of clients that are allowed to do

736
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:35,190
different things of different resource

737
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:38,400
servers in the group you may think of

738
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:42,000
creating additional security groups as

739
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,119
you need this risk scale very poorly you

740
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,290
need to create many groups perhaps

741
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,630
essentially one for each subset of

742
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,820
clients depending on the access rights

743
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,850
you want to grant them so instead it

744
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:55,200
will make sense to think of using ace to

745
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,799
enforce fine-grained access control

746
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,430
through access tokens and then if you

747
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,190
consider using Hayes you have a problem

748
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,529
if you think of the currently available

749
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:10,500
transport profiles of ace it's not

750
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:13,770
possible to secure group communication

751
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,190
in particular in particular using group

752
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:20,160
of score and every currently available

753
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:24,210
profile is considered a single security

754
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,190
protocol even if you think of the the

755
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:29,220
closest possible profile we can think

756
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,800
about the oscar profile kind pterosaur

757
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,799
service was to use an Oscar

758
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,500
and group of scholars just not admitted

759
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,360
so bottom line you cannot have at the

760
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,300
same time the usage of group of score

761
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,700
and an access control of resources at

762
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:48,780
group members based on ace

763
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:52,410
and the reason we started this document

764
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,140
is exactly to fill this gap so it's a

765
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:57,960
new transport profile base group

766
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,150
pasquale profile the strongly builds on

767
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,040
the score profile we're using a lot of

768
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,260
in construction of its constructions and

769
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,960
it essentially admits to security

770
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,120
protocols both Oh score and group of

771
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,930
score among group members and as a

772
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,279
starting point it assumes that the

773
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:17,790
client and restore server using this

774
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,980
profile are already both member of a non

775
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:22,800
score group that they have joined in a

776
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,410
band you run this profile and as a final

777
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,330
result you get a pairwise of score

778
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:30,359
security context between client or

779
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,069
server just like this core profile but

780
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,740
in addition here you have the access

781
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:38,250
token bound not only to the pairwise

782
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,799
context but also to the group of score

783
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,020
security context in addition the two

784
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,810
different contexts aisle are also bound

785
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,660
to each other and that's because we are

786
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:51,560
deriving the pairwise context using also

787
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:54,710
parameters from the group context

788
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:58,560
properties are the one typical of the

789
00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:00,330
expectations from profiles of ace plus

790
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,640
here we also have proof of group

791
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,350
membership for that exact client posting

792
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,370
the token thanks to the bond between the

793
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:11,040
token and a group context to give an

794
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:13,560
overview in a feasible way as Delta's

795
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,360
from the oscar profile first step the

796
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,560
client contacts the authorization server

797
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:22,200
asking for an access token as usual it

798
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:25,470
specifies two additional pieces of

799
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,830
information the sender ID has in the

800
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:31,919
oscar group and the group ID of that

801
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:33,750
group as values of two new parameters we

802
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,800
are defining for the access token

803
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:39,240
request it is validated by the

804
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,240
authorization server that releases the

805
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,790
token in the response to the client and

806
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,810
then reflected in the access token those

807
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,770
values

808
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:52,500
require again mostly for confirmation to

809
00:49:49,770 --> 00:50:11,759
the client and for information to the

810
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:14,280
restore server through the exit then the

811
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,970
client continues posting the access

812
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:21,000
token others or server and there is an

813
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:24,509
exchange of nonces just like it happens

814
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,280
with the oscar profile if the token is

815
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,350
valid there is our server stores the

816
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,990
extras talking together with those

817
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:33,120
junior additional parameters that the

818
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:37,439
client has specified and that were

819
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:41,759
included in the access token and here is

820
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,590
when things get interested for someone

821
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,960
interested in the extreme details this

822
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,350
is aligned to the second from last

823
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:54,480
version of your score profile but I can

824
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:57,720
skip that now client or server have to

825
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,600
derive the pairwise Oscar security

826
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:03,359
context as follows essentially they need

827
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,310
to prepare three parameters context the

828
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,990
remaster solve the master secret to

829
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:13,320
derive the context about the context ID

830
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:15,899
they concatenate the to nancy's plus one

831
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,300
more piece of information the group ID

832
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:21,930
of the oscar group that by the way the

833
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:24,390
server was able to retrieve also from

834
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:27,060
the access token for the master solved a

835
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,950
concatenate two pieces the first one is

836
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,200
the sender ID of the client in the oscar

837
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:33,569
group that was also included in the

838
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,899
master in the access token for the

839
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:39,930
resource server and if any because it

840
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:43,710
can be empty the master site used in the

841
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:46,109
oscar group context the master secret i

842
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:49,110
concatenate two pieces the first one is

843
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:51,000
the oscar master secret indicated in the

844
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,670
access token and provided also to the

845
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,140
client as an s-parameter

846
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,850
the second piece of information is the

847
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,250
master secret of the oscar group and

848
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,049
well both client and resource

849
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:06,470
know that because they are both member

850
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:16,890
of the group here's an example

851
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:18,600
first Peter if the coop it also takes in

852
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:21,450
change this every time you can make a

853
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:24,360
new group is that correct as you see

854
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,189
there yes and this is really thing and

855
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,860
it's a bit annoying maybe because

856
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:30,480
possibly want to specify the subset and

857
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,370
you remain that even though the group

858
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,710
may change and the coop member changed

859
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:36,089
so if you could just make the first part

860
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,040
of the group it there instead of the

861
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:40,650
whole group it I think that would be

862
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:47,820
more stable if one group changed okay

863
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:50,280
okay yes thanks as a quick example first

864
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,830
paling between the client and the first

865
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,530
or some server so x4 you talk and first

866
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,770
specifying the sender ID in the group of

867
00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:00,060
the client and the idea of the group

868
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:02,550
retrieve the token passed it to the

869
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:05,730
resource everyone they derive the

870
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:07,950
pairwise Oscar context well the client

871
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:10,050
repeats exactly the same to get an

872
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,850
access token to post at the resource

873
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:17,190
server to they derive their own pairwise

874
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:20,190
security context third step there can be

875
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:23,220
for instance first unicast requests with

876
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,570
a score from client or server and you

877
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:28,500
can see here the context that is

878
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:30,660
consistently extended and then you have

879
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,930
a multicast request protected with

880
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:36,390
record from C to the group and both

881
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:40,379
resource everyone until reply to the

882
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:42,990
client now for versions you don't have

883
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,970
already in a pin point out of a very

884
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:50,459
good discussion we had with Jim during

885
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:53,299
the a curtain thank you in the current

886
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:56,400
design there is a possible risk for

887
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,860
impersonation from one group member to

888
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,650
hurt another one

889
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,990
essentially you may have a node and one

890
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:08,340
in group that asks for an access token

891
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:11,879
but declaring the sender ID of an - and

892
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,200
one would get an access token for itself

893
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,849
if it's authorized to

894
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,149
you can post it to the resource server

895
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:22,470
but then if it uses all the unicast no

896
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:24,960
score since no strict identity and not

897
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:28,799
no confirmation of the sender ID event -

898
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,319
is involved the the consequences of dead

899
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:34,740
action performed legitimately by anyone

900
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:37,109
can be kind of shifted to n2 so the way

901
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:40,769
out for this is involving in the process

902
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:43,529
exactly the public key that n1 uses in

903
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:46,109
the group this can be provided to the

904
00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:48,569
AES upon request in the access token and

905
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:51,750
when doing that performing proof of

906
00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:54,299
possession then the other ization server

907
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:56,430
can include that public key also in the

908
00:54:54,299 --> 00:54:58,680
access token it will be posted on the

909
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,538
resource server that can then store the

910
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,609
access token paired also together with

911
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:05,609
that public key and that would

912
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:07,470
essentially fix that problem so we plan

913
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:12,720
for sure this update in the next version

914
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:15,598
of the document so as a final summary

915
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:19,379
this is a new transport profile of Ace

916
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,359
to admit the usage of Oscar and group of

917
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,279
score and a group communication scenario

918
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,410
where you need some fine-grained access

919
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:31,019
control on the group members resources

920
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:32,910
through ace both unicast pairwise and

921
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:35,008
group context are bound with each other

922
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:39,000
and the access token is bound to both

923
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:40,710
context as well and we are relying as

924
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,680
much as possible to a score and these

925
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:47,400
constructions just do not have an insane

926
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:50,660
Delta introduced here of course Commons

927
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,660
reviews are welcome

928
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:02,089
thank you

929
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:23,480
Jim shot from the floor do we actually

930
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:30,050
have a real-world use case for the ship

931
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:32,540
or is this speculation we can come up

932
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,690
with an example yeah that speculation

933
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:38,540
that speculation

934
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:53,060
I'm not backed up by any real-world

935
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:54,470
example of this case right now yes mine

936
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,770
fine

937
00:56:54,470 --> 00:57:01,730
so for those who were not following the

938
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:06,290
site discussion on jabber I think there

939
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:08,740
are a number of ace documents and one or

940
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:12,529
two core documents dealing with group

941
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:15,290
communication security now and it might

942
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:20,630
be quite helpful for someone coming to

943
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:24,950
one of these groups as a new participant

944
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:28,310
to have for example a wiki page or an

945
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:31,120
informational RFC that explains how

946
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:34,759
these group communication documents

947
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:39,460
interlink so if someone wants to

948
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:43,250
volunteer to write it up there is a

949
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:49,040
example that Francesca has in one of the

950
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:52,900
drafts but I think having it in one of

951
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,900
the drafts is not that helpful

952
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:58,990
Francesca my volunteer history thank you

953
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,990
very much

954
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:39,860
so I'm back today security for group

955
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:42,740
communication in ace okay so this draft

956
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:46,940
is about co-op pub/sub security

957
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:49,299
community security using ace we're at

958
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:52,550
version 5

959
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:57,920
so I already presented this slide by now

960
00:58:52,550 --> 00:59:00,950
I hope that I made a case yeah we can we

961
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,840
can discuss more on this but hopefully

962
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:06,410
we can keep with the current structure

963
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:11,420
and improve the text so that it's not as

964
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:13,730
confusing so quick recap on this

965
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:16,280
document this document defines how to

966
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:19,640
use a stew with rice nodes and provision

967
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,740
keys for co-op pub/sub the goal is to

968
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:25,100
protect co-op pub/sub communication

969
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:28,129
using the keys provided this RAF was

970
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:30,230
first submitted at IETF 98 it got

971
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:33,620
several reviews and bodies positive

972
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:36,140
feedback and it was then updated

973
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:39,500
following the ACE Group comm updates

974
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:41,660
after the split with that document there

975
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:45,290
is related work that is going on there

976
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:48,830
is the core co-op pub/sub that is close

977
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:51,680
to being done in core and then there is

978
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:55,069
the mqtt pub/sub profile vase that has

979
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,790
been adopted in this working group last

980
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:04,550
meeting I believe and then a picture to

981
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:06,140
show the members or participants in this

982
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:08,150
profile so we have the publisher

983
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:11,569
subscriber and the broker and this

984
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:13,190
profile aims at setting and security

985
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,590
association between the publishers and

986
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:18,170
the broker and one between the publisher

987
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,840
and the subscriber optionally also one

988
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:22,610
between the broker and a subscriber and

989
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:26,960
it uses two different authorization

990
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:29,330
servers there is also what we call the

991
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,990
KDC the key distribution center in the

992
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:37,270
general document that is in the same

993
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:37,270
node as the authorization server number

994
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:44,780
so we got a review very recently so

995
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:47,329
we're planning an update which we would

996
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,510
like feedback from the working group

997
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:55,720
about so this comes from a review but

998
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:59,839
yeah so the first request was to

999
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:01,129
generalize the exchange and split split

1000
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,690
the authorisation and key distribution

1001
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:08,270
requests which are now merged into one

1002
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:11,000
so to make it more similar to a ski

1003
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:13,220
group from a score with the fool first

1004
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,040
the ACE exchange and then the key

1005
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:19,939
distribution requests and response

1006
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:24,619
because this was these two requests were

1007
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:28,339
merged this was shorter and simpler but

1008
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:32,150
we were asked to actually split this out

1009
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:36,710
and possibly mention these merge as an

1010
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:45,680
example or an optimization any comments

1011
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:51,349
about that question is more general with

1012
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:54,740
an optimization example or optimized but

1013
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:57,859
less general Jim shot

1014
01:01:54,740 --> 01:02:04,700
I don't agree we don't demised more

1015
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:06,140
general no example if you have an

1016
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,879
example you have to document how to do

1017
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,220
the example yeah of course and I don't

1018
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,990
think it's working well the example

1019
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,779
would be what is now in the document

1020
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:17,930
with the two merged and with one node

1021
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,040
that is both a s2 and KDC but that also

1022
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,089
means that you have to do all the

1023
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:26,839
registration and so on and so forth yeah

1024
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:28,308
I don't since it is the text that is

1025
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:31,509
already in the document I don't think

1026
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:34,549
that would be very complicated to have

1027
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:37,640
but yeah we can I can try and then we

1028
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:39,170
can get reviews and see can we

1029
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,589
understand the document without the

1030
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:46,849
examples yeah okay the example would be

1031
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:49,290
the example of a more specific case

1032
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:51,840
where you merge the KDC and the

1033
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:56,790
yes there's still examples about the

1034
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:58,350
general okay so next point we use the

1035
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:01,980
Oscar mechanisms to do key derivation

1036
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:04,319
and non-stationary play protection so

1037
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,870
right now the part about actually

1038
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:12,560
securing the pub/sub it's only using

1039
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:15,930
cosy and with keys in place and just

1040
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:19,020
protecting the content the publication

1041
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:23,009
content so now we can make this better

1042
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:26,070
by using for example replay protection

1043
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:27,960
mechanisms sequence numbers and using

1044
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:38,160
the nonce duration that is you know

1045
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:42,260
score any comments about that Honus you

1046
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:45,089
don't need no score to implement this I

1047
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:48,330
I was just wanting like who provided the

1048
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:53,100
feedback to make those changes so this

1049
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:56,160
latest review was from Jim but we got to

1050
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:59,700
pay we got more reviews also for a

1051
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,589
previous version such a so you mean

1052
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,259
might be were people suggesting these

1053
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:06,270
these changes are sorry I cannot give

1054
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:09,330
you people suggesting these changes that

1055
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:14,220
you have up there now this one are only

1056
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:16,130
from the last review don't you yeah yeah

1057
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:20,060
they all come from this last review but

1058
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:20,060
previous reviews we're done as well

1059
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:26,930
another point is about defining the

1060
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:30,330
additional processing processing steps

1061
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:33,330
such as encrypt decrypt and verify with

1062
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:38,009
the material that would be defined above

1063
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:40,200
and then finally to do the updates to

1064
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,730
comply with the updates to a schedule

1065
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:45,390
from that I just mentioned in the

1066
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:48,050
previous presentation so the biggest

1067
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:53,940
change would be the first point and

1068
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:59,090
possibly the second but not the content

1069
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:59,090
is not yes it wouldn't change too much

1070
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:08,700
so the next steps would be to update

1071
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:11,280
first then we see or I think that this

1072
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,140
document is ready for adoption and I

1073
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,510
would like to get it adopted as soon as

1074
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:21,089
possible so that it can be moved forward

1075
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:23,340
with the MQTT pub/sub and mqtt pub/sub

1076
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:25,490
authors we're interested in this because

1077
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,560
they were interested in the part about

1078
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:30,839
protection of the publication content so

1079
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:39,960
maybe we can reuse that and synchronize

1080
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:57,750
with with them about that part how many

1081
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:59,640
people have read to draft any I know

1082
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,350
that there are more because there are

1083
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:08,819
some people's there they have provided

1084
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:10,740
reviews they're not in the room well I

1085
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:14,640
think we will take that to the list that

1086
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:18,319
we need definitely more reviews than the

1087
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,319
hand we've seen in in this room

1088
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:45,360
maybe that would be good the MQTT people

1089
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:51,110
review the draft as well especially if

1090
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,110
they have to see they have so that they

1091
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,230
[Music]

1092
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:11,790
okay any other business I have one item

1093
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:14,790
we had a choral side meeting this week

1094
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:20,550
and one of the things that was discussed

1095
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:25,620
in that was we need to probably define a

1096
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:28,740
choral vocabulary that can be published

1097
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:32,160
as part of a choral document so that

1098
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:34,919
people can locate things like

1099
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:40,170
authentication servers key servers and

1100
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:46,500
whatnot so we need to find some people

1101
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:49,170
to to do that and potentially there was

1102
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:54,080
a document which presented in court this

1103
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:54,080
morning that was a long time ago

1104
01:07:55,350 --> 01:08:03,180
the defines some link format attributes

1105
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:04,740
that do much the same thing and at that

1106
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,649
point in time I suggested that

1107
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:09,029
potentially that document should be

1108
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:11,490
migrated into this working group rather

1109
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:13,470
than stay in choral since it seems to be

1110
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:16,649
mostly focused on Advertising Age

1111
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:19,439
features so I expect both of those

1112
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:23,069
things to come to the list over the next

1113
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:27,710
month or so anyone else have anything

1114
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:32,210
else they want to say Ben do you want to

1115
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:32,210
say that you're reviewing documents

1116
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:43,988
I thought you were an area director I I

1117
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:48,819
do believe I'm an area director that

1118
01:08:43,988 --> 01:08:52,419
means she can tell a lie yes so I had a

1119
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:53,920
very busy two or three months just you

1120
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:57,370
know outside of work personal sort of

1121
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,370
stuff so basically all I was doing for

1122
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:04,719
the ietf 5sg was to review documents for

1123
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:06,219
the telecoms and so that means I was not

1124
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:10,390
reviewing documents for my working

1125
01:09:06,219 --> 01:09:12,969
groups and things kind of piled up but

1126
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:15,460
things in my own life have quieted down

1127
01:09:12,969 --> 01:09:18,130
in the past couple weeks or so and I'm

1128
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,930
clearing the backlog and mostly I'm

1129
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:22,120
doing it in first and first out

1130
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:23,859
but if there's a reason to prioritize

1131
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:26,649
something I'm you're happy to move

1132
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:30,580
things around right now I am in the

1133
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:32,950
middle of the CWT pump and I'm gonna do

1134
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:35,259
two or three more a Stockman's after

1135
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:37,630
that before you know something else was

1136
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:39,850
next in the list but we should be seeing

1137
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:43,120
some progress on the east documents in

1138
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:44,620
the next couple of weeks so we can hope

1139
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:52,140
to have reviews but from you on

1140
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:52,140
everything before the end of August yes

1141
01:09:54,238 --> 01:10:00,610
there's anybody else wanna stand up and

1142
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:14,489
make any statements to the ACE working

1143
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:14,489
group okay we will see you in Singapore

1144
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:30,130
blue sheet as everyone

1145
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,129
the blue

1146
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,020
you
