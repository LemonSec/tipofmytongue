2
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,429
yeah

3
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:15,239
okay let's go ahead and get started

4
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:16,950
welcome we have only 30 minutes some

5
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,840
things have happened in the past couple

6
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,010
days so we're juggling the agenda

7
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,019
quickly we'll see if we have time to get

8
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,048
to everything so we put it in priority

9
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,049
order

10
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:41,909
so just reminder on the intellectual

11
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:46,109
property you you must say if there's any

12
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:50,790
IPR associated with your drafts and your

13
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:55,109
contributions and in terms of anything

14
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,679
you say if the might as well this is the

15
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:01,560
no well you've been seeing it all day

16
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:07,109
yesterday so well but if you haven't

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:09,720
read it please pay attention to it blue

18
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,829
sheets are going around

19
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,829
we need a new ticker

20
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,739
someone please volunteer it's going to

21
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,459
easy today

22
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:43,690
Thank You robber can we have a joker

23
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:47,099
star this is just take to go to the mic

24
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:56,650
if anyone who is remote and wants to

25
00:03:47,099 --> 00:04:01,048
share something with the room okay I'll

26
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,049
do it let you run the meeting all right

27
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:11,230
we have two documents of progress you'll

28
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:16,599
see in a few minutes that the number has

29
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,099
gone up since we made these slides but

30
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,889
we're going to talk about them in this

31
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,150
order the first one is with the is G and

32
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:29,349
the second one has just been in last

33
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,750
call this is the agenda we're going to

34
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:37,659
deal with the amount of time necessary

35
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:43,870
in this order so I hope we get to

36
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:45,669
everything but we'll see okay and that's

37
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:54,960
it tradition lesser than the agenda

38
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:54,960
bashes all right Billy you're up

39
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,729
[Music]

40
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:21,159
okay good morning everybody my name is

41
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:24,690
Naveen amar I'm the main Otto the the

42
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:29,860
first author of the the district after

43
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:33,790
Alex left the draft in vision 43 so I

44
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,480
will give an update about what have been

45
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:42,460
done in this draft since version 44

46
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:47,140
until 15 currently we are in 50 but we

47
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:51,190
are expecting to to to post a new

48
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:59,380
version 51 after receiving some comments

49
00:05:51,190 --> 00:06:04,600
from a romanian ID so from 44 - 45 so we

50
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:09,340
have in 44 we have updated the author's

51
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:14,740
list and in 45 we have updated the

52
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,200
abstracts so that we can give more focus

53
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:21,370
on the the main scope so we have

54
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:24,460
redefined the scope so that's to animate

55
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,830
any ambiguity on what we want to do and

56
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,500
we want to achieve in this draft as

57
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:35,320
suggested by the main reviewer at that

58
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:37,840
time pascal figure so we have added in

59
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,550
ran of one another of i simply a to do

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,489
so we are dealing with ranch and that

61
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:52,360
any other optimization are out of scope

62
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:55,600
in in this draft from 44 to 46 we have a

63
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,560
new abstract which is more concise so

64
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,200
that we don't have much details in the

65
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,979
abstract and we keep them to the main

66
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:09,340
body of the text and we have introduced

67
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,530
that these drafts doesn't make

68
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,099
challenge in existing stack so with

69
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:20,020
minimal challenge to existing stack and

70
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:22,240
also we focus once once out of time that

71
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,640
the more complex scenarios related to

72
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:33,340
vehicular communication will be covered

73
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:36,159
in future work also in from 45 to 46 we

74
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:41,650
have specifying the scope also in the

75
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:45,130
introduction so we have now in 46 this

76
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,830
new text the document describes the

77
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,320
leading of ipv6 networking on top of the

78
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,219
I Triple E standard mock layer or I

79
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,730
Triple E 8 or 2.3 ma clear with a frame

80
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,910
translation underneath and we have added

81
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:05,290
these centers that the results in stacks

82
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,960
operates over 80 2.11 ocv and provides

83
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,720
at least peer to peer connectivity so

84
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,380
the term peer to peer was not in

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,960
previous versions of the draft using

86
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,570
ipv6 in d and link local addresses in

87
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,820
the extension and IP way of optimization

88
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,360
for vehicular communication are not in

89
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:29,590
scope because we have been dealing with

90
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,840
Pascal about what kind of Indy what are

91
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,949
the the limits of Indy when it comes to

92
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,049
vehicle communication etc so we made

93
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:45,730
this sentence so to clarify things

94
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:48,849
better in also we have in security

95
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:54,340
consideration we have added some some

96
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:57,070
ideas here so for example we added that

97
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,230
previous work at say V working group

98
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,570
present some threats while sent

99
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,480
presented in these children these two

100
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:08,070
RFC's is the solution against breast eft

101
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,570
but it's complex had not deployed these

102
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:15,940
comment was sent also by from from

103
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,510
Pascal but we had some other comments

104
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,970
from the 80s when it goes to the iesg

105
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:26,720
that why talking about

106
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,570
mentioning sand if it's complex had not

107
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,700
deployed and we replied that this is the

108
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,180
only solution that we have at that time

109
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:41,150
so this is what why we mention it in

110
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:44,719
this draft from 46 to 47 we have changed

111
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,030
the title so now we have this new title

112
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,770
of the the draft basic support for ipv6

113
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:55,550
over X cetera and yesterday I asked the

114
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:59,600
RFC editor if they can help even if it's

115
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:03,770
not the time it's not an FCS but if we

116
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,810
can gain some time to if we can receive

117
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,960
some feedback so they told me that the

118
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,530
title is a little bit long so maybe we

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,740
can we can think about it in next

120
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,170
version we have also included in the

121
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,050
introduction that the resulting stuck in

122
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:26,900
here it's from ipv6 over Ethernet so

123
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:28,969
these lenses also some debates in the

124
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,069
mailing list and with the ideas what we

125
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:36,430
mean by in heretic cetera we explained

126
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:40,430
that we do the same as in Ethernet as as

127
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:46,760
ipv6 defined in RFC 24 64 so there is no

128
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:51,280
charge and that's it yes for for this

129
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:55,069
version and then yes and this was one of

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:58,280
the hot topics hot debates which is

131
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:01,520
about the the length of the address or

132
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,720
the the interface identifier so we

133
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,300
specify clearly that independently of

134
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,370
the the method used to provide the even

135
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,650
identifier the left is 64 bits so if we

136
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,000
need any other if there is any comments

137
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,050
that should be discussed in other

138
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,890
working group not in IP wave from 47 to

139
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,550
48 Mohammed Boogedy thanks to Mohammed

140
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:32,510
he suggested he proofreads the whole

141
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:35,569
document and he suggests me in private

142
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,089
he sent me corrections proofreading and

143
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,910
such

144
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,910
some ameliorations to clarify some text

145
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:50,129
so many correction were made in this

146
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:55,559
version 48 in from 48 to 14 9 we had

147
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:58,920
some issues about the references which

148
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:03,649
are normative and which are informative

149
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:07,920
I think that can be I can happen in many

150
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:10,199
stage and hopefully we have solved this

151
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,300
problem and we fix it some remaining

152
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,959
typos in every time we have a lot of

153
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,920
typos

154
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:21,209
from 49 to 50 so it was the the ballot

155
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,059
so we got 10 okay so it's it's an okay

156
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:26,699
for the moment but we still have some

157
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:28,980
three discuss we reflected the comments

158
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:33,209
received from the IDS we removed to the

159
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,579
following not in so in the new version

160
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,809
which is 50 compliance with standard and

161
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,410
the regulation set in different

162
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,949
countries

163
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:44,160
when using the 5.9 gigai frequency band

164
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:46,349
is required we remove this part because

165
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,550
we don't need to deal with this detail

166
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,439
in in IETF no specific reason why this

167
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,589
needs to be said here so this is why we

168
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:58,469
remove this part I think this is what

169
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,689
the so this one was one of the main

170
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:04,790
comment of the of one of the discuss

171
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:11,189
so hopefully this discuss will turn on

172
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:14,279
okay the map pin to the exit so we have

173
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:18,300
this must that became a shirt because

174
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,929
one of the ad is say that must it's

175
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,929
strong here and is in this this idea

176
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:27,569
deals with I Triple E so why we need to

177
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:32,370
force something like that so we agreed

178
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:36,089
that this must be should I need to

179
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:40,769
remind the participant here that this

180
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:43,139
part of the draft was sent us as a

181
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:48,010
review from I Triple E 802 dogeleven

182
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:51,370
working group based on their review

183
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:55,480
a long review we we made this this

184
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:58,690
sentence here so we just changed the

185
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,960
must into shoot we also corrected the

186
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:05,020
normative use of may and should in the

187
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:09,040
text the normal way of writing this

188
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,900
these words also we reformulated the

189
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:20,110
text in subnet structure as pointed out

190
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:25,300
by Roman one of the 80s as follows so so

191
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:29,440
he suggested to to to rewrite but with

192
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:33,660
the help of Pascal we rewrite this this

193
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,130
part so we introduce the some specific

194
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,040
passivity is related to neighbor

195
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:47,830
discovery to reflect what we want to say

196
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:51,279
here and why nd with current ocv can so

197
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:54,960
I can lead to other works that can be

198
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,960
done in the future

199
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:03,640
we also reformist the Security section

200
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:06,339
because one of the ATS suggested that an

201
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,710
attacker may not heed to legal limit for

202
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,980
radio power and can use a very sensitive

203
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,980
directional antenna so it was okay so I

204
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,810
added this sentence if attackers wish to

205
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,700
attack a given exchange they don't

206
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,790
necessarily need to be in close physical

207
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,810
proximity so this detail was not present

208
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:29,110
in previous version what remains to do

209
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:33,819
is to answer one last comment in the

210
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,490
discuss that we have now of Roman which

211
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,540
deals with pseudonym handling so I think

212
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:44,980
we have now with the help of Erik we

213
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:48,579
have now I think a good text that Roman

214
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,220
will I I hope will will agree on so

215
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,790
that's it for for these versions

216
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,770
so in equation our comments are welcome

217
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,949
thank you

218
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:04,579
say what are you going to say to

219
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:09,180
addresses so we are we have just sent

220
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:12,540
few lines to Roman and we can die and we

221
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,469
are still waiting for his feedback just

222
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:21,360
to fix the the this short paragraph

223
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,710
about what is the the the the difference

224
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
between what is the impact of

225
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,020
confidentiality because we used the term

226
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,420
confidentiality in the text it was on

227
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:35,240
big use for him and we changed it into

228
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:38,849
the identity of the destination and

229
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:42,360
making the trust because identity is not

230
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,090
as confidentiality its to term different

231
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,800
so we have proposed to to change these

232
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,950
two terms that's it that's the main

233
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,390
change that we have in this section

234
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,890
suresh krisshnan so Russ like in charge

235
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,340
it tastes like the upper layer protocol

236
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:58,439
should take care of it like that's the

237
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:02,240
gist of this Texas like propose to roman

238
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,950
okay thank you thank you okay so

239
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,650
basically when you get the okay from

240
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:12,450
from any you will be submitting version

241
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:14,070
51 yes and then we will ask the the

242
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,720
three scums because there are three

243
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:21,260
discussions to check if they are fine

244
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,260
and 2/3 of that okay thank you

245
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:33,200
[Music]

246
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:39,889
hello everybody this is poor John from

247
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:43,040
SK kill you so basically this IP waive

248
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:48,810
promise statement document liberated by

249
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:51,810
Charlie pockys and three and basically

250
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,790
three kundo barely certified with on

251
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:57,300
this television and Charlie Kaiser he

252
00:17:53,790 --> 00:18:01,500
looks like didn't finished and Libya yet

253
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:09,570
but I believe most of his comments are

254
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:12,120
addressed so after last the prom meeting

255
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:18,120
revised it two times it so right now the

256
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,290
version is 11 so so I will explain to

257
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,570
Orly be jealous

258
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:28,350
so the first revision from 9 to 10 so

259
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:31,439
from a chali so the question is the

260
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,959
mortar linker so Burnette models so this

261
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,180
is the problem statement so I remove a

262
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,520
multi-link a sudden a discussion just we

263
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:42,600
specify characteristic of a virtual or

264
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,290
linker model is it symmetric and so

265
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,840
mobile attack and that took property so

266
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,510
we just addressed and also he mentioned

267
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,639
the DNS motivation the pqy Deanna's

268
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:58,440
important so I explained it especially

269
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:02,850
in beaker has a lot of issue unit so

270
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:07,770
they can be lester their own domain name

271
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:10,709
or so remotely automotive services enter

272
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,940
can remote a monitor regulator so in the

273
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,590
case dns laceration also these are

274
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:21,240
resolution is important so that's why I

275
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:23,639
added a some text so in appendix I added

276
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,940
that detail changes so you can refer to

277
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:31,820
that so timing issues Andy so the you

278
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:37,590
can see the national highway traffic

279
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:40,530
agencies as a product service as

280
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,350
appetizers thank you so they mentioned

281
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,960
the 0.25 the second very important

282
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,030
timing to avoid accident

283
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,580
so in the case the neighbor discovery

284
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:58,080
message if used for the safety a message

285
00:19:52,580 --> 00:20:02,120
0.25 exchanges required so depending on

286
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:05,220
tentative vehicle we can adjust the

287
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:09,959
interval of neighbor discovery message

288
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:13,410
so I added a tap text next the security

289
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,870
consideration case expanding the

290
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,690
considered neighbor discovery part and

291
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,189
the mobility management part so I added

292
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,650
a some text

293
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,260
the secondly this you can see

294
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,930
documentation predicts Charlie maybe

295
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,510
some confused why what is it is so this

296
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,460
is you can see the documentation

297
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:35,160
predicts right for the example

298
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,000
so definitely any allowed rubber IP

299
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,600
version 6 address it can be loud trouble

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,670
in Bennett and V killer Edie vehicle

301
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,419
Annette on including infrastructure

302
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,810
loader RS use also the third one in the

303
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,560
piggy run case the separate vehicle on a

304
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:58,260
dog netted panel can be merged to using

305
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,679
infrastructure node over newly a joining

306
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:05,070
of vehicles so you can see two separate

307
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,960
a banach can link with the

308
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,470
infrastructure loader all the other

309
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:16,460
arriving not I mentioned and that part

310
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:19,260
and suggestion are how a good a nose

311
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,880
depress the prom a better nose or so we

312
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:26,330
I added a text so certificate can be

313
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,070
used to authenticate the beaker so I

314
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,370
mentioned the high lever so our a

315
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:38,030
document again is for problem Stateville

316
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:42,389
letter then giving the solution so and

317
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:45,990
Burton ten case I reflected the chalice

318
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,390
the editorial comment so many editorial

319
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,410
comments are addressed some several

320
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:54,600
questions case in the appendix that I

321
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:57,660
address the what change are ton and

322
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,129
three hakuna volley case the article she

323
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:06,090
a fifty eighty five zero five reference

324
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:09,540
this is for the six all of em the

325
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:12,750
address alliterations optimization so in

326
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:16,710
this text that we can lead up them just

327
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:20,340
may be the solution development the page

328
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,850
we can consider so we tell it either

329
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,520
next step is after confirmation of a

330
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,639
charlie and then Carlos will leave you

331
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:34,850
and then we can call last call and then

332
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,850
we can submit is G okay that's it

333
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,450
I scan I miss the reason why you remove

334
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,510
tags denied her for five is that because

335
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,610
you're not talking solution hmm I did

336
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:53,950
not understand why you removed that text

337
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:57,310
okay three his comment the years that

338
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,440
and the optimization is the possible a

339
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:03,159
good solution but our problem statement

340
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,500
the case we don't imagine it may be how

341
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,030
we can discuss that's because you don't

342
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
enter solution space that's because

343
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:14,830
you're in promised ice that's very good

344
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:17,410
yeah yes yes yeah okay so yeah basically

345
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:21,610
we will wait until suddenly confirms

346
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:23,950
that this is happy with the review yeah

347
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,750
just closing on the last comment exactly

348
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,220
I think it's not touching on the

349
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,970
solution that's one thing second thing

350
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,030
is this was the last minute you know the

351
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,800
comments you know but that you are

352
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,870
addressing were mostly based on the

353
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,090
reviews from Charlie and others right

354
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,370
there as to some discussion randomly we

355
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,470
cannot insert some new sections without

356
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:54,489
any discussion in the mailing list right

357
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:56,200
so there's a reason why so it was scary

358
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,700
yeah I don't buy the last argument if

359
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,680
you say if you say okay that's not a

360
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,630
subjective document I completely buy it

361
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,610
if you tell me it's because we don't

362
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,670
discuss enough well let's discuss right

363
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:10,179
now that you can't just remove text

364
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:13,380
that's odd because it's like if you say

365
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,730
okay we have to ship now so whatever is

366
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,980
discussion is pending we don't take it I

367
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,930
don't buy that I mean you want a good

368
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,010
document and if you want a good document

369
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,170
then you want to make sure you have

370
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:26,379
settled on the issues right so if there

371
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,820
was a good reason to mention it then and

372
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,260
you remove it just because you decided

373
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,280
at the last minute that's not fair

374
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,760
either right

375
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,470
so so the group must are the consensus

376
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,790
either way we want to talk about it we

377
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,890
don't want to talk about it it's the

378
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,570
right document wrong document but you

379
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,920
can't just make a decision like that in

380
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,230
a work group document just at the moment

381
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,820
you do last call to snip some document

382
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,660
effect without the group saying yes you

383
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:53,169
can

384
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:53,830
right so the text that showed up in that

385
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,110
version

386
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,580
there was no priority discussion it's

387
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,679
just a randomly showed up that

388
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,169
intersection point of our point number

389
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,990
two again this spec is about

390
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,370
requirements right so we are not

391
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:13,690
touching I think those for those reasons

392
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:16,360
I said you know they should be okay so I

393
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,100
mean we we can have discussion if

394
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,129
somebody thinks that it has to be the

395
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,610
earth text but I read that it's not

396
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,040
about solution the document okay so then

397
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,949
I was instead we're saying we'll wait

398
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,620
for Charlie to confirm and then once at

399
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,830
least happy with the review I will I

400
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,830
will

401
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,080
okay so we moved to the hackathon

402
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:46,810
propose just one minute it enough

403
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:50,230
because yeah and so basically this has

404
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:53,500
only the second time hackathon we so I

405
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,980
think that first card the solution of

406
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,710
our solution is the proto-tool heated

407
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,620
previous the work also the hackathon

408
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,070
project case we approved the OCB and

409
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,959
also one possible solution on the big

410
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:14,710
hill neighbor discovery the multi hub at

411
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:17,770
dat so we proved concept and so the

412
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,680
basically we using this multi hub at the

413
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:23,740
ad to lead years at the ad arm delay or

414
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,660
so we can allow picker can start the TCP

415
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,420
connection Egyptian and possible using

416
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,700
the multi hub adding network and the

417
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,070
impact on network so we extended the

418
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:39,310
connectivity so we probably using the

419
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:43,629
simulation and okay so the appendices

420
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:46,330
are explained and this website can show

421
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,990
the video clip and github that's it

422
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,270
thank you

423
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,120
yeah so if you have a question fully you

424
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:55,110
can discuss so Paschal you have yeah

425
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,110
short time

426
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,240
yes if you want one are you talking that

427
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,740
are you saying that you're flooding the

428
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,440
dead of are multiple Hopf so you're

429
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,370
actually doing a big flood for that well

430
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,010
that's the one thing we just did not

431
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,658
want it absolutely to avoid in the type

432
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,520
of networks that right yo has been

433
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,220
working on right because because of the

434
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,440
bandwidth that the flooding cost you

435
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,600
know the flooding well each broadcast is

436
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,669
that at the slowest speed possible and

437
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,500
if you have to flood it that means

438
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,179
you're basically consuming all the

439
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,850
bandwidth for everybody time you want to

440
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:37,600
form or just check in your dress and

441
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:40,570
well many environments is just not

442
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,520
acceptable they can't see that it would

443
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,080
be acceptable the CD I don't just don't

444
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,000
see why it would be acceptable because

445
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,559
not you get it of course the only thing

446
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,659
you will see is that on your network

447
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,289
there is nobody else or anything else

448
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:55,390
not not quite a good idea so the way six

449
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,970
load has that of our multiple hearts is

450
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:00,789
unicast so you need to have for a given

451
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,380
subnet a registry and you just unicast

452
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:05,289
check that registry that's how you avoid

453
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,000
the flood because the flood with just

454
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:09,940
one call it looks great then you have

455
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,830
one thousand cars you know nothing works

456
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:16,900
okay so inter pastor the adding load

457
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,960
mark are he suggested we need to

458
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:24,070
consider a multi up the ad with the

459
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:27,669
unicast so that's why we implemented

460
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,530
some possible solution but once we the

461
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:37,539
penises promise statement document can

462
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:50,889
discuss it not just example do you plan

463
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:56,860
to do some real OCB yes definitely yes

464
00:28:50,890 --> 00:29:00,730
my group already have the Kota Wireless

465
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:06,270
our Cu and ODU so we will test paper

466
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,270
protocol okay thank you yeah so yeah

467
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,989
yes thank you for pointing out to the

468
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:15,570
hackathon so we made the two hackathons

469
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:18,960
in the past one in Dakar and second one

470
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,580
in Kampala last month during the Africa

471
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,470
internet summit so we got two good

472
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,749
results because we are using not

473
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:29,519
simulation but real cards and to test if

474
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:32,519
there is possibility to to connect and

475
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:37,099
to send pings and we use in Wireshark to

476
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:41,549
capture and to see the the frame and all

477
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:44,729
fields and all details that's what we

478
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:50,220
want also to do next time okay thanks

479
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:52,649
thank you I guess we don't have time for

480
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,970
for the presentation if they I mean for

481
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,639
those are interested on that

482
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,190
Piscotty within six month I mean six

483
00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:03,299
long six robot a like a standard version

484
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:13,529
right so you can take the video

485
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:15,539
recordings if you sure yeah okay okay we

486
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:28,729
we are done Thanks where are the blue

487
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:28,729
seats okay thank you
