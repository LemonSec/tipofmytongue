1
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,849
so we're just playing with

2
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,489
[Applause]

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,319
[Applause]

4
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,980
[Music]

5
00:04:34,970 --> 00:05:10,070
it doesn't switch out so I guess if that

6
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,070
doesn't work

7
00:05:20,680 --> 00:06:26,440
so you can see the red was working when

8
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:32,550
we come in the room then stops I guess

9
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,550
which okay

10
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,859
[Music]

11
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,379
[Music]

12
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,880
[Music]

13
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,029
[Music]

14
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:56,940
all right thank you yes so the technique

15
00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:00,040
though may I have your attention please

16
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:12,790
okay so the technical problem was solved

17
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:16,500
by turning it off then on again so

18
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:21,010
welcome to the Lake Bluff lightweight

19
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,399
take for IOT we do know that using the

20
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,890
word words like lightweight or simple

21
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:31,480
for protocols gets you in the future

22
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:34,600
four hundred page document but we're

23
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,100
risking it anyway so this is the note

24
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:42,820
well you've seen it at least once since

25
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:46,269
this is out of this week and here's the

26
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,940
agenda so missus administrivia and

27
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,709
history of the twelve now I do the blue

28
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:55,870
sheets are going around and we do have a

29
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:57,670
jabber scribe and minute taker who will

30
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,810
then go through a requirement

31
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,910
presentation and then two shorter

32
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:08,140
presentations about the proposed

33
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,870
solutions and after that we'll see the

34
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,790
proposed charter and have the Charter

35
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,300
discussion and the usual both questions

36
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,339
and after which we can to either talk

37
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:26,620
more about the charter or more about the

38
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:31,120
requirements so any agenda bashing no

39
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:34,839
good so about the process well there

40
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,120
hasn't been any decision made the is G

41
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,740
is not has not decided to set up a new

42
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,980
working group if they had they would

43
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,440
just set it up above comes to answer the

44
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,120
questions about whether the community is

45
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,430
ready for a working group

46
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,990
so it's not a foregone conclusion and

47
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,819
the most important output of this

48
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,040
meeting is whether we are recommending

49
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:57,180
to the ISD because ultimately it's their

50
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,689
decision to form a working group or not

51
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:04,300
so if the answer is yes and then we have

52
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:06,219
still not decided on the solution and we

53
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,199
still haven't decided the requirements

54
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,139
there is a requirements draft or is a

55
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:13,180
requirement presentation but the

56
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:17,529
requires are not final they are still up

57
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,839
in here and so we can add requirements

58
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,689
remove requirements dispense with them

59
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,480
entirely and do something else anything

60
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:27,459
goes

61
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,240
certainly a good output from this is a

62
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:34,779
recommendation on whether to set up or

63
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,490
not set up a working group and as much

64
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,740
as we can about the requirements

65
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,269
although they will not be final

66
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:46,720
requirements so usually part of the

67
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:48,999
deliverables of a working group so this

68
00:11:46,720 --> 00:12:01,240
is sort of a timeline of how long we've

69
00:11:48,999 --> 00:12:03,429
been doing this quite a while so just as

70
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,050
a check because there have been a bunch

71
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,610
of discussion about this on sac dispatch

72
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,008
there was this virtual interim eating

73
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,649
that went into this in detail how many

74
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:13,509
people would would think themselves as

75
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:20,829
pretty familiar with this particular

76
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:23,970
topic okay so that's like maybe more

77
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:27,128
than 50% of the room how many people

78
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:32,019
think how many people are there for whom

79
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:35,290
this is a totally new thing only a few

80
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:37,509
okay so I guess for the presenters then

81
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,730
I don't you don't need to kind of go to

82
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:41,920
excruciating background from for most of

83
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,779
the room I think but if you're in the

84
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,019
room and you haven't been familiar with

85
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:48,999
this before then you know let us know

86
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:54,259
and ask the presenters clarifying

87
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:57,350
questions as needed sorry okay cool so

88
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,169
that piece there were going for the

89
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:04,549
presentations and we're starting with

90
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:06,109
the chronic scorn so so just plus an ad

91
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:09,019
goes to Mike we wanted to just have

92
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:11,539
clarifying questions at these for these

93
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:13,279
three presentation slots and then have

94
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,199
discussion after those have happened

95
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,269
because again most of you are familiar

96
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,699
with a lot of this so you know hopefully

97
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:26,350
don't need to do too much both very

98
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:40,339
clarifying okay hello everybody

99
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:43,299
can you hear me great so I'm your answer

100
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:47,539
lambda and I'm going to talk about

101
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:51,319
requirements for for lightweights key

102
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:54,399
exchange protocol for all score so

103
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:57,439
basically if you read the Charter

104
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,649
proposal which is the outcome of the

105
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:02,769
discussion insect is but the lake is is

106
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,999
about specifying a lightweight

107
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,339
authenticated key exchange protocol for

108
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:11,959
all score which recently has become an

109
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:15,529
RFC and the requirements are therefore

110
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,029
based on on the conditions for how Oscar

111
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,759
is being deployed in constrained

112
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,559
environments just to clarify I mean so

113
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,119
this is Lauren's view of the

114
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,279
requirements exact going into the bath

115
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:27,439
it's not that these are the formal grade

116
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,569
requirements for everybody right yeah at

117
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:31,699
least this was this was a security ad

118
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:35,149
summary of the discussion insect

119
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:37,669
dispatch as you can see from the Charter

120
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,589
yourself so have a look now we've come

121
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:43,399
to the Charter that's not the end of the

122
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,289
presentations and this is not a new

123
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:50,769
subject in the ITF it's been on the

124
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:55,159
agenda for since 2016 I think and

125
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:57,139
extensively discussed during spring with

126
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,409
a virtual interim dedicated to this

127
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,409
topic

128
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,880
after this virtual interim I was asked

129
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,640
to compile the requirements summarizing

130
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,110
the discussion and I did that and I got

131
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,830
some more comments and I updated that

132
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:19,040
that's the version we are going through

133
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:21,140
in this live set right so first a couple

134
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,689
of slides on well score if you're not

135
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:28,069
familiar with with that so Oscar is a

136
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:34,160
communication security protocol for coop

137
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:38,210
and it's basically intended to protect

138
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,240
what's called a co-op request response

139
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:45,110
right layer which is the upper sub layer

140
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,860
of co-op and people so you can think

141
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:52,070
about it like a rest layer and including

142
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:56,060
things like protecting payload your eye

143
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:58,880
paths and code and it doesn't protect

144
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,430
things like the messaging sub layer

145
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,330
that's lower sub layer of coop which is

146
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:07,670
the binding the UDP and therefore it's

147
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,250
suitable for it's easy to change

148
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:15,099
transport protocol without changing the

149
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:19,430
protection of of the actual rest message

150
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,860
so that's also inherently provides some

151
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,109
features where you could introduce

152
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,180
proxies and proxies could make changes

153
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,660
to these headers which are not protected

154
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,900
which enables forwarding and takis

155
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:37,730
proxies and other good functions for IOT

156
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:42,530
deployments Oscar was initially designed

157
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,360
for both unicast and multicast and that

158
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,430
has turned out to be an interesting

159
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,340
feature from an industry point of view

160
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,229
like the light being industry who think

161
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,910
this is a good good idea that you could

162
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,240
protect multicast it's over co-op

163
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,209
communication so many deployments are

164
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,380
expected to have both unicast and

165
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:06,589
multicast functionality it's defined in

166
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:10,640
terms of IOT primitives such as coops

167
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:13,188
Ybor and cozy and

168
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,949
that makes it suitable for lightweight

169
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:20,240
deployments and it also has a little

170
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,610
message overhead so our score is now an

171
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,589
RFC

172
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,319
but there is nothing there is not an A

173
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:33,020
ke which could be used for providing

174
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,760
peer-to-peer for secrecy and so in

175
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,490
prepared peer deployments to get forward

176
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,340
secrecy and also forgetting public key

177
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:45,320
based authentication you know between

178
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,899
peers so that's just a background here

179
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,850
some examples over here where our score

180
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:56,090
is being used applied a number IDF

181
00:17:52,850 --> 00:18:01,059
working groups and also other IOT for us

182
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:04,699
or other either specifying its use or

183
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:08,450
referencing it or has shown an interest

184
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,190
to deploy or score and on the right to

185
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:14,890
see a number of development and testing

186
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:17,809
activities which includes things like

187
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:20,270
hackathon activities the multicast was

188
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:24,190
tested day before yesterday in the

189
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:28,970
interrupt test a number of open-source

190
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:32,559
projects and other things going on ok so

191
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,559
now we'd go to the requirements

192
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,149
obviously if you're gonna be in a key

193
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:43,970
exchange protocol for all score you need

194
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:48,410
to provide the input and be transported

195
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:55,390
that's all score so Oscar needs a master

196
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:59,390
secret that's used for driving the

197
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:02,150
encryption keys and this master secret

198
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,559
should have the good properties perfect

199
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:09,130
for secrecy a good amount of randomness

200
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:12,260
one score also needs to have sundry T's

201
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,330
which are peer identifiers and then

202
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,860
intubation should be able to be

203
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,970
arbitrarily short because they are sent

204
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,919
in each message and we also need cozy

205
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,320
algorithm switches

206
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:31,070
encryption and hkpf Albertans used by

207
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:34,909
Oscar okay next is authentication

208
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,580
credentials and for since their various

209
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:40,190
different kinds of IOT deployments we

210
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:45,290
need both to have symmetric and

211
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:48,350
asymmetric and circling deployments are

212
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:51,260
only pre shared so you have provisioning

213
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,300
appreciate keys that's important and

214
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,450
republic keys also have a natural role

215
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:00,680
in in IOT deployments and you don't want

216
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:05,420
to send certificates there are

217
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,190
additional credentials requirements

218
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,180
being discussed on the mailing list

219
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,460
I didn't we haven't completed on that

220
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,980
but basically that's and I noted that

221
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,750
here is an indication that requires

222
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:24,260
discussion is still still ongoing keeps

223
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,780
my understanding was that you see Oracle

224
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,490
keys you also need a short identifier

225
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,930
which refers to a public key as opposed

226
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,800
to budget care in the public key and

227
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,970
then also energy fifty right yes I mean

228
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,129
basically there are different ways of

229
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,530
identifying that's that's not really

230
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:43,760
covered by the requirement it's sort of

231
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:46,160
the the fact that you can use a public

232
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,610
key which is not certified in itself

233
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,000
that's so do you so that's does that

234
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,000
answer the question

235
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,490
only only cleared the keys in the end

236
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,720
it's a different set of requirements

237
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,670
somewhat different requirements if you

238
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,740
after a tournament it's not it's not

239
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:07,070
triggered it's like it's not doesn't out

240
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,810
reveal so I didn't really understand

241
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,879
could you could be spent sure

242
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,530
so some oppose will I've seen involving

243
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,990
very short public identifiers on this

244
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,149
bait on the world of Viper to write and

245
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,370
sort could speak a little slower my

246
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,890
designs I've seen involve having very

247
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,530
short public identifiers or byte or two

248
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,200
and then the public key is then is then

249
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,330
carried externally right right and so

250
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,800
that is that's a different protocol

251
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,389
requirement from being able to carry all

252
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,980
the keys in the protocol and actually

253
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,929
have some somewhat different

254
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,110
so I just wanna make sure that's it

255
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:42,950
that's required I'm sorry I really have

256
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:45,279
our time to understand but I think I'm

257
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,279
sorry all right

258
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,509
the material that the two sides have to

259
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,889
agree upon is literally the Rafah the

260
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:03,380
key and there's no external

261
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:04,309
certification or sir - or trusting or

262
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,029
anything like that

263
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:10,549
and Eric is trying to ask about how you

264
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:13,429
translate to do bits on the wire

265
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:15,710
whether you are gonna say I have a rock

266
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:18,080
with a key and I'm always sending the

267
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,389
full you know hover my octaves above a

268
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,549
key or if you might also want to

269
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:24,080
consider a case where the two parties

270
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,049
house and through the auto pan database

271
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,389
to say I'm gonna send you the octet five

272
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,750
and you secretly know that that matches

273
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:34,758
to the your active right okay that was a

274
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,389
key identifier part I suppose yeah okay

275
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:41,000
so yes I mean that the point is that

276
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:45,100
there are both these type of deployments

277
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:53,389
so I don't see any problem - those are

278
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:56,658
all requirements okay yet that we have

279
00:22:53,389 --> 00:23:02,178
the capability part these are things

280
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:04,730
which are built into infrastructure in

281
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:08,690
long lifetimes so you you need to be

282
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:11,389
able to support change of algorithm so

283
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,850
having multiple algorithms and securely

284
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:16,959
negotiate them so that goes all both

285
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:22,519
with the score algorithms somebody a key

286
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,679
algorithms and then we come to the

287
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:30,559
lightweight part which is what's been

288
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:33,409
discussed most so the light what you

289
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,720
mean by light weight is that it should

290
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:40,039
be low in resource consumption as

291
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:43,039
measured by fights on the wire wall

292
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,960
clock time to complete so from starting

293
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,220
with the protocol to the

294
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,409
and power consumption and amount of new

295
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:56,559
code required on an end system which

296
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:59,179
already has a no score stack basically

297
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,240
this is also the formulation coming out

298
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:07,220
of of of the secretary

299
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,110
discussion and some of these are easy to

300
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,600
quantify whereas others are more

301
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,189
difficult to quantify and that's

302
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,980
basically what this light use discussion

303
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,409
has been about - how do we quantify this

304
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,370
how do we compare two protocols and say

305
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:24,169
this is a better protocol so bytes on

306
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,080
the wire is fairly straightforward if

307
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:30,890
you look at the message sizes of the

308
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,379
other protocol light on the wire is also

309
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,770
important because as we shall see in the

310
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,779
benchmarks coming after this slide it

311
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:44,090
impacts time to complete and it impacts

312
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:48,289
power consumption world lock time can

313
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:50,500
also be translated into protocol

314
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:53,960
requirements like looking at round trips

315
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:59,440
so as few round trips as possible is

316
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:02,750
sort of a consequence of this l1 here

317
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,159
which means that we are back in practice

318
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:09,169
looking looking for a 1:1 trip protocol

319
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,760
which is mutually CENTAC ated so when

320
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:17,720
you have at least three messages power

321
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,760
consumption is one thing that that

322
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,820
depends a lot on the circumstances of

323
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,260
the deployment so a particular radio

324
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,740
technology so there's one of the

325
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:31,730
benchmarks is looking at that and

326
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:38,200
finally the indication of the sort of

327
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:42,789
the code complexity aspect is based on

328
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:51,049
how how a given a score implementation

329
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:53,059
can be reused in terms of of code so so

330
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,770
these are very general statements and it

331
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,920
would be requested specifically during

332
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:01,440
the second batch process

333
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:04,060
come with concrete measurable benchmarks

334
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,120
there were three benchmarks presented

335
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,190
and they were designed by experts on

336
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,870
these technologies and these three are

337
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:18,130
specifically relevant to us core that's

338
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:23,379
why they were selected so narrowband IOT

339
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:26,020
the wrong and sixth issue and each of

340
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,270
them are using input based on message

341
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:33,340
sizes which is specified in an L wig

342
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:36,580
draft and the task of comparing security

343
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:41,530
protocols was also a task that was given

344
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:43,000
to us during this long period so that's

345
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,010
important that when we are comparing

346
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,690
protocols we actually see make the same

347
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:51,300
set same assumptions so it's the first

348
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:55,720
benchmark is looking at narrowband IOT I

349
00:26:51,300 --> 00:27:02,370
energy consumption Melbourne by Ooty is

350
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:04,810
licensed spectrum with low data rates so

351
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,340
as a consequence of being licensed

352
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,100
device is allowed to have a high

353
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,050
transmit power and the consequence of

354
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,740
low data rates in combination with this

355
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:19,330
means that there is a high provide

356
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:22,780
energy consumption so the benchmark we

357
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:25,120
are looking at is the energy consumption

358
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,800
of the key exchange based on a

359
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,520
computational model used in the 3gpp

360
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,379
when they design these type of radio

361
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,580
technologies and here is just one

362
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:39,730
example of a table and I mean a general

363
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,060
conclusion looking at this benchmark and

364
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,140
this this spreadsheet is that the higher

365
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,740
message overhead

366
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,480
results in higher energy consumption

367
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,650
this is a very clear correlation and it

368
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,590
should doesn't come to surprise to many

369
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:58,810
so so the requirement here is the AKS

370
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,830
you have a few bytes as reasonably

371
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:04,720
possible and there was a discussion what

372
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,970
is reasonably possible this is not a

373
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,530
strict engineering requirement

374
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,700
is the clear indication that message

375
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:16,450
size matter so that's why we're focusing

376
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,760
a lot on the message sizes second

377
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,490
benchmark looked at lower warm back up

378
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,658
times so in contrast to the previous

379
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:30,010
this is unlicensed radio and therefore

380
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:33,100
there is regulations for how much you

381
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:36,360
could use a certain frequency band so

382
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,219
there you need to make it back off

383
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,908
period after transmission this is called

384
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:46,240
the duty cycle and the benchmark here is

385
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:49,210
looking at the European setting with one

386
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,860
percent duty cycle and also associated

387
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:57,780
data rates so the benchmark here is what

388
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:01,629
is the overall

389
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:05,830
wall clock completion time for a key

390
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:10,090
exchange protocol using packet size or

391
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:13,000
51 bytes which is a very common used

392
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:17,678
data rate some networks only support

393
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,720
that type of data rates and the

394
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,500
conclusion again is that there's a high

395
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:29,110
penalty for for having large messages

396
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:32,530
and this is then caused by the by a need

397
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:35,559
for fragmentation and having to wait

398
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:38,320
between these packets so the aka

399
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:43,059
should fit in us a few packets as

400
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,620
possible that's basically that's that's

401
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,620
the second requirement second benchmark

402
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:52,030
and then we have a third one which is

403
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:58,389
looking at sixty and this is similar to

404
00:29:52,030 --> 00:30:01,020
the previous so whereas in in our band

405
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,340
IOT is more like a linear function of

406
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:08,740
message size this is more like a

407
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:15,510
stepwise function where the number of

408
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:17,590
frames needed the behavior of the net

409
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,320
that's or the performance of the key

410
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:25,120
exchange so in this case we're looking

411
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,790
at a network join formation procedure

412
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,699
when many devices at the same time are

413
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:33,970
doing a key exchange protocol to connect

414
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:38,490
to a central unit and these different

415
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:40,720
devices that their protocol messages are

416
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,040
fragmented and these fragments may

417
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,550
collide with each other leading to

418
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:51,490
retransmission and causing long network

419
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:54,580
formation times so the benchmark here is

420
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:57,930
to look at the number of frames needed

421
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,189
for the key exchange message and

422
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:05,200
requirement is to make them assess as

423
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:07,630
few frames as possible and here we noted

424
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,570
when we went through the slides that

425
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:15,130
there was an error in the interim slides

426
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,740
so basically we didn't Ravello this

427
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:22,300
formula uplink down quick formula which

428
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:25,590
led to any statement about a factor 3

429
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:28,090
instead of a factor 2 point 6 between

430
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:31,600
between the different compared protocols

431
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:34,780
here so it's I mean the main conclusion

432
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,230
remains the same that 3 frames as

433
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:40,270
possible is giving this optimal

434
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:44,170
performance these numbers were taken

435
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:49,240
from a production network sixties

436
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:51,520
production network and yeah and also all

437
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,640
these rebound smart for done by by

438
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:58,600
people who are experts in these this

439
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,340
field so that comes in the last slide of

440
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:07,209
the requirements presentation and

441
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:09,010
summarizing it in aka shows support P

442
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,980
Shakira public key certificate based

443
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,860
authentication negotiation of algorithms

444
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:18,460
both of Scone AKA support the same

445
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,050
transport in Oscar and the protocol of

446
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,310
the protocol run the peer should agree

447
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:26,320
on these parameters that Oscar is using

448
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:28,280
and it shall reuse see ball co-op and

449
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,740
cozy for

450
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:36,320
loco complexity and b3 pass one one crib

451
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:40,250
a smallest reasonably achievable to fit

452
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,120
into the own pockets and 60 frames and

453
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,770
then we have this new requirement okay

454
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,110
before we start the mic line they just

455
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,900
like to remind that program out

456
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,049
clarifying questions if you think of

457
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:56,659
these requirements is bogus that's fine

458
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,500
but don't talk about this now we'll have

459
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,500
time for that later

460
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:11,230
have you considered as a requirement or

461
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,370
not a requirement the number of

462
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,140
operation sometimes that late will be

463
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,539
run on the right timing device

464
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,880
thus what sort of entropy or other

465
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:22,129
things may be hope we afford the keys

466
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,539
and they're impacting key size and the

467
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,610
rest so is this something like wife and

468
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:27,740
device that this only gets done a

469
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,389
hundred times in the lifetime device or

470
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,010
this something which no we have a

471
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,380
hundred thousand times and lifetime

472
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,030
devices becomes deformed so we have to

473
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,690
concern ourselves with this sort of

474
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,710
issue since it's again Bob asking is

475
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,720
there a different requirement or

476
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,640
clarifying thing which slide does that

477
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,530
refer to

478
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,789
and what's unclear on this slide that

479
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:51,049
you're asking about no I mean I think

480
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:52,490
it's a fine question but you know we

481
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:53,750
really want to do clarifying get the

482
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,940
other presentations on the web and have

483
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,740
the discussion David black she precious

484
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,720
first critic terrifying sector which

485
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,860
probably is our first question third

486
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,000
requirements is good amount of

487
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,990
randomness what does that mean so it is

488
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,970
something wrong with my ears that I

489
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,989
couldn't get sorry I'm a better third

490
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:15,760
third bullet says second line quote good

491
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:20,779
amount of randomness what does that mean

492
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:23,330
right so I mean people like to use the

493
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,599
word entropy but entropy has a very

494
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:30,699
precise meaning and so this this phrase

495
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,700
is actually quoted from another RFC

496
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,790
entropy Fred or George what is the

497
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,960
actual requirement that has to happen

498
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,550
so again this

499
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,099
no this is a presentation of a

500
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:51,800
performance I don't think there's a lack

501
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:55,220
of clarity here it yeah so I mean you so

502
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,080
the point is this is not saying 128 bits

503
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,770
that's not on the level is that what you

504
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,810
wanted to have no no so what I want to

505
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:09,349
understand ballpark

506
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:12,049
so suppose are we talking 128 112 96 64

507
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:14,150
32 which one of those numbers no that's

508
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,440
that's not on this level that's not on

509
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,480
this stuff that that should be I mean we

510
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,880
should be able to set that in any of

511
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,830
those are fine I mean that's that's as

512
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,500
you decide from the application point of

513
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:27,109
view and another question are you

514
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,240
assuming that the Esk is a strong secret

515
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:31,098
ie you don't have to strengthen somebody

516
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:36,410
strengthen to defend against somebody

517
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:40,640
can use the password yes okay the point

518
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:42,980
is it needs to have this is so this

519
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,759
formulation a good amount of randomness

520
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,800
is a quote from I think HKD F but it

521
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,140
might be some other coracii so and the

522
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,150
purpose of the assist is to not get into

523
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,009
this discussion but basically what we

524
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,700
are doing we take the key and then we

525
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,369
use hkpf post and expand and the other

526
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:12,859
mode and then we use it so it doesn't

527
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:26,780
have to be uniform Thanks so how much

528
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:28,640
trihard I think de crimen Smiths are the

529
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,170
privacy aspects because in the previous

530
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,299
dish comparison between ed harken and

531
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:37,339
DTLS it should be noted they're

532
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,320
providing different privacy properties

533
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:41,450
and of course they come at the cost if

534
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,880
we strip out the privacy features of TLS

535
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,529
DP less then it would reduce the size

536
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,330
but that's an important decision of

537
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,280
whether you want those or not sure

538
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,029
that's a fine comments that was not a

539
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,260
clarifying question you know

540
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:59,310
and it's not I don't think it's correct

541
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,840
so no again go on let's just let's just

542
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,610
get the clarifying question other way I

543
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:08,250
keep the discussion to later

544
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:10,740
I can't which is clarifying comments

545
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,810
only we will have a time to actually

546
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,759
provide kind of feedback so please let

547
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:18,170
us run the process so we can finish the

548
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,170
materials in the half of conversation

549
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:26,250
your name remains tight

550
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:29,130
I could we understand the background off

551
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:31,500
the street boss remark but maybe that's

552
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,590
the water but I have a more general

553
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,740
question it's a student if we really

554
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:39,360
want to design another protocol you can

555
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,709
set the problem a little bit broader if

556
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,720
you look at some of the applications

557
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,420
fences they don't just have an

558
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,810
authenticated routing protocol there

559
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,350
there are at least 50 rfcs all dealing

560
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,900
this kind of protocol variations using a

561
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:58,410
VRS

562
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,600
ki and there isn't some big selection

563
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,740
protocol at the selection process and

564
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:07,500
CFG there's some est protocols to look

565
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,859
at also more broadly at some of the

566
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,390
dates multiphonics again so my count is

567
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:34,950
that we have had zero clarifying

568
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:37,700
questions I think many things that you

569
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:41,220
can expand on in in these requirements

570
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:43,680
the problem we have in right now is that

571
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:47,459
people are deploying your score without

572
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,859
perfect forward secrecy and we think

573
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,800
that this is we need to have a fix for

574
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:56,100
that we like to be able to also use

575
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,360
public key authentication that doesn't

576
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,420
exclude that there are other ways of

577
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,099
doing this but we need to have one

578
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,749
solution

579
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,299
and not wait another three years for

580
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:12,868
this to happen so that's my high-level

581
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:14,369
answer to that so again I mean these

582
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:16,710
these questions are all welcome but they

583
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:18,630
really were in clarifying and so current

584
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,099
can be given the number of people in the

585
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,989
room her familiar of this can be speed

586
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,400
up a little bit and done on the next

587
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:27,119
presentation I mean on the next

588
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:34,950
presentation yeah sure I like taking it

589
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:36,599
right now or should I do so let's this

590
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:39,118
was intended to be an overview as well

591
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:44,190
I'm sorry for making many slides this is

592
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:46,559
an equation 13 and I just want to talk a

593
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:53,549
little bit about how it matches the

594
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:55,499
requirements and we can probably we

595
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:58,190
could probably skip a lot of this it's a

596
00:39:55,499 --> 00:40:01,288
sigma best protocol it uses Seaboard

597
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:06,569
sequences of zebra elements and cosy

598
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:09,829
constructs like encrypted sine symmetric

599
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:13,680
and asymmetric versions are very similar

600
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,819
so how is this suitable for all score we

601
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,328
have the connection identifiers

602
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:21,920
providing the Oscar sender IDs we have a

603
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:24,420
very simple negotiation of cipher suites

604
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,019
which supports negotiation alcoci

605
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,880
algorithms and we're using the same cosy

606
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,979
algorithms on my honorary distresses of

607
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,989
scoring group what score and it's a

608
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:37,739
really small footprint because it reuses

609
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:41,069
Seaborg cozy and different cause it

610
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:43,969
constructs now the constraint features

611
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:46,380
of this protocol is that it supports

612
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:51,329
it's a little bit related to Eric's

613
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:54,779
question about how we identify different

614
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:59,339
public keys so so you may be identified

615
00:40:54,779 --> 00:41:03,829
with a cozy PID or these very nice

616
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:08,249
things coming out of cozy the x5 t x5 u

617
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:10,859
XY chain and x9 park and also

618
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:13,310
certificates need not be transported in

619
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:16,910
the message

620
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:20,540
so security-wise has been special part

621
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,520
of the intro and discussion on this so I

622
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,170
think I should should leave it out but

623
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,300
it may security properties comes from

624
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,060
being Sigma I and then there are some

625
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:33,740
some other good features this has been

626
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:36,110
reviewed since 2016 but there are lately

627
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,810
more more advanced reviews there's a

628
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,880
form of verification on broker if

629
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,370
there's another one on Tamaran ongoing

630
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,380
and there were two crypto panel reviews

631
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,240
available and the latter one on them

632
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,950
provides a good overview of the protocol

633
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,979
and all of the comments have been

634
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:58,810
addressed so I just want to go to this

635
00:41:51,980 --> 00:42:04,070
is my last slide that epic actually

636
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:09,430
matches the requirements and it performs

637
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:13,160
well in these benchmarks so there are

638
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:16,580
constructed image here but these are

639
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:20,960
comparing pre-shared keys piece KD cd18

640
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:23,120
and republic is using the three

641
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,910
benchmarks b1 b2 b3 in the previous

642
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,029
presentation so first you see the number

643
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,720
b1 you see the number of bytes so taking

644
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:34,520
the PSK first b2 is a number of packets

645
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,299
that was if you remember the number of

646
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,520
of laura1 packets that you need to send

647
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:44,570
complete the protocol and that's

648
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:47,630
actually one message per packet so

649
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:51,260
that's optimal and III was the number 60

650
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:54,350
frames that you need to complete the

651
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:58,310
protocol and that's also one message per

652
00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:02,420
per frame so that was a peace k case and

653
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:08,600
for the Republic II case as you see from

654
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:12,520
the b1 column there are not alone

655
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:16,940
messages fit into packets in the frames

656
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:21,339
so we need to have multiple packets and

657
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:23,950
frames but if you compare with

658
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:28,450
taking sort of a sigma-i skeleton top at

659
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:33,489
the bottom right and you take the common

660
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:37,089
crypto objects Isis using the ephemeral

661
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:39,910
key in the signature and the Mac that's

662
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:43,119
how this is like sending only these

663
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:47,170
crypto objects in the messages you get

664
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,900
certain message sizes and if you see how

665
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:53,019
many packets of frames that correspond

666
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,499
to that those are exactly the same as we

667
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:58,749
get walk so it's in that sense optimal

668
00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:03,519
from the point of view number of number

669
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:08,218
packets in frames so that's my last

670
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,218
thought yeah that's basically it Thanks

671
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,320
[Laughter]

672
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,889
[Music]

673
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:43,660
that work yeah so I guess you know we

674
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:45,099
were asked to come and talk about some

675
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,519
multiple points in the design space so

676
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,900
here's another point of design space the

677
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,950
underlying rationale for this is like we

678
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,420
spend an enormous amount of time

679
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:57,578
developing till 2.3 like and why we see

680
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,660
enormous and implementation and you know

681
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:02,109
academic interest

682
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,029
I suppose Duff here and so here

683
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:05,859
refrigerant protocol right and so there

684
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:07,299
and we're already seeing a lot of

685
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:08,769
organizations and things they sub

686
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:10,269
sources yes and I and stuff like that

687
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:11,229
and so if we rate to be able to like

688
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:13,779
have something where you could like

689
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:15,308
leverage the ongoing work and have a

690
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:17,410
purple line of protocols it continues to

691
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:18,999
enhance as like the sort of large

692
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,969
massive work that already is going on in

693
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:24,279
TLS continues to go on but as you're on

694
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,950
some slides so it nicely showed it's not

695
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:28,269
what you'd call compact so the

696
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,549
interesting question is can you continue

697
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:32,410
to benefit from like of outline of real

698
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:33,369
all that line of work and the continuous

699
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,348
lines are proven in patch

700
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:37,450
but also have a compact protocol since

701
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:41,079
the problem like that I'm Richard and I

702
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:42,460
sorta had to walk on their truth sort of

703
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,460
two general approaches one can kind of

704
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:48,999
take here what I guess when you who call

705
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:52,239
on like cutting fat and when you could

706
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:56,109
call on compression so the cutting fat

707
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,849
one is like pretty straightforward so

708
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:59,680
keep the protocol like fill in general

709
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:01,660
but just cut like ugly encoding overhead

710
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,460
that was in the bespoke service protocol

711
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,019
on coding like no one ever borrowed

712
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,329
optimize because just was not like a

713
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:08,828
major thing as for the reference point

714
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:10,809
like if you're working on the web than

715
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:12,640
like the vast majority the data unlike

716
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,559
TLS handshakes in the web is like the

717
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,328
certificates and such nobody cares about

718
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,739
like you know an extra 20 bytes here or

719
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:21,219
there on the protocol certificate is the

720
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:22,569
big thing and especially like an quickly

721
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:24,359
you actually have to pad things out too

722
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:26,739
like if the generator 1200 bytes anyway

723
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:28,839
so there's like a lot of sort of pile of

724
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:30,210
extra stuff that like or you please

725
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:32,499
google movies bad but is there because

726
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,799
encoding so there's like a lot of places

727
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:37,359
with length fields still have like it'll

728
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:38,739
be like well here's like something which

729
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,999
is a length and then like here's the

730
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,799
length of the vector oh that's the only

731
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:44,430
thing in that thing and so wait a second

732
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,390
I could have like just figured that

733
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,219
there's a lot of places where they're

734
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,989
fixed length fields that like actually

735
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,609
have like sizes of thematically too

736
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:53,140
large for the thing that goes in them so

737
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:56,348
it's like very common to see like yeah

738
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,519
24 Whitefield for 24 a bit um you know a

739
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:59,529
length field for something like that

740
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:04,689
education never ever a larger than 35

741
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:06,039
color bytes and so if you basically you

742
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,359
can do things like go to variables

743
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:09,190
interview how much they're on coatings

744
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,630
there's once a number of places where if

745
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,670
they're like values of the basic or

746
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:15,819
implicit on some particularly redundancy

747
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:18,549
between named groups and key shares Lee

748
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:20,019
actually remove the couple places where

749
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:21,609
you can we can shorten like so

750
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:23,379
excessively one crypt of variables like

751
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:25,900
just a random value actually to be 32 I

752
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,309
guess there's like we're kind of using

753
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,150
that Frankie downgrade but if you're not

754
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:30,039
if you have system where you don't have

755
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,450
downgrade problems limit issue um so

756
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,799
effectively this gets you like at a

757
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,538
lesson point three it is like a direct

758
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:36,759
one-to-one correspondence one by three

759
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:38,349
which is like that tater encoding um you

760
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:41,549
can almost imagine like using seahorse

761
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:43,930
like that but this like watching um so

762
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:45,090
this sort of other option that we also

763
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,370
explored

764
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,620
is basically do a lot more of nailing

765
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:52,140
things down and removed appreciation for

766
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,250
things you didn't ago she ate and the

767
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,140
idea here is you probably have some

768
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,850
explosive shape parameter that said this

769
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,650
is like one of the 18 profiles that I

770
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,580
have them when you negotiate um if you

771
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,690
were that kind of stuff you can do

772
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,670
extraordinary large amounts of

773
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,290
compression basically by like we're

774
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,670
essentially saying well I don't need a

775
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:08,790
feel so I know exactly I'm doing here

776
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,570
and so if you do that then you can

777
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:13,170
actually know quite a bit more

778
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,070
compression um and there's been some

779
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,510
discussion about how do this

780
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,760
mechanically on basically two options

781
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,560
one is to treat in both these cases

782
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,820
actually one is to sort of treat the

783
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,350
wire transcript does that as the

784
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,850
transferred you sign over and the others

785
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:25,319
what we construct the original TLS 1.3

786
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,000
transcript and sign up for that so

787
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:36,900
there's advantages in both designs

788
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:38,460
that's got that largely yes depending on

789
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,790
exactly how you say how you cut things

790
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,470
up so in particular on so one thing that

791
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:45,120
you might or might not think need you to

792
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:48,240
do was not know in advance what your

793
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,319
duties or PSK so if you've got in

794
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,890
advance he wouldn't have to negotiate

795
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,000
that right um so um we've been a bunch

796
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,560
of back and forth between Richard

797
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
annoying because the bhagavad about what

798
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,570
that makes more sense to really expand

799
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,220
the transcript or not

800
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,540
the advantage of each man the transcript

801
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,040
is like then the fruits carry over as

802
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,890
long as Emma straight is amorphous on

803
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,400
the compression I've questioned their

804
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,720
cross protocol defense in that case so

805
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,060
we're working with um with Karthik and

806
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,230
and either approach of these has a

807
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,600
pretty reasonable chance to keep in the

808
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:17,220
tail 4:23 all the cellist machine

809
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,299
everyone's gone through valid which

810
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,950
Allah knows couldn't easy don't reuse

811
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,710
like all those papers that people did in

812
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:24,210
Austin protocol this is actually much is

813
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,100
it pretty straightforward for like the

814
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,140
symbolic proofs for the select the more

815
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,600
detail proofs that meet us not this is

816
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,920
harder I think this first this first

817
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,509
option I think it's pretty clear I

818
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,070
create hints that maintains the first

819
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,530
because the proofs essentially don't no

820
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:40,860
one cares about the encoding anyway but

821
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:41,880
the second one's more complicated just

822
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,220
to keeping what concrete isn't what

823
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,280
those looks like um here's an example of

824
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:51,270
the client hello so Gia's client hello

825
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,130
is like notoriously redundant so you

826
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,990
know we have this legacy aversion which

827
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,010
nobody uses with a session ID which is

828
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,200
only there for our purposes

829
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:01,330
not a lot anymore so there's a lot of

830
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,460
redundancy here also a fair amount of

831
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,500
scope for reduction here's an example I

832
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,740
was talking about with Eli fields um you

833
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,300
could have 65,000 bytes of cipher suites

834
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,009
which is roughly 32,000 cipher suites

835
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,470
I think people once thought you might

836
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:16,420
want to have so again the encodings are

837
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,279
really selectable in the sense that in

838
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,170
the sense that basically tell us to use

839
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,780
the maximum looping coding for you could

840
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:24,280
fit for the old times and so if you ever

841
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,430
run in more than a hundred twenty except

842
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:31,240
for sweet - that had to have 65 that's

843
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:32,890
pretty gross so basically you cross off

844
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,359
a lot of these things and then you can

845
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,710
also basically short and basically take

846
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,850
everything super large or shorten it and

847
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:42,340
then you get much more compressed

848
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:43,690
reputation right so this is the if you

849
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,980
basically if you read the draft like

850
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,420
basically because the document does like

851
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,300
all four kind of transformations

852
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,400
everywhere you can if you think ruby is

853
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,080
like super super hyper aggressive you

854
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,550
can do this instead a home which is

855
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,720
basically say well the entire handshake

856
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,340
shape is determined external eight and

857
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,549
i'm just cut that wire encodings

858
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:03,100
so this scott as you suggest removes

859
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:06,610
removes optionality um but um if you're

860
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,779
willing depending on depending on exact

861
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,450
environments that's a good sign as bad

862
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,680
um and so um the key point here with a

863
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,819
compression I think which is gonna make

864
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,190
this point make itself there's like a

865
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,420
sliding scale between basically having

866
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,590
full generality having that some

867
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,430
compression depending what you want with

868
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:23,860
the points get out of the compression

869
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,810
approach here if you if you do is and a

870
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,970
full transcript and use the transcript

871
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:31,480
as reinvests like the key schedule is

872
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:33,609
that even if you do use some out-of-band

873
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,360
negotiation thing to set which sectors

874
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,980
which you're using you get the

875
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,740
confirmation of those that the

876
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,450
negotiation happen properly as a results

877
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,729
the key scheduling over the expanded

878
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:46,660
transcript

879
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:48,610
sorry Richard Barnes so anyway um I

880
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,730
would say either of these um we have

881
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:53,560
like we have implementation of this

882
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:55,720
compression approach we have partial

883
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,210
mutation at the approach they're perfect

884
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,379
for is don't I convinced I can do it um

885
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,600
here are some preliminary results unlike

886
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,790
what you can get if you do this these

887
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,650
are as you can see you can more

888
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:07,870
aggressive the compression this is like

889
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,800
that's our maximum file on the first one

890
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:13,130
other ones aren't quite as aggressive

891
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:16,610
so probably the biggest major

892
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,800
contributor to the biggest sort of big

893
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,210
chunk of potential reduction here after

894
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,250
you shrink like a ppl were more

895
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,990
aggressive is the Finnish messages which

896
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,400
are super large and clear how large yep

897
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,830
to be if that's exist at all or if

898
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,250
there's a way to turn all like them so

899
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:35,029
that's a show on open research issue so

900
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:36,290
I guess as I was saying this is sort of

901
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,630
like the first cut there a number of

902
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:40,400
obvious places to remove it the next

903
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,660
steps for us are our to like again let's

904
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,970
drink to like this has lies in or is in

905
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:46,670
1 3 the key point here right is that

906
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:49,160
isn't one deal carry over 1 3 you can't

907
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,990
do that like it's not worth doing and

908
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,190
then I think we're trying to decide

909
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,839
internally whether we like this

910
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,130
compression shot is you're not it has

911
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,480
some really obvious advantages in terms

912
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,180
of being a micro really tighten the

913
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,040
screws much much harder in a particular

914
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,440
you know depending on which profile you

915
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,259
do you just like can Ruthie move run and

916
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,610
see otherwise couldn't remove um and

917
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,610
then this transfer which is she comes up

918
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:20,210
the compression experimentation here is

919
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,430
we took an existing TLS one three second

920
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:25,520
intercostal compression layers so at

921
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:28,960
least that compression around itself I

922
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,890
think one of the one of the virtues

923
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,990
eventually non-virtues depending how you

924
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,810
think about it of this is that it's

925
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:40,250
possible to design a especially possible

926
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:43,730
design essentially a gateway between a

927
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:46,460
like CTLs back in the TLS stack where

928
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:49,040
the gateway the Gateway gets the traffic

929
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,320
keys but does not get access to the the

930
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:54,890
endpoint keys if you do the compression

931
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,000
approach transcript so if you run it if

932
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,830
you sort of take the first approach

933
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,050
where you shorten Luca don't reduce read

934
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,460
the transcript right then and the

935
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,540
signatures don't work anymore and so you

936
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,430
have to have the keys for the Gateway

937
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,660
but if you if you spin the transcript by

938
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:08,680
their side then you can have a gateway

939
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,680
and you know

940
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:35,840
more compressed and even the roots have

941
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:38,480
helped to do that so actually we are in

942
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,270
a step-by-step and pls respond of sweets

943
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,010
the latest information in 3:13 is saying

944
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,750
we beat it like we spent somewhere for

945
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:46,760
compared to finding it but most that

946
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,340
effort has been directed at the biggest

947
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,070
things like certificates which are very

948
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,300
being the web context less efforts so

949
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:56,810
that for stolen spending a better than

950
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,400
the rest of it but less so I have a

951
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:01,370
clarifying question can you go back one

952
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,860
slide of course now so I'm listening :

953
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:11,390
of what's TLS 1.2 be like without either

954
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:15,230
of these I'm sorry yeah I mean

955
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:17,930
substantially worse I mean I would guess

956
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:35,390
probably like 50% larger than what what

957
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:39,529
hand call some like that message do we

958
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:42,220
really have any yeah that's probably the

959
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:46,640
thing that I think is both sketchy

960
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:48,709
yeah supportive on justice and ankles

961
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,819
that would let you put lay claim in a

962
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:54,020
purse but I think like oh yeah yeah they

963
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,040
have to like you have to commissioners

964
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,330
of that that's probably the thing I'm

965
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,779
like most resistant to pulling out

966
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:15,740
I certainly specially shrink them quite

967
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:17,690
a lot that would be I know be ideal I

968
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,919
think so so funny I mean for the non

969
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:20,480
compression strategy it's very straight

970
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,440
forward because like really there's like

971
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,030
everybody like if you do the same thing

972
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,590
there's like every right like had you

973
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,780
know to 232 I've written like V instead

974
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:31,040
so um that's pretty easy for the

975
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,180
compression thing it like demonstrated

976
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,808
but I think that probably cannot work

977
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:39,879
the ideal

978
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:42,160
maybe Jonathan has won for the first

979
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,890
strategy then yeah you could just the

980
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,038
proof is exactly the same the second

981
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,299
strategy there are like no reductions

982
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:51,880
that you can apply that mean you're

983
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:54,339
proof stoplights so I mean you might

984
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,170
have to do bit capital design but she's

985
00:56:54,339 --> 00:56:58,089
right pretty easy and we're hoping to

986
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:00,400
have is basically a lemma effectively

987
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:02,200
that you can then apply even basically

988
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,459
bolt on to any proofs and when you have

989
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,808
then when you go and you prove some

990
00:57:03,459 --> 00:57:05,919
search that you're just like well I

991
00:57:04,809 --> 00:57:09,029
applied this lemma now the whole thing

992
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,029
carry through does we're trying to get

993
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,730
[Music]

994
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,880
the proposed charter proposed so we're

995
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:27,430
just gonna pop up the proposed charter

996
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,709
and then the my clients can fly so

997
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:31,328
essentially this is I think it was said

998
00:57:29,709 --> 00:57:32,859
earlier but just reiterate this was the

999
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:34,359
output essentially of a bunch of

1000
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:37,869
discussion the sector specialist and a

1001
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:41,828
virtual interim and where that landed so

1002
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:47,589
far is a bit of text the beginning and

1003
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:51,190
to think about a working group narrowly

1004
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:55,269
focused blablabla to look at

1005
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:57,190
requirements documentos not producing

1006
00:57:55,269 --> 00:58:01,569
RFC for it which is hasn't documented

1007
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:05,199
and pick one you know not too well

1008
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:10,989
possibly zero but a zero or one a case

1009
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:12,699
and then be done so at this point I

1010
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:19,479
think we want to open the mic lines for

1011
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:23,309
whatever you want to talk about I I

1012
00:58:19,479 --> 00:58:27,339
think the focus on us for alone is is

1013
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:30,759
fetus a little bit restricted for me

1014
00:58:27,339 --> 00:58:35,078
because today the way how people deploy

1015
00:58:30,759 --> 00:58:37,779
AMD is using GLS Nicholas and I could

1016
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:40,119
imagine the work that for example a

1017
00:58:37,779 --> 00:58:43,150
capper scented with constraining that

1018
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:46,140
are making it slimmer would be perfectly

1019
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:48,660
fine for them without actually having to

1020
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:53,098
worried about Oscar in endurance

1021
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:55,410
presentation he sort of mixed the words

1022
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:58,319
between is in specifications is

1023
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:02,848
implemented in vistas is deployed in a

1024
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:05,519
in trouble creative ways in Oscar is not

1025
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:09,510
as widely deployed as as you would like

1026
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,950
so that's why I would like to have a

1027
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,690
broader focus so it has a wide

1028
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:15,450
applicability to other other

1029
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:17,250
environments not just was born and who

1030
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:27,598
knows what the next brother is going to

1031
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:30,839
be so I think this discussion is

1032
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:35,250
actually two parallel discussions so

1033
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:38,250
what what what is being done on TLS make

1034
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:40,769
me feel as more more optimal I think is

1035
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:45,420
excellent we are really happy to use

1036
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:49,200
that or for the things we have TLS but

1037
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:51,299
it's it's not providing most optimal

1038
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,419
solution for the most constrained

1039
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:56,309
settings and that I think so there is

1040
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:00,990
actually two separate questions one is

1041
00:59:56,309 --> 01:00:02,250
how do we solve the very constraints of

1042
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,140
things where we have today are using

1043
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:06,359
Oscorp where there is no key exchange

1044
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,730
protocol and where we discuss this for

1045
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:11,250
three years that's one question now the

1046
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:14,160
question is how do we make TLS in itself

1047
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:16,349
more optimal I think those are two good

1048
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,700
questions really idea and they should

1049
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:23,849
not lead to future

1050
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:25,379
I felt how they fit so one of the things

1051
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:28,950
I saw on the list that kind of like

1052
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:30,420
concerns me was statement well we're

1053
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:34,319
going to do this but we're only going to

1054
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:38,640
look at existing key exchange protocols

1055
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:42,630
and not allowing a new and then you have

1056
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,920
a new set of requirements and you know

1057
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:47,250
there's two ways you can go about

1058
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,890
something like this and the thing I've

1059
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:52,259
seen working groups do repeatedly is

1060
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:54,058
they decide ok we're going to do

1061
01:00:52,259 --> 01:00:55,680
something you need to do it fast so

1062
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:58,319
going to start from something that

1063
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,879
already exists we're not going to look

1064
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,710
at anything new whatever

1065
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,540
and we're going to adapt it and then

1066
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:06,870
they start with a set of new

1067
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:08,670
requirements and then they go straight

1068
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:11,549
into a rathole and it takes three times

1069
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:15,300
as long so it looks to me like you are

1070
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:17,540
looking at a new key exchange rather

1071
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:21,240
than complete reuse

1072
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:23,759
the other point I would make is looking

1073
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,470
at the three choices the one that I

1074
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,590
would go to without what mutating

1075
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:31,350
technology is CTLs and the reason for

1076
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:33,840
that is branding there are

1077
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:36,390
implementations where I can you know if

1078
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,880
I'm using DP if I want to use DTLS in

1079
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:42,060
the product I can usually find it in to

1080
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,680
talk it because the TLS folks said all

1081
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:47,970
right about TLS might will be out in

1082
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:51,480
DTLS I will probably get CTLs as well

1083
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:54,540
free so if you want to actually make use

1084
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:57,660
of that not you know having a similar

1085
01:01:54,540 --> 01:02:01,620
name is very useful however that will

1086
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:11,100
also apply before the deep EF or GTS as

1087
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:22,410
well what was the main net she used

1088
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:26,790
again you're off today you're not in the

1089
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:30,990
working group and so we have a see about

1090
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:32,400
what makes a successful path and so you

1091
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,930
can be a successful buff if you have

1092
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,910
agreement that there is a problem that

1093
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:39,359
needs solving and that this is the right

1094
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,560
place to solve it that we have a group

1095
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,770
of people that are willing to work on

1096
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:46,620
the problem that we understand what the

1097
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:49,940
scope of the problem is and that we

1098
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:51,720
understand what the workers will work on

1099
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:53,400
but we don't have to know what the

1100
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,910
solutions gonna look like and we don't

1101
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,280
have to work on it right here so if we

1102
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:01,259
could try a little bit to think about

1103
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,850
sort of the higher-level question your

1104
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,330
is this a problem that we want to solve

1105
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:08,520
in the ITF and do we think we understand

1106
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:10,410
the problem given the length of Mike

1107
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,759
line you know maybe having a creepy mask

1108
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,819
for just Vince it's not going to be so

1109
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,469
hard

1110
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:16,749
but let's turn to focus on do we

1111
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:19,599
understand the scope of the problem we

1112
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:22,149
had some proposed requirements that we

1113
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,680
saw you know it may be thinking about if

1114
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:26,890
that's in the right space and you know I

1115
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,239
know Bob came up to ask a completely

1116
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,769
different sort of requirement you that's

1117
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,349
a really good thing to be thinking about

1118
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:35,799
the high level is this the right problem

1119
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:37,599
to be looking at I think Phil maybe

1120
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:38,979
maybe also be as much to the point so

1121
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,319
that's the sort of points that are

1122
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:42,368
really good to be hearing about I love

1123
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:44,619
that we have people thinking about the

1124
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:45,880
technology as well if you could try to

1125
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:50,979
keep those minimum that would be

1126
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:54,670
appreciated and Benjamin Benjamin dem

1127
01:03:50,979 --> 01:03:56,499
Itron incorporated some things I've

1128
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:58,239
heard that just aren't true like but I

1129
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,038
want to kind of clarify like ioki

1130
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,559
deployments today are easy TLS I've got

1131
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:05,079
60 million gas water electric meters

1132
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,849
that aren't using TLS at all okay

1133
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:08,469
they're using proprietary supported

1134
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:11,170
protocols and we think are kind of you

1135
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:14,199
know Sigma but they're you know we can't

1136
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,069
do the proof work if we had most corn

1137
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:16,719
and maca

1138
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:20,170
12 years ago we sure would have used it

1139
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:27,069
if I had an hug year and a half ago I

1140
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:28,509
definitely would have used it there's a

1141
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:30,339
couple different reasons but guest is

1142
01:04:28,509 --> 01:04:32,259
always done - it's too heavy weight for

1143
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:35,859
various different reasons be happy to

1144
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:38,019
explain the over beer or something for

1145
01:04:35,859 --> 01:04:39,848
but really I mean for us every bit on

1146
01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:41,348
the wire and it's no there's no wire

1147
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:44,769
it's just there right but every bit

1148
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:46,539
over-the-air cost money so if the bigger

1149
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:48,249
the packets are this you know 20 more

1150
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,549
bytes to do a handshake that cost us

1151
01:04:48,249 --> 01:04:49,868
money

1152
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:51,549
that's devices you can't talk to you

1153
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:53,859
that's more time in the air that's more

1154
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:56,109
collisions in the air so it really does

1155
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:58,150
impact like this is kind of refining

1156
01:04:56,109 --> 01:05:01,420
down and and making the protocol do

1157
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:03,369
exactly what it needs to do it matters

1158
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:05,369
to us and also I just want to say like

1159
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:07,779
if there's an isomorphism of

1160
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:09,519
CTLs to kill us surely there to be an

1161
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,859
isomorphism of Ed Hocken TLS because

1162
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:19,660
after all they are all signal they are

1163
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:22,009
all along so your Sigma so I can see if

1164
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:58,790
that's probably not obvious I thought

1165
01:05:22,010 --> 01:06:29,230
I really like because very good for work

1166
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:33,170
and this work okay so this is also

1167
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:35,240
applications so one of the intended

1168
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:38,500
consequences for facially chartering

1169
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,629
this word might be to keep my pressure

1170
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:44,360
up that we actually do want to have

1171
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:48,050
something like CTLs English from from

1172
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:50,210
the TLS version as well but obviously

1173
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:52,130
CDNs has a home warranty which is the

1174
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:52,850
genus value and because there's not

1175
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:56,870
Hannibal

1176
01:06:52,850 --> 01:07:00,049
so what we're discussing today is how do

1177
01:06:56,870 --> 01:07:03,200
we create your own part and that's I

1178
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:11,690
think a pretty important intended

1179
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:13,069
consequence as well every scholar it's

1180
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:14,780
good to be the back of the mic line huh

1181
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:16,790
so I don't think it's what were

1182
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,540
discussing I've read this charter and

1183
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:21,200
I'm pretty sure it's not worth

1184
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:27,740
discussing and that's hot certainly I

1185
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:30,230
don't see it written here target good

1186
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,910
question yeah um I'm generally positive

1187
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:34,430
about this further I'm actually depicts

1188
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:39,509
which I'm happy

1189
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:43,618
should be SME more I think I do agree on

1190
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:45,570
partly with with Hana said and Iran

1191
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:46,980
certainly I think like like the penny

1192
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:49,530
people are in duo's horses better work

1193
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:53,280
with always Clerk I think it would be

1194
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:57,000
sad if it were to those core you know I

1195
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,770
guess that this year my basic premise

1196
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,810
here is that designing these things

1197
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:02,130
apart and getting a rightist part and so

1198
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:04,890
the mordrem will put the building can

1199
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:07,970
get in the more value in get better and

1200
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:12,210
so obviously the trail to but like on

1201
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:13,080
that you know I I mean obviously we have

1202
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,570
such requirements that are about

1203
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,890
performance make our midst but I don't

1204
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,299
want to do is over turbidity arrows of

1205
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,319
scope so narrowly that the NF is

1206
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:20,790
something which is a single whole thing

1207
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,350
we can't be anything else because like I

1208
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,250
just my experiences but you've got a lot

1209
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:26,910
of preparation this we have our

1210
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:29,399
communication mission is Hershey the

1211
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:31,799
other day you know I was 84 colonel and

1212
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:38,000
just watching people try to add X to 500

1213
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:40,620
lines like the and so yes it says more

1214
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,359
so funny like listen let's remember the

1215
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:45,390
generality is not about not only did

1216
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:46,650
costs us a better I don't think he does

1217
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:49,080
it can't have that but I want you to

1218
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:54,210
save people take that's good you are of

1219
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:56,519
them fill engines I mean I did not see

1220
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:58,230
you know anytime we do a protocol we

1221
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,910
have to trade off between making it more

1222
01:08:58,229 --> 01:09:01,500
and more specialized for a narrow case

1223
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:03,149
is slightly more optimal and more

1224
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,549
generalizing I don't feel it was enough

1225
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:07,200
data in any way pick between those of

1226
01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:09,689
this plan perfectly happy with a charter

1227
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,009
that sort of has us go forward thinking

1228
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:12,660
about which one's appropriate gives us

1229
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:16,189
more time to get the influent a ssin

1230
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,700
experience on how that works I

1231
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:19,108
understand you're going to say the

1232
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:22,399
trigger doesn't say that was close being

1233
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:25,470
discussed this might find so uh-huh on

1234
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:27,479
completely other comment I just was

1235
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:28,920
shocked shocked to find what an awful

1236
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:30,450
job that see a lost working group has

1237
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,310
been doing under protocol and I hope

1238
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:34,429
they get it much smaller coming really

1239
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,430
soon

1240
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:43,240
that said that um being this balance or

1241
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:44,800
trade-off between the specials and

1242
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,330
specialization and compactness is

1243
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,220
something that the working group should

1244
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:52,569
do it's not something that you deciding

1245
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:57,070
above or in the isg when crafting the

1246
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:58,660
Charter Hannes I wanted to respond to

1247
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:01,259
the question of like is this Easter

1248
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:04,680
problem is the problem to be solved and

1249
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:07,150
as you know I work for a company who

1250
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:09,640
works on the empathy l'Estaque an open

1251
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:14,920
source and very idealistic you know so

1252
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:16,990
the boys IOT devices and we don't have

1253
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,850
these problems that some of the other

1254
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:23,320
people are reporting today like we can

1255
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:25,870
run a secure IOT devices over those net

1256
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,639
those networks and other networks as

1257
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:30,610
well and we do that today

1258
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:33,850
and the primary reason is of course we

1259
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:37,030
can always cut down on things but we try

1260
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:39,130
to look at the whole bigger picture and

1261
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:40,960
the bigger picture is the whole lifetime

1262
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:43,090
of the device what does it do at the

1263
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,700
beginning of onboarding what does it do

1264
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:47,290
when it connects to the server and what

1265
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,929
does it do afterwards which is a very

1266
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:51,910
long time and it turns out that on your

1267
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:54,130
own huggies slide up and he's talked

1268
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:57,370
about 10 years lifetime from a battery

1269
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:59,650
presumably a coin cell battery and it

1270
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:00,970
turns out that many problems like heck I

1271
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:03,580
mentioned if the large certificates are

1272
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:06,220
actually else with problems that are not

1273
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:08,530
as sexy of course for IEF participants

1274
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,900
to design around this is for example the

1275
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:13,420
firmware update um what we have to cut

1276
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:15,219
down and come up with some really clever

1277
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:16,660
techniques we should shrink it down

1278
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:19,210
because that's where the battery then

1279
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:21,220
drains not because you run a once in a

1280
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:23,040
while a key exchange brother :

1281
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:26,050
in this mentioned earlier we had already

1282
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,400
extended TLS dude already from right

1283
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:29,560
from the beginning to do session

1284
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,940
resumption and different incarnations of

1285
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,040
special resumption to actually shrimp

1286
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:34,360
and shrink the things done so you don't

1287
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,000
have to exchange all the certificates

1288
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,700
and there the public the diffie-hellman

1289
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,800
body keys all the time and so that's why

1290
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,889
they don't see that those problems and

1291
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,360
and I'm happy to talk to you as far from

1292
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:48,130
icon because I talked to one of your

1293
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,610
colleagues on where I I see

1294
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:52,750
improvements in your design gas water

1295
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:58,030
metering devices

1296
01:11:52,750 --> 01:12:00,909
I mean having said that since I've been

1297
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:02,980
working on making Heelys better suited

1298
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:05,559
for a devices to shrink them down I'm

1299
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:08,799
happy to see the work that like Colin

1300
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:13,210
said to cut down on here lesson DTLS and

1301
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:15,429
I push Gurgaon and in you and many other

1302
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:17,350
Erickson colleagues would come along or

1303
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:19,060
I would have come along years ago to

1304
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:20,230
come to the DLS working group to

1305
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:21,969
actually help out with some of the

1306
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:24,820
things where I was always sitting alone

1307
01:12:21,969 --> 01:12:26,219
and talking to 50 bad people who care

1308
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:35,679
part of the different things about

1309
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:36,870
quickens on itself so yeah if I would

1310
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:41,409
Patrol

1311
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:43,929
so in my company we have developed a

1312
01:12:41,409 --> 01:12:46,089
horse-collar implementation and we are

1313
01:12:43,929 --> 01:12:48,760
interested in everyone networks which

1314
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:51,760
are very constrained for some of those

1315
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:54,489
guys it's very important to have small

1316
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,560
implementations and the possibility to

1317
01:12:54,489 --> 01:13:00,309
reuse them components that are already

1318
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,139
there for Oscar for this protocol I

1319
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:06,190
think it's something that might be very

1320
01:13:02,139 --> 01:13:09,659
helpful and this is certainly some work

1321
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:09,659
that will be very interested

1322
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:18,280
mallesh origin so speaking probably on

1323
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:19,570
behalf of the six - working group I just

1324
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,360
like to make some couple of

1325
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:24,340
clarifications we are using horse cotton

1326
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:27,820
and adopted working of documents or

1327
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:30,370
since three years now for two years ago

1328
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:33,099
we asked Rob one meeting during the

1329
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:35,500
during the premier click on the egg for

1330
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:38,350
our score so for us this was really to

1331
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:40,300
do designing an egg for our score

1332
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:42,280
satisfying these requirements that you

1333
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:44,230
are on presented and mainly the trans

1334
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:47,170
through supporting the transports that

1335
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:49,269
Oscar supports while staying efficient

1336
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:50,889
so I would just I think it's good that

1337
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:53,650
we're having this discussion today and

1338
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:57,159
that we are having opposing solutions

1339
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:59,299
but for us for us in six dish this boils

1340
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:00,799
down to the requirement

1341
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:09,620
problems cope with designing the next

1342
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:11,480
prosper yeah Eric Erickson so I think

1343
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,760
this is what should go ahead and I'd

1344
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:17,330
like to see our score and and then

1345
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:22,130
working group will move forward or okay

1346
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:25,059
and what do to movin forward and if that

1347
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:28,850
that shouldn't preclude also work on

1348
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:33,050
CTLs or DTLS developments I would like

1349
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:35,090
to see that and I just want to

1350
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:39,650
generalize my comment a little bit that

1351
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:41,330
like it it's in all the we sometimes in

1352
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:44,660
in the in the idea they are very focused

1353
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:46,940
on translators give at the end there are

1354
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,650
obviously specific security

1355
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,870
appropriately that that provide there

1356
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:53,599
are also some other situations where you

1357
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:55,970
actually need something else and it's

1358
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,680
not a one size fits all situation

1359
01:14:55,970 --> 01:15:00,680
necessarily that's probably part of the

1360
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,100
reason why we haven't always worked on

1361
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:05,600
that one Peggy TLS and so forth but

1362
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:07,430
there are other things as well and I

1363
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,000
think we're starting to see the effects

1364
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:14,540
of only focusing on one thing in the

1365
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,240
broader we also have to look at when

1366
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:19,940
psyche begins in cases across transport

1367
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:24,610
ops and so forth so that doesn't apply

1368
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:24,610
this particular work but thank you

1369
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,389
Kathleen Moriarty I am also happy to see

1370
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,889
this for some of the same reasons that

1371
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:36,920
Gary brought up I didn't know it's gonna

1372
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:41,090
say them but I'll echo the the object

1373
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:44,150
level and that distinction it's nice to

1374
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:50,810
have the combination of OS core which at

1375
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:54,799
high potential is Michael Richardson

1376
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:58,490
so I've implemented six dish brueski

1377
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:01,040
over T TLS and I could talk a lot about

1378
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:02,840
some of the interesting problems with

1379
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,460
threading models that happen with

1380
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:08,210
available libraries those are

1381
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:10,820
implementation issues but one of the

1382
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:12,770
arguments for as Phillip said you know

1383
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:14,059
about something TLS

1384
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:16,400
that you get to download the standard

1385
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:19,040
libraries that people use everywhere

1386
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:23,839
which means that you actually have the

1387
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:25,400
the advantage of an existing system the

1388
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,430
disadvantage is that you have to cope

1389
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:30,200
with the existing system okay and you

1390
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:32,300
have to figure out whether or not I am

1391
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:34,000
willing to as heinousness company has

1392
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,360
done if you rewrite it all from scratch

1393
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,370
okay

1394
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,380
or go with something else and figure out

1395
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,820
how to make it work so one of the

1396
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,260
interesting things about the way that

1397
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:44,860
people have learned co-op servers is

1398
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:47,750
that they tend to process one request

1399
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:49,219
per thread in a thread pool and this

1400
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,290
totally doesn't work as soon as you put

1401
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,850
a security context around it now it

1402
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:55,040
probably doesn't work regardless of

1403
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:58,700
whether the security context above co-op

1404
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,110
or below that just to be clear but the

1405
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:02,150
current set of libraries that we have

1406
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:04,880
forces you to do it in a particular way

1407
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:08,059
so that's something I want to say that

1408
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:12,430
that in the space of co-op asks which is

1409
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:16,160
co-op over DTLS we have within that a

1410
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:18,740
nother layer of OS core once you get

1411
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:21,920
things going okay

1412
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:25,670
whereas what we're trying to do is

1413
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:29,300
actually key OS core we don't actually

1414
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:33,320
want to run co-op over a DTLS we want to

1415
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:35,570
key OS core and then just run let co-op

1416
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:38,269
run okay and that's why we get the

1417
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:40,070
transport agility okay through other

1418
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:41,510
things and possibly through several

1419
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:43,309
layers and I think that's something

1420
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:45,320
that's not captured in the chart I don't

1421
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:46,640
have a specific suggestion but I don't

1422
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:52,250
think that's captured in the Charter

1423
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:54,470
okay and I have see CTLs I would love to

1424
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:57,800
I would prefer that over in their co-op

1425
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:59,720
est spec I would prefer that we just

1426
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,300
went with that like tomorrow make it C

1427
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:04,790
work please and let's just use that

1428
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:06,050
that'll be great but for those things

1429
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:09,290
that want to go through several devices

1430
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:10,790
and do things I'm not sure that works

1431
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:13,630
and I think we need something else and

1432
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:16,040
so please let's do this all right

1433
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:17,510
so jump in this is done kitty I just

1434
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,880
want to clarify one point that Michael

1435
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:21,650
was making arcs I'm not clear about it

1436
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,850
and I think it's important so you said

1437
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:26,820
that right now in the stuff with you

1438
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:29,700
menteng you do DTLS and you run co-op

1439
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:31,700
mouse over that and within the co-op

1440
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:36,480
apps you're carrying OS core messages

1441
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:39,090
that correct and so what you would like

1442
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:42,059
to be doing instead is to not have the

1443
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:44,940
DTLS layer and to say we're gonna run a

1444
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:48,780
lightweight we're gonna key or a support

1445
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:51,389
directly and just be sending you saying

1446
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:55,610
go escort over the wire or go out

1447
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:55,610
without the coop that's the other detail

1448
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:01,170
okay so you're an effect c game core

1449
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:02,880
we're removing a layer from your entire

1450
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:07,760
encoding for the bulk data transfer

1451
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,760
correct yes that's exactly correct

1452
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:18,599
justin richer and yeah definitely not

1453
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:20,790
picking sides but I just wanted but I

1454
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,560
just wanted to I wanted to point out an

1455
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:24,300
observation somebody who's really only

1456
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,460
been following this work from several re

1457
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,020
distances away and that's that I've

1458
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:31,290
heard a lot of people come up to the mic

1459
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:33,120
and say oh it's easy because we have

1460
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:35,880
this other similar thing that we've done

1461
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,849
that if you just change everything about

1462
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,700
it it'll totally be this new thing and

1463
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:51,500
isn't that simple

1464
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:55,950
and I think that that's paraphrasing but

1465
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:59,400
all I want to do is encourage the

1466
01:19:55,950 --> 01:20:00,660
working group to approach such claims

1467
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,540
with the appropriate amount of

1468
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:08,460
skepticism because if you're going to be

1469
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:10,410
altering existing systems in order to

1470
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:12,900
fit new use cases you're going to be

1471
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:16,559
twisting them in ways that are really

1472
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:21,320
difficult to predict and the details can

1473
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:24,720
really end up killing you there so I

1474
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:28,590
just wanted to say that anybody who

1475
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:32,310
claims that you know and I heard this

1476
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:34,170
from from multiple people with multiple

1477
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:35,960
backing multiple different technologies

1478
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:40,190
going into this make

1479
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:42,590
similar claims today that if somebody is

1480
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:44,360
telling you oh yeah we we just changed

1481
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:47,740
everything and it works fine on our

1482
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:52,870
little bespoke box that's not gonna

1483
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:52,870
scale as well as maybe you might think I

1484
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:59,480
would do I would like to this kind of

1485
01:20:56,930 --> 01:21:06,830
like to follow up on but Michael said

1486
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:10,269
previously and it it sounds like an easy

1487
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:13,730
thing to just we implement these

1488
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:15,050
and just do something else and create

1489
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:17,389
something new from scratch on and be

1490
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:19,100
done with it but probably Brandon -

1491
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:21,770
that's why we have a team of getting

1492
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:24,080
Plus people are working more than 10

1493
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:26,930
years for this is because the innovative

1494
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,700
its face is somewhat hard there's lots

1495
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:31,160
of different hardware there are lots of

1496
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:33,080
different operating systems built them

1497
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:34,880
operating systems some people rare a

1498
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:37,160
trauma clear metal and then you have to

1499
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,440
integrate it into into the IDS as well

1500
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:41,840
to make the experience a little bit

1501
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:45,500
smoother and that takes a lot of time

1502
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:48,550
and I'm curious on who is essentially

1503
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:52,370
writing this new embedded security stack

1504
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:54,110
for at work and in maintain it for then

1505
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:55,760
something years coming before it a

1506
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:57,740
feature that will come along integration

1507
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,390
of hardware secure things on I think

1508
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,610
people underestimate the bring the

1509
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:04,130
effort what looks like a hackathon

1510
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:06,200
project a one-off thing is actually much

1511
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:08,990
more working I was astonished myself

1512
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,700
when I saw it it looks like implementing

1513
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:12,559
some of the extensions that come out of

1514
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:14,809
the pls working is so easy but if you

1515
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,690
have to make it work for many many

1516
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:21,350
different devices it's difficult I'm

1517
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:23,410
just it's not a joke I'm not making

1518
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:25,850
yourself you look at the look at our

1519
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:28,940
verbosity and how many contributors down

1520
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:34,910
on how many Hardware black homies runs

1521
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:36,559
it's good Richard burns again I just

1522
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:39,710
want to clarify when did I heard a

1523
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,150
couple of people raise an idea that you

1524
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:44,240
know CTO of this district could do

1525
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:46,700
things he could progress a lot on TLC's

1526
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:49,119
I don't really think that CTO is

1527
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:51,719
actually makes sense as a TLS work right

1528
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:54,869
because if you were going to design a

1529
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:57,939
compactive compactify to compress 402 us

1530
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:59,558
you have these questions of when you

1531
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:02,019
have these questions of the trade-offs

1532
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:03,610
between rigidity and size that you want

1533
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:06,669
to negotiate what impact that you want

1534
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:08,139
input from the community of IOT users to

1535
01:23:06,669 --> 01:23:11,320
figure out where in that traits gates

1536
01:23:08,139 --> 01:23:17,590
are going to be and I have a second

1537
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:19,329
point and similarly you the structure of

1538
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:21,909
the compactive education depends very

1539
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:23,648
much on the environment in which is

1540
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:26,079
going to use I think yes CTLs is going

1541
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:27,369
to be done again not saying that it

1542
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:28,599
needs to be the outcome here but if it's

1543
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:31,749
gonna be done I think it needs to be

1544
01:23:28,599 --> 01:23:33,820
done in a context that has all the

1545
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:36,239
context we're talking about today not

1546
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:36,239
just as accurate

1547
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:42,729
Dave you are from Intel I just want to

1548
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:46,719
reiterate something that I heard a

1549
01:23:42,729 --> 01:23:48,699
couple people say is the presentation

1550
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,919
today in the work charter kind of seems

1551
01:23:48,699 --> 01:23:52,989
like we're gonna take something and just

1552
01:23:50,919 --> 01:23:55,090
make a few tweaks to it to make it

1553
01:23:52,989 --> 01:23:56,379
something completely different and it's

1554
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:59,289
all going to be fine and we don't even

1555
01:23:56,379 --> 01:24:00,939
need an RFC and we'll do this quick and

1556
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:04,570
it kind of scares me maybe I just

1557
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:07,899
understand what's going on with the

1558
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:10,629
intended work but it seems to me from my

1559
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:13,559
perspective is that we need a different

1560
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:16,269
Keen protocol and we should address that

1561
01:24:13,559 --> 01:24:19,899
appropriately with the right amount of

1562
01:24:16,269 --> 01:24:21,610
resources coming in I get a little

1563
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:24,849
nervous about saying oh we're just gonna

1564
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:26,499
change a little bit feet TLS it'll be

1565
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:28,959
awful so just to kind of at the point

1566
01:24:26,499 --> 01:24:30,519
about the bit that's not an RFC would be

1567
01:24:28,959 --> 01:24:32,499
just a requirements document there's a

1568
01:24:30,519 --> 01:24:34,989
there's a history in the IETF of people

1569
01:24:32,499 --> 01:24:36,999
writing requirements documents and then

1570
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:38,348
everybody's so bored with them but by

1571
01:24:36,999 --> 01:24:40,329
the time you get to try and turn in

1572
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:42,760
tomorrow see it just turns into a crap

1573
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:44,799
fest so that it's it's the idea here

1574
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:47,829
that it in the Charter draft Charter is

1575
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,899
to document and agree the requirements

1576
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:52,869
in a working group but don't make that

1577
01:24:49,899 --> 01:24:54,939
talk to me tomorrow see but the protocol

1578
01:24:52,869 --> 01:24:59,409
itself yes would be processed as usual

1579
01:24:54,939 --> 01:25:01,809
and become an RFC okay thanks just to

1580
01:24:59,409 --> 01:25:02,679
clarify my earlier remarks I was not

1581
01:25:01,809 --> 01:25:04,930
suggesting doing

1582
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:07,600
TLS this needs to be in that separate

1583
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:10,210
working group and with all the will in

1584
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:14,080
the world yes we can try it hope to

1585
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:16,180
reuse troops and so on but you know at

1586
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,080
the end of the day their victim more or

1587
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:19,090
less free

1588
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:31,269
they've got infinite numbers of grad

1589
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:33,190
students that's not suppose I have you

1590
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:45,460
know I another I'll have you know I'm

1591
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:48,669
not free I'm very expensive TMS solo

1592
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:50,500
start making CTLs I think the correct

1593
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:54,370
solution is to makes static header per

1594
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:56,140
person rules for TLS with this you know

1595
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:57,790
way that you say that okay it with each

1596
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:00,100
frame starts with universal number

1597
01:25:57,790 --> 01:26:02,410
treatment oh we compress it by omitting

1598
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:04,060
completely on the other end when we've

1599
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:06,099
received the frame we see that okay we

1600
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:08,500
know that the first bytes are you know

1601
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:12,580
person up for treatment or sure it's 2 1

1602
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:14,710
4 3 Rd X money there and in this way you

1603
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:17,080
can always you know compress the frame

1604
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:18,970
with the static header of there if if we

1605
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:20,200
ever come you know meet some extensions

1606
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:22,180
or something like that we can create a

1607
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,530
new study cater conferencing tools for

1608
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:25,600
that extension of that something like

1609
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:29,200
that and this would allow complete you

1610
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:31,420
know taking the existing 103 TLS praying

1611
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:34,420
conversing down with the cicada

1612
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:36,400
proposition and sending it out with only

1613
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:38,800
minimal stuff that we need and then

1614
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:41,500
another expand it back and pick up at

1615
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,960
there'll be no modified TLS at all WB

1616
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:47,830
modify with is this hello sorry kind of

1617
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:50,770
cumbersome rules we need I'll be looking

1618
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:55,690
for your help with that I actually just

1619
01:26:50,770 --> 01:27:12,760
got up to a beautiful sailing on the the

1620
01:26:55,690 --> 01:27:14,599
academics are offering I think are so

1621
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,130
long you know they just

1622
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,990
say in Hebrew for anything but like it's

1623
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,120
like not like like this guys work really

1624
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:22,330
more I might get in I got up at your

1625
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,330
casa

1626
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:30,950
that's the 2.0 RT risk first of all I

1627
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:33,170
think that the work that will be city

1628
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:35,030
lights at some point actually does need

1629
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:37,790
some water resources so for the people

1630
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:42,019
who were in the TLS were a group rent

1631
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:46,160
that meets them more urgently than the

1632
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:48,560
resources that constraint people really

1633
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:50,930
have this wonderful and it's a huge at

1634
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,480
some point and then they can just commit

1635
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:57,500
against that but I think that how things

1636
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:59,059
are actually touching TLS and doing this

1637
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:03,140
in a way that that it doesn't break it

1638
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:07,970
now I have a draft from 2013 that

1639
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:11,060
describes how to hit a compress DTLS so

1640
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:14,720
that's not that hard at this period of

1641
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:18,770
mine wrote that most of it the problem

1642
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:21,560
of course is that the way fearless is

1643
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:23,270
defined there is there are these

1644
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,510
wonderful finished messages and they

1645
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:29,090
work on what was on the wire

1646
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:31,970
and if you compress it it's not the same

1647
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:34,850
thing so you actually have to construct

1648
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:36,950
the entirety of the messages in memory

1649
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:38,090
before you you are able to construct

1650
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:41,330
that fresh message

1651
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:44,690
so thinking about the finished message

1652
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:46,820
is probably the most important new thing

1653
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:49,849
I'm taking over from the discussion yeah

1654
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:51,559
this is really useful thing that I would

1655
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:58,070
like to understand better what we can do

1656
01:28:51,560 --> 01:29:00,760
there in converting those few points it

1657
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:03,500
yeah ackerson's interesting you say that

1658
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,960
relative importance of the two sides of

1659
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,790
this relationship because I think it's

1660
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:11,060
not like the things you are least mayor

1661
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:13,340
would seem the hardest so like coming

1662
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:15,080
from a TLS back on the IOT that doesn't

1663
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:18,470
seem harder to me it's living it until

1664
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:20,300
it's consumer yeah I remember the second

1665
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:21,260
thing that we would need out of this

1666
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:23,270
community if you were gonna do a

1667
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:27,440
protocol like this which is you know

1668
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:29,300
Collins this a ke what kind of

1669
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:31,250
integration services it need to exposed

1670
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:35,719
to fit in with us Lauren Collins that

1671
01:29:31,250 --> 01:30:26,989
integration work and I think that would

1672
01:29:35,719 --> 01:30:29,659
be good to get into this so it seems

1673
01:30:26,989 --> 01:30:31,309
like from reading the this and from the

1674
01:30:29,659 --> 01:30:33,500
discussion today there's an implicit

1675
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:35,360
shared notion of what all the costs are

1676
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:36,800
and I think it's totally reasonable for

1677
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,120
everyone this think well what bites on

1678
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,590
the wire are extremely expensive because

1679
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:43,010
indeed it's very expensive to some

1680
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:45,230
things over wireless like on the other

1681
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:47,300
hand it may be the case that like it

1682
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:49,699
would be useful to make explicit the

1683
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:52,040
suppose it costs so it may be that they

1684
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:54,019
would be useful to have multiple models

1685
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:55,489
you know so the cost is this for this

1686
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:57,500
this sort of thing because it might be

1687
01:30:55,489 --> 01:31:00,530
that at the end for example you want to

1688
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:02,480
really crush the cost of crypto and so

1689
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:04,940
it doesn't make any sense as very

1690
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:07,099
specific example to use hkpf with a

1691
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:09,259
sponge fashion maybe you could say a

1692
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:10,940
little bit of the work there and I don't

1693
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,770
know but it may be the case that some

1694
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:16,219
people in this room would really care

1695
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:18,710
about making that better so it might be

1696
01:31:16,219 --> 01:31:22,730
like as a next step as part of number

1697
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:24,380
one a useful thing to specify in some

1698
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:26,839
reasonable detail what the assumptions

1699
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:28,070
are about costs of various things

1700
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,330
because if the only thing you care about

1701
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:31,159
is saving bytes on the wire that it

1702
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:34,400
seems totally reasonable to compress TLS

1703
01:31:31,159 --> 01:31:35,330
and call like done but it may be that

1704
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,710
that's not what you care about and

1705
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:40,390
therefore that might not end up being

1706
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:42,720
the correct thing big

1707
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:45,490
but right from the buyer just easier to

1708
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:49,270
put together they've become the

1709
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:50,740
measuring power consumption but someone

1710
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:52,330
previously mentioned it it is and I was

1711
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,830
wondering whether that's actually cope

1712
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:57,460
for this Cooper spoil because there's a

1713
01:31:53,830 --> 01:32:01,809
separate document that Owen and I

1714
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:06,610
together based on a Cisco and and we

1715
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:09,040
have products are not space so it wasn't

1716
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:12,130
written with this specific goal in mind

1717
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:18,400
but since was brought up I think it can

1718
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:21,720
make sense been Caidic stopping back

1719
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:24,580
into check by with the valve questions

1720
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:27,970
we do have almost like I'm really happy

1721
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:30,280
to hear you know the interests people

1722
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:32,320
have and support forward in space I

1723
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:35,380
think you know the critical mass of

1724
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:36,990
people is pretty good at control we're

1725
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:40,000
talking about the problem which is good

1726
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:41,500
I'm actually really excited to see the

1727
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,390
discussion about the scope of the

1728
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:45,700
problem so we had several people come up

1729
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:47,350
and give some things that we might want

1730
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:49,900
to think about for the requirements

1731
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:52,750
document that we're not mentioned in the

1732
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:54,370
slides you're like I was mentioning the

1733
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:55,870
number of aches we're actually gonna do

1734
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,220
over the timescale on the device you

1735
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:59,440
know how important that stuff for the

1736
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:01,810
battery life how are we can integrate

1737
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,690
with those for that I think Richards

1738
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:06,940
imagining as I think that the TLS

1739
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:08,769
experts would not be able to do how a

1740
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:13,330
generic how specific do we need to be

1741
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:15,760
how how tightly coupled do the

1742
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:17,380
requirements that we come up with or arm

1743
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,180
its document need to be with the use

1744
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:22,900
cases that we are currently looking at

1745
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:25,930
how extensible or flexible do we want to

1746
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:27,129
do if you use cases the immediately

1747
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:29,110
previous speaker I think was talking

1748
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:32,770
about what are the assumptions about

1749
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:33,940
costs that we're making we probably want

1750
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:35,320
to write those down there's maybe the

1751
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:37,000
great thing I'm really happy to do this

1752
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,759
so thank you everybody for the good

1753
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,780
discussion I'm in step away from my

1754
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,780
company we can keep going

1755
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:54,360
so a couple of things if I can remember

1756
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:57,310
starting with this point on assumptions

1757
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:59,200
costs but that's basically what we've

1758
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:02,680
been doing in the safety scratch work

1759
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:06,070
with the benchmarks and it turns out

1760
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:09,880
that this is not so easy to get all the

1761
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:12,309
cost exactly right so you need to make

1762
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,650
assumptions and weighting in order to

1763
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:17,860
make a hard measurement about saying

1764
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:20,110
this is a good property and then you

1765
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:27,670
need to make assumptions and that those

1766
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:29,230
assumptions are based on something so

1767
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:31,300
it's not I don't think it's very easy to

1768
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:33,849
produce this excellent requirements

1769
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:36,280
document here and I think that's good

1770
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:42,520
with the Charter that says that it's not

1771
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:46,929
intended to be an RFC then coming back

1772
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:51,330
to the solution space I think it's

1773
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:57,580
important here to understand it's that

1774
01:34:51,330 --> 01:35:00,250
the optimal solution probably isn't CTLs

1775
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:05,350
in the it is not in the most compact and

1776
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:07,810
aggressive as we've seen here I mean

1777
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:12,880
that's definitely not as lightweight as

1778
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:14,530
as they the protocol I was showing so at

1779
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,110
some point we need to make the choice

1780
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:19,380
are we going to do an isomer field of

1781
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:25,679
TLS are we going to do an optimal

1782
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:25,680
solution so the people are not sort of

1783
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:30,870
tricky to think that this will be both

1784
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:33,700
because it won't be dance I'm afraid

1785
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:35,140
that this is as far as I mean I think

1786
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:37,960
you'd already done a lot of joking

1787
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:39,670
fighting with us I some morphine and I

1788
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:47,350
have a hard time seeing that you will

1789
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:49,240
get down to levels sorry I'm not saying

1790
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:51,400
that this won't happen but as far as I

1791
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:53,290
can see so the question is what with

1792
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:57,579
what we do then if we come to the

1793
01:35:53,290 --> 01:36:02,379
question that is not optimal okay

1794
01:35:57,579 --> 01:36:05,648
things like I'm Mikey Benedict so in

1795
01:36:02,379 --> 01:36:07,719
light of what urine just said I think we

1796
01:36:05,649 --> 01:36:09,550
do have some text in the draft charter

1797
01:36:07,719 --> 01:36:14,949
draft charter that's up on the screen

1798
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:16,869
about that most one like that is a draft

1799
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:19,299
text in charter we can talk about that

1800
01:36:16,869 --> 01:36:23,739
that's right you do I don't know if it

1801
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:25,599
is at home but actually I mean I heard a

1802
01:36:23,739 --> 01:36:27,608
question that hasn't Corp so far so I'm

1803
01:36:25,599 --> 01:36:29,139
gonna bring it up we have a bunch of

1804
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:32,249
very smart people in the room we have

1805
01:36:29,139 --> 01:36:34,719
two possible candidates choices and

1806
01:36:32,249 --> 01:36:36,489
requirements discussion in the IETF that

1807
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:42,129
can turn into like three years of just

1808
01:36:36,489 --> 01:36:43,509
squabbling it's not clear to me how and

1809
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:45,639
whether it is anything we could put in

1810
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:47,649
the Charter that would help and would be

1811
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:49,869
great if there is but how does that

1812
01:36:47,649 --> 01:36:51,489
requirements discussion terminate to

1813
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:54,549
allow the second part of the work to

1814
01:36:51,489 --> 01:36:55,780
continue is not clear to me and if

1815
01:36:54,550 --> 01:37:00,909
people have thoughts on that I think it

1816
01:36:55,780 --> 01:37:04,539
would be interesting I'm just the

1817
01:37:00,909 --> 01:37:07,539
questions that Ben's repeating a couple

1818
01:37:04,539 --> 01:37:09,879
times I think most the question is

1819
01:37:07,539 --> 01:37:12,219
thinking I'm convinced that the answer

1820
01:37:09,879 --> 01:37:13,719
to most the questions is yes I think the

1821
01:37:12,219 --> 01:37:16,239
most interesting part of the discussion

1822
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:19,030
is about the scope okay and so for

1823
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:21,518
example if you just look at the Texas on

1824
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:24,849
the screen all the text it's under

1825
01:37:21,519 --> 01:37:27,699
program of work and even that text it's

1826
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:30,729
under goals as all just talking about

1827
01:37:27,699 --> 01:37:33,909
constrained environments it's not

1828
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:34,800
talking about either Oz core or object

1829
01:37:33,909 --> 01:37:36,848
level security

1830
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,789
although stuff in the problem statement

1831
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:42,669
as abroad as core and object level

1832
01:37:39,789 --> 01:37:45,369
security and so the question is are we

1833
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:49,869
solving the problem or is meaning is the

1834
01:37:45,369 --> 01:37:52,629
problem too narrowly described or is the

1835
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:53,829
program of work too broad and I think

1836
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:55,389
that's the question that funnest was

1837
01:37:53,829 --> 01:37:57,039
asking and that's right here at which

1838
01:37:55,389 --> 01:37:59,530
people at the mic talking about so far I

1839
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:02,259
have heard a bunch of support and minds

1840
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:04,898
and from what I've heard for solving

1841
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:06,069
something with it özgür and if it can be

1842
01:38:04,899 --> 01:38:08,589
used with other stuff too that's great

1843
01:38:06,069 --> 01:38:11,170
right but the current demand was us for

1844
01:38:08,589 --> 01:38:12,670
that tells me that

1845
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:14,980
one statement is probably good enough

1846
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:20,739
and maybe the program of work should be

1847
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:22,059
wordsmith a little bit pretty say

1848
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:23,739
greatest I have the opposite

1849
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:26,770
interpretation of that I mean which is

1850
01:38:23,739 --> 01:38:28,239
sure which I think her work is roughly

1851
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:28,660
right and the problem state was tiny bit

1852
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,580
too narrow

1853
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:31,540
I don't call them so in the problem

1854
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:34,949
statement I just think something the

1855
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:34,949
only involved even with lead assess

1856
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:42,420
three years this is fun of setting

1857
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:45,400
another facet to this problem statement

1858
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:47,020
and cuz he mentioned that she would like

1859
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,210
to see something on object level

1860
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:52,150
security and funny enough Oscar doesn't

1861
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:54,480
to object level security in the adls

1862
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:57,070
document that I mentioned earlier I

1863
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:00,489
described or we described how to derive

1864
01:38:57,070 --> 01:39:02,679
keys from cozy which provides object

1865
01:39:00,489 --> 01:39:04,629
ever security and I think that would

1866
01:39:02,679 --> 01:39:07,000
also be very useful because we have a

1867
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:09,060
number like in suit we have a number of

1868
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,410
cases where we actually want to protect

1869
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:14,230
individual bailouts and we may also need

1870
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:17,949
a key management protocol for them and I

1871
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:20,830
think that's good it's someone said

1872
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:23,410
earlier they wanted to add this or point

1873
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:26,590
out that authorized protocol agnostic

1874
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:28,030
and that's all also only partially true

1875
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:30,460
I think there's a little bit of over

1876
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:33,130
advertisement here because it's true

1877
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:34,929
when the stuff that comes in and the

1878
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:36,550
stuff goes out actually is the rest

1879
01:39:34,929 --> 01:39:39,910
protocol and has the same protocol

1880
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:41,620
semantics and we talked about the Itron

1881
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:44,349
case previously you are protocol you're

1882
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:48,820
probably using is not what is probably

1883
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:51,699
not most of the guys going on use MQTT

1884
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:55,719
like Amazon Google Microsoft not a

1885
01:39:51,699 --> 01:39:57,730
restful protocol just to give you a sort

1886
01:39:55,719 --> 01:40:00,280
of like an illustration of like how easy

1887
01:39:57,730 --> 01:40:06,639
that fits into like this idea of being

1888
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:09,790
provoked or agnostic Theodoric Stephens

1889
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:13,360
comment about competing protocols taking

1890
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:15,670
forever reminds me of my experience I am

1891
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:18,910
one of the chairs who survived the

1892
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:21,520
long-running TCP Inc working group which

1893
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:23,050
might have been what he had and so let

1894
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:25,720
me offer one thing

1895
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:28,120
concrete piece of advice base what

1896
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:30,880
happened a TCP Inc it would be

1897
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:33,220
irresponsible the iesg to charter

1898
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:47,890
working group here without picking the

1899
01:40:33,220 --> 01:41:05,200
core protocols start from so I see an

1900
01:40:47,890 --> 01:41:07,240
agreement and disagreement so responsive

1901
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,099
harnesses comma which is my thing is you

1902
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:11,200
make tough decisions no I am saying that

1903
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,970
when me ie when the Charter comes out

1904
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,400
the toughness is just happy me I don't

1905
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:17,530
care by whom I don't care by how but

1906
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:19,269
they must be made though otherwise those

1907
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:25,120
who fail to learn history will be

1908
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:27,460
condemned repeating yourself working if

1909
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:30,430
the requirements aren't final how can we

1910
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:34,200
ever decide between the options one of

1911
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:34,200
them might not cover the requirements

1912
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:41,769
someone asked you a question how do you

1913
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:43,240
think that the the point at which the

1914
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:46,920
decision is make will shorten the amount

1915
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,920
of time it takes to make the decision I

1916
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:57,160
am hoping that we can find a way not to

1917
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:59,950
spend two years debating a working group

1918
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:01,870
chart there is a procedural limit to the

1919
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:03,760
number of boss you're allowed to have

1920
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:05,790
that ought to serve as a forcing

1921
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,790
function

1922
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:20,000
so your point being that this process

1923
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:23,120
will timeout if there's no decision and

1924
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,500
that's a better results than chartering

1925
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,790
a working group and having the process

1926
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:31,730
go for a long time and then making a

1927
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:33,320
decision tree guard two years of a

1928
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:35,959
working group trying to make a decision

1929
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:39,519
eventually doesn't get made in a timely

1930
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:39,520
fashion as it could use the IT resources

1931
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:50,470
customer when I've been doing a lot of

1932
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:53,929
stimulation in diastole stage use

1933
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:56,240
requirements a lot and there's something

1934
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:59,000
called requirements engineering that may

1935
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:01,639
not be way off requirements engineering

1936
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,010
is engineering the requirements in such

1937
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:08,210
a way that your solution comes out as

1938
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:10,940
the one that is chosen and so work on

1939
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:14,210
the requirements always is tainted by

1940
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:17,179
this problem and we shouldn't be

1941
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:19,520
spending a lot of time honing this these

1942
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:22,840
requirements knowing that there's just

1943
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,740
energy that is dissipated from from

1944
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:29,080
actually doing the work

1945
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:29,080
having somebody about the wires is good

1946
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:35,840
but this is not something that we should

1947
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:37,850
spend a lot of time so I think that by

1948
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,230
the time the requirements are finished

1949
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:43,760
and that's something that we want to

1950
01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:45,709
work in work to do and either one of the

1951
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,780
proposals doesn't meet the requirements

1952
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:49,670
and then it's off the table anyway or

1953
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:54,349
both meet the requirements and then we

1954
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:58,360
could decide by quintus if there's no

1955
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:58,360
clear majority in the room for one

1956
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:09,230
that's how we decide things the web RTC

1957
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:10,910
group had a much more difficult decision

1958
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:13,639
about this about a video codec to use

1959
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,800
and there was no way though I understand

1960
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:17,720
the pain of the TCPA working group you

1961
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:20,420
know I get the point

1962
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:22,760
um we would never have managed to come

1963
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,450
to a decision on that topic had we not

1964
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,820
had

1965
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:28,040
awfully 4 years of repeated discussion

1966
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:29,210
about it in working group meetings and

1967
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,560
we came to a solution that was pretty

1968
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:32,480
good and I believe that we would never

1969
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,490
charge WebRTC if we decided we would

1970
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:44,120
have had to make that decision before we

1971
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:47,150
charter so we're spending four years

1972
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:49,640
more to try to find finding some

1973
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:53,030
solution maybe we didn't manage and

1974
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:56,960
maybe a lot of applications are being

1975
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:58,219
used without forward secrecy and we

1976
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,200
don't have a good key management

1977
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:02,810
protocol for school I don't think that's

1978
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:05,690
a very good solution but I mean we

1979
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:09,700
basically came to this room to try to

1980
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:13,309
find a solution for all score that's

1981
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:16,700
something that we can work on in

1982
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:19,610
parallel with optimizing TLS I don't see

1983
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:22,849
that I am currently I don't see that

1984
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:25,580
they are the same solutions they may be

1985
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:28,100
but I have a difficulty seeing that

1986
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:30,730
moment but I also don't see the problem

1987
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:34,610
having multiple solutions in this face

1988
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:35,980
that's one comment about the second I

1989
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:38,780
[Music]

1990
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:42,620
just want to push back on the idea that

1991
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:45,620
picking one protocol is necessarily

1992
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:49,130
going to speed things up because my

1993
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:51,980
experience is that when you when you

1994
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:53,870
come in and you start from a particular

1995
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:56,419
starting point they said we're gonna

1996
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:58,610
pick this winner but we've got all these

1997
01:45:56,420 --> 01:46:02,720
other requirements and so we're going to

1998
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:05,000
start changing it it's cuz it's like if

1999
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:07,340
you start off from the idea well we want

2000
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,430
a house but we're going to remodel it

2001
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:13,610
and then there is a certain point way

2002
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:16,040
seems like the easiest thing to do is to

2003
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:17,929
start from a house and just remodel and

2004
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:21,160
you know replace things but you know

2005
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:24,410
after I had replaced my roof my walls my

2006
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:29,540
foundation and so I've actually rebuild

2007
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:31,730
my house now twice and you know I've

2008
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:32,960
seen this happening working groups you

2009
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:34,790
know I've been in working groups where

2010
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,390
people have said in the chartering

2011
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:38,420
discussion

2012
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:40,550
we have to have this done in a year so

2013
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:44,170
there's no time to think about it we

2014
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:48,530
must do it now and five years later

2015
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:50,780
they're still at it and this working

2016
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:53,630
group has failed because they chose the

2017
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:56,809
wrong protocol to try and do it fast

2018
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:58,190
so I don't think that there's a sounds

2019
01:46:56,810 --> 01:47:06,320
like it's going to be shortcut but my

2020
01:46:58,190 --> 01:47:11,629
experience is that it isn't so this

2021
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:13,160
meeting ends in 13 minutes I don't think

2022
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:17,810
a realistic way to run a beauty contest

2023
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:23,059
in 13 minutes so I guess I would focus

2024
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:25,430
on how we actually it seems to be that

2025
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:26,830
we can they're number options or news we

2026
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:30,740
could all go home

2027
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:32,780
that's possibility one is we can

2028
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:34,160
schedule some other kind of meeting is

2029
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:37,099
attempted to resolve the question before

2030
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:38,720
the starting point is your meeting there

2031
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:42,380
it is actually from the one you wish

2032
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:44,480
this Charter the second choosing or some

2033
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:47,330
other day I think is the point I was

2034
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:48,759
making as you can see I'm deliberately

2035
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:53,570
avoiding the merits this conversation

2036
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:55,100
I'm happy engagements um but I I guess

2037
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:57,880
I'd like to focus on how we actually

2038
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,880
support progress

2039
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:07,400
Benjamin dynamite Ron so yeah seems like

2040
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:10,880
there's a there's an audience problem

2041
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:14,990
that's happening which is like HTTP is

2042
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:17,630
not co-op isn't HTTP I mean why did we

2043
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:26,269
come up with co-op when HTTP could do

2044
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:29,450
everything that co-op does so that is

2045
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:31,700
that doesn't see these are very

2046
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:33,559
different audiences that the embedded

2047
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:34,580
audience is actually doesn't really have

2048
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:36,350
a lot of differences from the

2049
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:37,790
non-embedded audience and if you're if

2050
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:42,350
what you care about is streaming video

2051
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:43,260
VPNs and the the privacy of your browser

2052
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,920
identity

2053
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:50,610
you're at odds with what embedded needs

2054
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:53,010
so when do we like clearly that split

2055
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:55,889
happened with co-op in HTTP so when do

2056
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:56,910
we embrace that split with authenticated

2057
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:58,800
key exchange and the rest of the

2058
01:48:56,910 --> 01:49:02,180
security pros they just say you know

2059
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:06,260
what TLS serves a different audience and

2060
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:06,260
we're gonna just cut the mic laughter

2061
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:15,120
and the questions that you're going to

2062
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:17,099
ask right you're gonna ask about if

2063
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:18,599
people understand the problem and as the

2064
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:21,600
print and is there gonna be a scope

2065
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:23,489
right I think what I heard is that

2066
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:25,260
people do understand the problem but

2067
01:49:23,489 --> 01:49:27,690
there's two different problems there's

2068
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:29,550
the narrow problem of house corner and

2069
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:31,589
there's the wider problem that the

2070
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:32,940
milestones currently address okay so

2071
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:34,500
when you ask for questions if you can

2072
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:36,660
ask it in a way that doesn't presume

2073
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:38,730
that everyone everybody has the same

2074
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:46,080
problem in mind even though everybody

2075
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:47,940
has a well-defined problem I'm going

2076
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,559
back to the discussion that Eric and I

2077
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:51,660
had at the mic when I last time I got up

2078
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:54,540
to the mic I said the goals and

2079
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:59,130
milestones are much wider phrased

2080
01:49:54,540 --> 01:50:01,530
than escort okay and so for some people

2081
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:04,950
here the problem is the one that the

2082
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:08,610
milestones as worded address about can

2083
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:10,170
hae for constraining devices okay

2084
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:12,450
a different set of people in this room

2085
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:13,830
are here for a more constrained problem

2086
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:16,559
which is one of the problem statement

2087
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:18,330
specifies in the Charter which is I need

2088
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,400
to make a tea specifically for us for

2089
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:21,840
okay there's two different communities

2090
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,219
in this room that each head I

2091
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,540
well-defined problem and that they

2092
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:25,710
understand everybody's problem but they

2093
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:27,840
have a different view of what the scope

2094
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:29,400
can be so my question is when you ask

2095
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,050
your questions on the next slide if you

2096
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:33,739
can ask them in a way that helps me

2097
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:35,610
figure out how to answer the question

2098
01:50:33,739 --> 01:50:37,410
because I don't know which clutch that

2099
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:38,849
you're asking as they are phrased in the

2100
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:40,260
generic sense right the way that their

2101
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:42,480
creation to how to have run successful

2102
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:44,370
BA whose copy the questions it doesn't

2103
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,570
you just copy the phrasing it doesn't

2104
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:48,300
accommodate there's two different views

2105
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:50,369
of what the problem is so I will sit

2106
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:58,110
down now but

2107
01:50:50,369 --> 01:51:01,070
okay girl so so the way I see it I were

2108
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:03,420
here because of the Oscar problem so any

2109
01:51:01,070 --> 01:51:06,239
requirements any solution that doesn't

2110
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:19,889
solve the Oscar problem is not a

2111
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:21,839
solution here okay so so the what do you

2112
01:51:19,889 --> 01:51:24,119
understand the issue I mean even if you

2113
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:25,080
think that the issue is Bank and we

2114
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:28,440
don't have to do anything

2115
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:39,150
do you understand well what to the issue

2116
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:40,379
that's troubling people here so one or

2117
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:43,320
two that you really want to substitute

2118
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:54,179
the issue with the concrete text of the

2119
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:58,219
problem this is defining the trying just

2120
01:51:54,179 --> 01:51:58,219
say the problem that Oscar is facing

2121
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:24,270
okay do you understand the issues Perl

2122
01:52:20,659 --> 01:52:24,929
is when you say is this a problem that

2123
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:27,449
needs solving

2124
01:52:24,929 --> 01:52:30,599
you can split that into questions is as

2125
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:33,839
corner key change a prominent needs

2126
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:36,389
solving and is generalized constrained

2127
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,949
scenario than which is much larger

2128
01:52:36,389 --> 01:52:39,599
problem is that one that needs solving

2129
01:52:37,949 --> 01:52:41,549
those are two different questions okay

2130
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:43,380
when it says is this a problem implies

2131
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:44,820
there's only one problem here we're

2132
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:51,090
talking of the lawyers and problems meet

2133
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:52,530
probably the problem in the scope right

2134
01:52:51,090 --> 01:52:54,360
router in here all right thank you

2135
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:55,889
Broderick versus Nero is a better way to

2136
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:58,489
phrase Thank You Francesca friendly

2137
01:52:55,889 --> 01:52:58,489
amendment except

2138
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:10,290
is that yeah go right ahead mouse that

2139
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:21,989
quest we don't have an editable version

2140
01:53:10,290 --> 01:54:36,329
of the person's the last time we took

2141
01:53:21,989 --> 01:54:38,629
this cable okay okay so alright so we're

2142
01:54:36,329 --> 01:54:40,739
gonna ask these questions

2143
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:43,199
possibly with more amendments as we go

2144
01:54:40,739 --> 01:54:44,579
but let's start with this so if you

2145
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:46,799
understand if you think you understand

2146
01:54:44,579 --> 01:54:53,009
the issues please home now if you

2147
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:58,260
understand theaters if you do not

2148
01:54:53,010 --> 01:55:00,150
understand the issues please home now so

2149
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:02,630
it looks like we understand the issues

2150
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:02,629
flora

2151
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:12,020
okay let's go to the next question in

2152
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:16,130
here so is OS core key exchange a

2153
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:21,650
problem that needs to be solved okay

2154
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:23,270
that's the question if you think OS for

2155
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:27,769
key exchange is not a problem that needs

2156
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:29,930
to be solved please from that so I heard

2157
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:31,550
a for the rate for the first question

2158
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:32,750
very strong home and nothing and for

2159
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:38,900
this question is slightly weaker home

2160
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:41,090
and nothing so the next question is is

2161
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:42,860
the broader constrained scenario a

2162
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:44,180
problem that needs solving if you think

2163
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:50,120
that is a problem that needs solving

2164
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:51,560
please home now if you think that is not

2165
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:57,500
a problem that needs solving please from

2166
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:58,580
now so we had I think two people home

2167
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,990
for that do you want to go to the mic

2168
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:02,530
and say why you think that broader

2169
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:02,530
problems not

2170
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:22,120
hi Makemake hi my name's Phil Harrow

2171
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:23,770
Baker I'm a having been through the

2172
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:26,260
space and implemented in use lots of

2173
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:28,360
Hanna's code my experience is that if

2174
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:31,710
you have enough code space and network

2175
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:34,750
space and others power to run any TLS

2176
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:36,630
those extra bytes don't matter on the

2177
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:40,210
other hand if you're really constrained

2178
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:42,160
then you really doesn't matter so

2179
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:45,510
there's a kind of a step function where

2180
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:48,220
it if you can run a little bit of TLS

2181
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:50,140
then you probably can run a fair bit

2182
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:53,050
more and how does this point to the fact

2183
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:55,270
that you don't do a lot of akes over the

2184
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:59,710
lifespan of the device it's probably

2185
01:56:55,270 --> 01:57:02,850
relatively true and so I'm not sure that

2186
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:05,680
that if you really want to do run empty

2187
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:07,270
qmq today and the qtt thank you I've

2188
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:09,850
never was get it wrong if you really are

2189
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:12,790
running that the overhead of your

2190
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:15,010
security is probably not what's killing

2191
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:17,140
your network it's probably other things

2192
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:19,120
so that okay so you've kind of done a

2193
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:21,070
stat point so we're burned up throughout

2194
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:23,140
three minutes you need to do a couple

2195
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:25,929
more things but so I would pray briefing

2196
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:29,290
I post a link to a paper that I recently

2197
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:31,150
wrote with manual on firmware hates and

2198
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:34,840
there we do an analysis of different

2199
01:57:31,150 --> 01:57:37,450
crypto libraries and the issue if the

2200
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:40,240
code size is not the TLS stack it's the

2201
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:43,300
triple different and again very briefly

2202
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:44,950
so the question was do we need this for

2203
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:49,300
our score and the answer is yes we do

2204
01:57:44,950 --> 01:57:52,330
and there are other ways to do a key

2205
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:54,040
exchange use TLS to do that you can roll

2206
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:55,750
your own but the point is there should

2207
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:58,510
be way to do it to non score that

2208
01:57:55,750 --> 01:58:00,430
doesn't require some extra protocol okay

2209
01:57:58,510 --> 01:58:04,270
so when I turned home anyway I think I

2210
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:06,070
had a very big home positively and a few

2211
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:07,930
people who then happily came to the mic

2212
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:09,130
and give us some negative reaction so I

2213
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:10,990
think the other questions don't need at

2214
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:13,960
it so it's the ITF the right place to

2215
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:16,469
solve to work on this if you think it is

2216
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,470
from that

2217
01:58:16,579 --> 01:58:23,299
if you think the IHF is not the right

2218
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:31,889
place from nothing thank you

2219
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:33,840
were you hoping it was at you all right

2220
01:58:31,889 --> 01:58:36,300
so how many people are willing to

2221
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:39,679
contribute text write code be very

2222
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:42,840
active you split that question across

2223
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:44,999
sure how many people so in the context

2224
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:48,780
of a score how many people are willing

2225
01:58:44,999 --> 01:58:50,579
to contribute text and review documents

2226
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:58,550
and do be otherwise active working with

2227
01:58:50,579 --> 01:59:01,978
participants I guess okay so it's a

2228
01:58:58,550 --> 01:59:04,530
bunch thank you in the context of not a

2229
01:59:01,979 --> 01:59:05,969
score in the context of not Oscar I

2230
01:59:04,530 --> 01:59:10,018
guess is the uplift in the broader

2231
01:59:05,969 --> 01:59:14,219
question how many people and now I'm

2232
01:59:10,019 --> 01:59:17,140
curious I think in it's fewer and how

2233
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:20,940
many people put their hand up both times

2234
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:20,940
[Laughter]

2235
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:27,478
that's for the 80s to figure it suppose

2236
01:59:25,889 --> 01:59:32,219
there's some overlap but there's also

2237
01:59:27,479 --> 01:59:36,239
some significant disjunction so I

2238
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:39,840
counted 15 to 17 for us for I counted 10

2239
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:45,928
to 11 for the general case and but three

2240
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:47,070
or four overlapping okay so in terms of

2241
01:59:45,929 --> 01:59:49,199
the deliverables this is the idea of

2242
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:50,369
working the requirements text and then

2243
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:53,489
not throwing it in our C and then

2244
01:59:50,369 --> 01:59:54,839
documenting a protocol I think do you

2245
01:59:53,489 --> 01:59:55,799
understand what the deliverables are I

2246
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,929
think that's pretty clear actually

2247
01:59:55,800 --> 02:00:09,510
anybody want to home that they don't

2248
01:59:57,929 --> 02:00:11,989
understand the deliverables No so minus

2249
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:11,989
zero minutes

2250
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:25,280
yeah okay so I think essentially we're

2251
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:27,110
out of time and I don't think we're

2252
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:30,280
gonna have much information a ladies

2253
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:33,170
want to grab my car anything else

2254
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:36,440
there's a manliness the discussion can

2255
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:38,540
should continue there as well yeah it

2256
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:41,000
sounds like there's a still conversation

2257
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:43,670
a half but there's energy for an Oscar

2258
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:49,030
and there's interested a broader thing

2259
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:49,030
we need to talk about okay mailing list

2260
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:14,230
so if you didn't sign the blue sheet

2261
02:01:11,179 --> 02:01:14,230
star over here you need
