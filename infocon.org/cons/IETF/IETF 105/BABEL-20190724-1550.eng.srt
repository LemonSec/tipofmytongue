1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,680
now I'm calmed out for a little bit

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:24,029
how many times have you Rachel

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,310
twelve I think I've sort of been a knock

4
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,650
on five time for one this is a chair and

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,049
when was this a previous chair sevens

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:46,980
looked at three times I think I

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:50,010
volunteered every year I could no yeah I

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,169
was um I don't know when I started

9
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,640
volunteering for now calm my pocket for

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,300
a while at every turn that's good

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,980
every year but no I think this is 20 I

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,968
think I've been coming to IETF since

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,449
1990

14
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,899
I've long period as much with the bunkum

15
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,950
I'm not selected voting members can they

16
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:11,400
figure out what position I should

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,750
nominate for deflating to be cleaned

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,420
filling out the questionnaire but I have

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,280
my previous questionnaire this way and

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:25,710
then I actually enjoy the interviews a

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:33,380
lot and I never get selected so whatever

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:51,419
I guess we should Stuart is 315 long

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:56,880
okay hi everybody this is the table

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,430

is packed all there's not an empty seat

26

okay pretty good yeah thanks you know

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,040
after two or three more IETF so I'm sure

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,350
I'll get it straight then they'll change

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,850
the system okay we have the no twelve

42
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,239
people should read that were subject to

43
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,269
the IETF IPR policies and actually we

44
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,320
it's because it's an IETF meeting

45
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,350
actually subject to them whether or not

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:29,870
this notice is shown and this is really

47
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:34,180
disk assembly yeah so this doesn't it's

48
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,180
not really synced to the page very well

49
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:44,359
okay press the button on the screen here

50
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,280
we go okay excellent

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,930
yeah and this is just a summary and it

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:54,980
points to the other documents that are

53
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:57,500
the actual full policy I shouldn't do

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,959
that should I know okay

55
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,780
that's why should okay so people should

56
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,910
reviewed arguments it's good thing to do

57
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,769
and helps the quality of the documents

58
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,090
you know what moves you can post them to

59
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,660
the working group mailing list or

60
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,470
whatever and that way you get your

61
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,969
documents reviewed more likely

62
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:23,710
this is the current agenda we're going

63
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:27,430
over the agenda right now to see what we

64
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:32,280
have a jabber and minutes scribe

65
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:34,900
volunteers even Barbara so the shape

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,320
well there's a some slides here to go

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,690
over the status of milestones and stuff

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,040
then it would have Barbara's present on

69
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,390
the status of the available information

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:51,460
model draft and mesh on the yang model

71
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:53,500
and that keeps remotely on the delay

72
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,030
based measurement and the metric

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,890
extension for the available protocol is

74
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,950
there any agenda a bashing people would

75
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:10,560
like to add or delete or reorder or

76
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:14,610
anything like that I guess not so I

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,200
guess I will proceed with status

78
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,890
documents we have this great set of four

79
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,770
documents clickability RFC 6120 six this

80
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:29,440
and through security detail s and H Mac

81
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:31,409
that are all through ITF last call and I

82
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,550
don't believe there are any notable

83
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,850
comments or complaints about them during

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:40,240
IETF last call so they are scheduled for

85
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:46,060
the iesg to formally consider on august

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,160
8th and that's a good package of the

87
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,590
basic documents with the protocol and

88
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,870
security and applicability is

89
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,659
informational the other three are

90
00:05:51,870 --> 00:06:00,040
standards track in the working group we

91
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:04,080
have documents which I guess all of

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,080
these source specific are going to be

93
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:14,800
that's true now that I think about it if

94
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,880
I should edit I really entered things on

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,669
here sorry is a slightly out of date

96
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,789
mostly if today with the source specific

97
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:27,820
we have approved and the publication is

98
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,320
requested however it still needs a ad

99
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,230
review

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:36,659
you and I ATF last call and so forth so

101
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:38,730
it's no longer is how it is incorrect to

102
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,930
say this in working group last call it

103
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:46,320
is out of that state the home that

104
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:51,840
vehicle profile draft is I believe

105
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,969
waiting on RFC 6120 six bits so it's in

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,380
the RFC debtors queue but waiting on our

107
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:01,980
work that's in the home net working

108
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:05,130
group Julia's sent information on

109
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:09,240
implementation to me on are a few which

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:13,500
is to speak but you can see here it is

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:19,080
information on the status of they will

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:23,190
they bird FRR and spld aware that their

113
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,979
level of compliance is currently and

114
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:30,630
there have been updates to Wireshark and

115
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:33,120
TCP dump thank you we don't they've been

116
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,590
submitted not merged but Wireshark can

117
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:43,440
parse the latest RFC 6120 six bits

118
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:44,869
protocol messages looking at the

119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,090
milestones we're

120
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:54,360
we have milestones the last three are

121
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,250
ones which we know what the status is

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,170
we're making progress on them but for

123
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,880
about a year after the year least first

124
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:04,110
to about nine months maybe after the

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:09,140
original projected date for these

126
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:12,290
milestones but source specific is

127
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,669
publication requested the information

128
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,890
model and the management draft which we

129
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:21,180
consider the yang draft to be the

130
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,710
management draft or like making good

131
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,270
progress of this presentations on those

132
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:29,780
so that's the status so going back to

133
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,830
the agenda

134
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,709
somebody has questions underneath that

135
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,409
the next thing is the available

136
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,460
information model

137
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,459
let's see so

138
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,940
[Music]

139
00:08:43,070 --> 00:09:04,920
because that doesn't excact

140
00:08:46,940 --> 00:09:07,130
to the okay I can do like that looks

141
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,130
good

142
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:14,790
Barbara's gonna need this here

143
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,410
physically closer to her unless you you

144
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,089
understand in the paint spot when you

145
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:27,350
get over here I'll hang your under the

146
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:30,330
anvil yeah just the light it's okay

147
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,180
so let's see oh I think it's working

148
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:38,820
um let's see not that oh there we go

149
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,229
okay so we did do sort of a working

150
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,970
group last call and I did some updates

151
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,579
some of these updates are going to be

152
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,610
made irrelevant the one that I did want

153
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:53,069
to call out just to make sure that we

154
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,690
still have the agreement that I thought

155
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,300
we had and that I recorded in the

156
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,070
minutes last time which was the third

157
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,319
from the end the one where we have the

158
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,980
router ID value must not consist of all

159
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,709
zeros or all ones and if anybody has

160
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:13,130
issues with that you know you can you

161
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:13,130
can come to the microphone and say so

162
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,399
they want to see me and not the chairs

163
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,399
Oh

164
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:31,969
okay but that's the only one I wanted to

165
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:36,939
highlight then I'm my my list of issues

166
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:41,179
is really short now this is where I

167
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:44,719
finally you know parsed Julius's emails

168
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:47,899
I think correctly and we understood one

169
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,790
another and this is what I think we

170
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,889
agreed on which is we're going to

171
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,319
completely delete I an a consideration

172
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:57,649
section yay we have no a Ana

173
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,939
considerations anymore which makes me

174
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,850
happy

175
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:05,719
I love the I Anna people but I hate

176
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:09,290
having to considerate um okay so then we

177
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,579
also will delete those parameters the

178
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,699
link properties everywhere and we'll

179
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:19,189
have let's see make the battle interface

180
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,679
metric algorithm read what read write

181
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,420
and then at a boolean because I think a

182
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,269
boolean it was is the appropriate thing

183
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,699
for something that is either used or not

184
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,569
used which would be the the split

185
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:34,758
horizon parameter and I'm not adding RTT

186
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,498
at this time because I just don't know

187
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,360
how far our tea tea is going and I don't

188
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,490
want to build a dependency on it and so

189
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,129
I recommend that in the RTT draft that

190
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,839
they can have a little section that says

191
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:51,379
and this adds the following parameters

192
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:53,990
to the data model kind of thing this one

193
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:58,069
we also discussed on the list and that

194
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:04,579
is replace the K out of J enumeration

195
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:08,929
with a two out of three and then this

196
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:10,699
one we discussed on the list and this

197
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:14,629
was one of the suggestions which I

198
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:20,019
really liked the best and that is that

199
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:23,410
we simply allow for it to be the

200
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:28,639
received in calculated metrics to be

201
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:31,730
expressed as a signed integer if needed

202
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,679
by the data model since it's just

203
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,720
something that's reported and never gets

204
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,809
you know sent back it should be just

205
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,809
fine

206
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:45,619
and that concludes all my issues and all

207
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,689
my issues have proposed resolutions

208
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,910
directly attached to them so if

209
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:52,610
everybody's fine with all of those I

210
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,079
suggest that I put them in do an o8 real

211
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,819
quickly we can maybe have another wgl C

212
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,620
and then move on what do you want David

213
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:04,670
oh I don't want anything

214
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,100
Julius however Julius yeah

215
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,759
from the Jabbar this looks to me like a

216
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,329
hack

217
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:14,300
shouldn't it be encoded more intuitively

218
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:18,229
which what are you talking about man

219
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:21,319
yeah I don't know now I was talking back

220
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:28,910
to Julius now let's see oh he's using

221
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:29,509
negative numbers as null oh it is what

222
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,839
it is

223
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:36,680
it's the way tr1 81 does it you want to

224
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:41,180
call it a hack that's fine but it's the

225
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,128
way it's expressed and so as long as I'm

226
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,839
as long as I'm allowed to do it you know

227
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,790
take it from the Information model and

228
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,839
do it that way that everybody's happy

229
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,079
and everything's fine

230
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,259
Julius is asking if there's precedent

231
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,120
yes it's it's it's been defined for

232
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:59,300
about 15 years now that way

233
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,100
I think that's precedent I'm speaking

234
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:09,800
personally you if there's precedent I'm

235
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:11,680
fine with it and he says he says he'll

236
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:21,050
shut up and retain the right to grumble

237
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:23,569
words okay so that's what I'd like to do

238
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,800
one more quick wgl see and if nobody

239
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:30,679
speaks up and says anything Marta yes

240
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,800
that's all Martin speaking as part of

241
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:40,360
the review of Babel the piece draft a

242
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,359
comment was made that it's not

243
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:49,020
the outer ID should be all Benari should

244
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:53,670
not must not be all banal zeros or all

245
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:56,280
veena a ones and I'm eating in your so

246
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,310
the modification that was made in the

247
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,100
Babylon Beast raft as part of that leave

248
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:05,130
you since you have some text in your

249
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,900
information model that says the same you

250
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,600
should apply the same modification add

251
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:16,140
the pin the notion that it's zeros and

252
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:20,180
ones as B'nai so I'm trying to you're

253
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,180
trying to follow what I'm saying yeah

254
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,030
you're saying the router ID value must

255
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:32,089
not consist of all zeros or all ones yes

256
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:36,750
we had that same sentence in the IFC

257
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:40,290
6126 piece okay

258
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:45,660
this sentence has changed in that are in

259
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,949
that document to say binary zeros and

260
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,430
binary ones

261
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:56,070
oh oh now I hear what you're saying oh

262
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:59,130
that's super easy okay to clarifies like

263
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,620
I made that change it's just a phrasing

264
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,160
to be more clear so instead of saying

265
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,710
all zeros no one we says UXO Jojo Jojo

266
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,329
just to be or Z or X ffffff to bright

267
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,980
very clear what we bet

268
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,810
of course you know here in the

269
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,620
information model it's a binary data

270
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,540
type and so that's fine

271
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,240
so so basically you're just saying stick

272
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,980
the word binary in front of zeros and

273
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,370
ones look at what's in six one two six

274
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:30,180
bits okay I'm now channeling cocaine

275
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,130
hole in jorgensen did you record this in

276
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:40,020
the minutes for me Russ cuz I know I

277
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:43,560
didn't okay so back on the topic of -1

278
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,850
for now he's asking if the information

279
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,640
model should just have a way of

280
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,650
specifying null and then leave negative

281
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,280
numbers to implementation-specific

282
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,280
encodings

283
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:01,640
so the different data models have

284
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,609
different properties and I was just

285
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:09,700
trying to leave flexibility for the data

286
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:15,260
models to model themselves within their

287
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:18,530
well their realms Mahesh Mahesh Aiken

288
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:21,140
and Danny out then I would be looking

289
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,649
for a suggestion on how do we encode

290
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,860
this to indicate now when it has been

291
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:31,370
zero is a valid value I would be looking

292
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,409
for tell me how do so you want the data

293
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,610
model to be a little more explicit than

294
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,300
this

295
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,240
meaning if people are objecting and they

296
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,000
don't like the idea of negative values

297
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,710
signifying unspecified then maybe they

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,450
should tell us how they want us to

299
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:53,030
represent unspecified state maybe do we

300
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,500
need another flag in the info in the

301
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,320
information model it says that this

302
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,960
value has not been set now well does

303
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,960
yang have anything similar any similar

304
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,970
issue to this I don't know no I I think

305
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,520
it I have the same issue that's why I'm

306
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,160
asking this question oh you do okay okay

307
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,100
if they don't like the way we're trying

308
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,530
to represent it in either TR 181 or yang

309
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:19,490
I would be like us to represent it well

310
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:23,120
and I mean in 181 you know i it kind of

311
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,710
the text that one eight one has on data

312
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:33,189
modeling where it specifically says that

313
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:38,420
um no values are modeled as negative one

314
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:41,240
using a signed integer and and tia 181

315
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,520
specifically has this in its rule set

316
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,450
this is how you data this is how you

317
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,180
model something where you need to

318
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,190
represent know for an integer you for an

319
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,720
unsigned integer you make it a signed

320
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,160
integer and you use a negative one and

321
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,470
that's our rules so I took it again oh I

322
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,810
misread Terra when anyone already has a

323
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,330
representation for null but it's a bad

324
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,570
one gotcha I can live with negative

325
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,570
number

326
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:14,209
and so you're okay with this - okay

327
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,010
that was my hush I was asking for those

328
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,890
of you who couldn't see Mahesh nodding

329
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:25,160
anyway um so I think we're good

330
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:28,550
cool good yeah unless there's further

331
00:19:25,160 --> 00:20:00,200
comments or questions which I don't see

332
00:19:28,550 --> 00:20:02,050
any of thanks all right my presentation

333
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,320
awful would be even shorter than

334
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:09,830
Barbara's because I track her

335
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,620
information model so the changes to the

336
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,090
latest version which I didn't get to of

337
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,790
course before the cutoff but I did

338
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:21,590
submit on Monday and I'm sure all of you

339
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:24,500
have read it is there is tracking zero

340
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,300
seven and I guess if she goes zero it

341
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,750
and I will make another I have to catch

342
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:33,649
up with the last set of changes and then

343
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:36,620
we'll talk about last call anyway so I

344
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:41,210
do have three issues that I wanted to

345
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:43,810
kind of talk about in management systems

346
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:48,370
it's generally considered a good idea to

347
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:50,750
suggest or I think as default values

348
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,810
simply because operators sometimes don't

349
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,760
know what to set so if some guidance is

350
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:59,090
given they appreciate it

351
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,080
so I kind of listed some default values

352
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:07,060
that I thought made sense but I'll let

353
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,060
our group tell me now that don't do this

354
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,780
so if

355
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,540
I'm gonna pause and let you kind of scan

356
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,050
through and tell me that some of these

357
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:40,040
values don't really make sense and I can

358
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:40,040
even explain why okay we can't hear you

359
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,079
[Music]

360
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:27,899
and second point the expected multicast

361
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:29,700
hello alright sure I can remove that now

362
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,260
the other thing

363
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,850
Mahesh that you and I had been

364
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:40,730
discussing was that we were expecting

365
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:43,439
well the interface table object is not

366
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,170
writable that is from a management

367
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,420
perspective you can't create new

368
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:52,140
interfaces and so defaults would really

369
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,060
only apply from the perspective of the

370
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,980
implementation itself creating the

371
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:01,230
instances okay so yes and no the

372
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,150
existence of the interface of course is

373
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,800
system driven so system creates the

374
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:09,410
interface but for example enabling it

375
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:14,070
you can either come up enabled if

376
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:17,040
default true or you can come up enabled

377
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,960
default false which means either you can

378
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,590
either the interface comes up and is

379
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,650
enabled by default or it is disabled by

380
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,649
default

381
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:31,810
and I guess my question in this goes to

382
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:37,270
the people listening like Julius is do

383
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:38,950
we need to specify a default do we need

384
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,220
to know it that it comes up true or

385
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:46,030
comes up false ended and what does it

386
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,880
mean in the context because this is in

387
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,889
in the yang model because I've resisted

388
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,810
putting this in the information model so

389
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:58,510
this is not something that would apply

390
00:23:52,810 --> 00:24:00,159
to other instantiations of the

391
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,810
information model using different data

392
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,600
models and it would only apply to Yang

393
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:07,480
and I'm trying to understand do we need

394
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,740
really to know whether it comes up

395
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,290
enabled or disabled it okay so just like

396
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,850
quick responds it's it's boolean either

397
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:57,760
going to come up true or it's gonna come

398
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:59,350
up falls under default implementation to

399
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,030
the implementation how it should behave

400
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:06,250
by default no this is not yang

401
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:10,480
monitoring implementation how to behave

402
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:14,490
what it is doing is when the first set

403
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,780
of configs come down to to the router

404
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,600
it's saying this is what the set of

405
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:23,080
default values it might come with unless

406
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,750
of course you override them and taking

407
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,429
the enable example is that when that

408
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,430
when you see that first set of config

409
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,850
it'll tell that outer enable the

410
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,850
interface

411
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:43,340
cuz I know I don't understand here where

412
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:45,170
are those always used from an

413
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,330
implementation point of view at which

414
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,910
point do I need to take these values

415
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,689
into account from an implementation

416
00:25:49,910 --> 00:26:00,470
perspective no it's the management

417
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:02,600
system telling you that after you since

418
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,030
this instance is created I'm giving you

419
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:10,070
a set of config file use and one of them

420
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:15,590
is the set of defaults in it yeah by

421
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:18,860
default you you should now if there's an

422
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:23,510
interface state which is admin state

423
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:26,030
might set it to enable so these values

424
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,950
will be explicitly in the configuration

425
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,139
work or will they be inferred

426
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,720
automatically if they're absent from the

427
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:38,860
configuration block they will be

428
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:44,470
explicitly specified for the implement

429
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:47,120
set in the in the code or sorry in the

430
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:53,080
state of the system I don't know if I'm

431
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:56,500
making that clear yes they explicitly

432
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,490
specified them what makes them default

433
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,330
okay good question

434
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:05,930
so they they are default from the client

435
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,570
the management client perspective so

436
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:12,710
it's the management client when it's

437
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:16,879
trying to configure Babel it says there

438
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:20,840
are all these parameters that I may or

439
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:25,570
may not have to specify and in in there

440
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:29,470
there are some defaults that it can set

441
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:31,730
and send it down to the router to say

442
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:36,410
this is how I want the initial

443
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:38,690
configuration to look like okay I don't

444
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,690
feel very comfortable with that so for

445
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,830
example the metric algorithm or the

446
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:49,360
split horizon values are going to depend

447
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:52,870
an interface is wired or wireless okay

448
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,550
so those values would be fine except for

449
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,310
the hello seconals

450
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:02,950
these values would be fine if we assume

451
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:05,409
that all links are wired I see

452
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,630
so on a wireless link they are simply

453
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:13,000
incorrect they will break your network

454
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,690
if you use them on wired link so I have

455
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,960
a proposal

456
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,000
David's cannot see how about we define

457
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,610
so for some of these it's pretty

458
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,280
straightforward stay a port the default

459
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,050
is six six nine six and that's an easy

460
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,629
one I don't think there is any argument

461
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:31,270
there but for some things like say the

462
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:34,720
metric algorithm we could define an

463
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,340
algorithm which is just default and all

464
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,320
that says and that's what we would put

465
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,429
in the default field here and all that

466
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,370
says is hey implementation be smart

467
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,570
would that solve everyone's concerns I

468
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:50,439
think that's what happens if you don't

469
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:52,030
think differently 800 actually so Mahesh

470
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:58,090
what happens if we don't have a default

471
00:28:52,030 --> 00:29:01,480
value so okay first of all yes I should

472
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:05,040
clarify that a default values if you

473
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,990
don't specify and they're not mandatory

474
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,300
it's up to the implementation what it

475
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:14,260
does with that particular attribute if

476
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,629
it's a mandatory attribute then usually

477
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,070
the expectation is that the management

478
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,800
system will provide a default value

479
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,200
because it's mandatory so it has to have

480
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,090
a value it's better to specify something

481
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,910
that is reasonable and something that is

482
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,020
doesn't make any sense so I don't

483
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:37,240
remember if any of these are mandatory

484
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:39,910
so in just for those of us who don't

485
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,400
speak yang in what mandatory means in

486
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:48,940
the context of yang I think what we

487
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:52,810
discussed the mandatory meant was if you

488
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:55,570
are saying if the management system is

489
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,700
providing you know saying I want you to

490
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,659
prevent you know write a value or

491
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:04,680
to metric algorithm it has to provide a

492
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:08,200
value it cannot provide an empty string

493
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:11,050
a little more than that it's saying that

494
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,740
are the implementation is saying that I

495
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:17,919
need you to tell me that what this value

496
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,340
should be because without it I don't

497
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:24,850
know what to do right for example metric

498
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:27,010
algorithm if a if you don't tell me then

499
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,139
what am I supposed to choose it will

500
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,090
already have a value I mean the

501
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,810
implementation is the one that created

502
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,310
this interface okay um so then my

503
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,980
question is why can't that be the

504
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,540
default value well because it has its

505
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,440
own logic that it goes through an

506
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:46,360
assigning a value oh no it looks at the

507
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,700
link that came up and it said oh this

508
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:53,370
link is attached to my you know radio

509
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:57,250
and so I'm going to decide to assign it

510
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:59,620
okay good point then in that case in

511
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:03,160
yang terms this is not a mandatory field

512
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,560
because it you you're deriving that

513
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,250
value based on certain other parameters

514
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,600
so there yes right so I really think you

515
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,120
know we've got the port number in the

516
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,040
multicast group and we've even got those

517
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:22,030
defaults to find in the information

518
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:24,190
model and I think probably you want to

519
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:28,620
let the implementation have logic on

520
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:32,290
whether it comes up enabled or not

521
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:36,189
rather than try and suggest that the

522
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:38,230
yang model knows better and so I'm

523
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,810
really thinking just the first two and

524
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,660
we already have defaults for those okay

525
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,850
I think yes we've pretty much ruled out

526
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:52,570
so I don't remember what we said about

527
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:57,399
TX cost diseases fine zero is fine in

528
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:59,139
most circumstances okay but for the

529
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,390
Barretts colossi for all the other ones

530
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,070
I agree with Barbara just saying these

531
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:07,660
are like non-mandatory and no default

532
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:10,570
values seems easier fair enough math we

533
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,440
go another yang expert but could it be

534
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,289
that

535
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,860
some of these are in fact state rather

536
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,149
than configured if they are state then

537
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,918
absolutely

538
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:26,129
there's no point or you can't even

539
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:29,529
specify a default value yes then yeah I

540
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:31,809
know that we can bend back and forth

541
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:39,039
whether it's state or config and maybe I

542
00:32:31,809 --> 00:33:21,120
might not have changes completely

543
00:32:39,039 --> 00:33:28,750
changed on me yes it's automatically

544
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:32,860
using okay so then I'm left three port

545
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:36,009
number multicast group n TX cost okay I

546
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,469
would I would also say to also remove TX

547
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:40,299
costs because I think it like Jesus was

548
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,600
saying it would work but I'm not sure

549
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:46,259
there's a lot of value and specifying a

550
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,149
default here similar to the other ones

551
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,399
the implementation will come up with a

552
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:53,168
sensible default on its own so I don't

553
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,059
think it should be a mandatory or with

554
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:56,230
the defaults as well whereas port number

555
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,000
of multicast groups the router can't

556
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,250
even get started without those I think

557
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,950
those are the only two that are like

558
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,840
crucial and mandatory because doesn't

559
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,139
work otherwise okay so then let me ask

560
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:13,270
the most question I am assuming that TX

561
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:15,520
cost is a credible parameter if what

562
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,389
happens if the management system puts

563
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,389
some hundred

564
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:26,150
because we have not specified a default

565
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,620
well specifying a default won't prevent

566
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:32,300
the magnet system from passing in a

567
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:34,400
hundred right no it doesn't prevent it

568
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,490
by default of course yeah if you don't

569
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,440
set it will set it to zero well if we

570
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,359
don't set the default it just don't send

571
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,330
anything to the implementation let it do

572
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,830
the right thing okay

573
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:52,909
again I don't remember that this is

574
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:56,840
mandatory or not but okay

575
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:59,839
I took an action item in the last

576
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,400
meeting to say let me see if I can come

577
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,060
up with an example and I do want to

578
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:09,890
thank Judas for sending me and output of

579
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:11,630
how about his router looked like what I

580
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,609
could glean through was unfortunately

581
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,130
not too much information as far as

582
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:19,540
config was concerned it was state a lot

583
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:24,350
of state information but not enough of

584
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:26,330
config so I have a very very simple

585
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:30,049
example I would really like to expand on

586
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:33,440
this and what I'm referring to if I can

587
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:38,980
get the pointer oh so in this example

588
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:44,300
all I'm doing is I'm enabling Babel and

589
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:46,940
I'm enabling statistics gathering as I

590
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,260
said very simple ideally I'd like to

591
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:54,160
expand this to be a little more

592
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:59,060
comprehensive in terms of config so

593
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,430
please help me for all the parameters if

594
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,250
you can tell me what is some of the

595
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:12,740
values that I would like to expand on

596
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:17,780
this okay this was an open issue in the

597
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:20,390
in 104 so I started to look at it and I

598
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,300
said well I don't really know Bible that

599
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,370
much but I so I need to understand what

600
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,670
aspects of routing policy need to be

601
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:32,220
augmented and what I have are some

602
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:35,839
examples of what for BGP does

603
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:39,359
so I would like to similarly understand

604
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:47,940
what aspects of the learning policy we

605
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:52,160
want to augment had for Babel again it's

606
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:56,609
an action item for the rookie group and

607
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,980
that is pretty much it on this slide

608
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:02,578
Julius is saying he'll send examples to

609
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:05,400
the list okay and now so this slide

610
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,410
doesn't mean it's for the example of the

611
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:15,990
routing policy

612
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:18,240
joyas which side anyway I think I lost

613
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:26,240
routing policy examples to the list okay

614
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:26,240
thank you okay thank you presentation

615
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:56,800
okay so Baptiste if I guess if you

616
00:37:51,220 --> 00:38:08,470
request the microphone you can speak I

617
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:12,369
can advance the slides here or hi there

618
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:16,589
we go do you hear me yep we can see you

619
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:25,470
in a little image that's weird

620
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:30,280
okay okay okay yes we do

621
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:36,430
is it better okay

622
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:40,270
can you hear me yes okay good so I'm

623
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:42,460
going to present as a new draft on the

624
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:46,509
delayed based metric I've I've got

625
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:50,320
adopted recently so this this is work I

626
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:56,430
did reduce some some time ago and now

627
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm doing a PhD in Ghana in France so

628
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:03,368
can you go to the next stag please thank

629
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,590
you so I will provide an overview so

630
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:09,070
Judas already explained about the draft

631
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:12,119
last time so I will be quick when

632
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:14,980
somewhat about implementation and then

633
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:20,980
what idea is to update the draft to

634
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:25,240
progress next time please okay so the

635
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,670
menus case is overlay networks where

636
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,709
basically you have Babel has no

637
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,760
information on the underlying topology

638
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:36,790
so if you just use up comes as a metric

639
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,740
you will you will you will end up with a

640
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:45,730
very wrong within choices fastest go

641
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,899
from NASA from Marseilles to Lille using

642
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:53,390
Tokyo Paris is the same if you just

643
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:55,940
choose up comes so the next step is so

644
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:58,879
the basic idea is to use our teaching

645
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:04,579
measurements on each link and they were

646
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:07,930
the metric from that so it's not as easy

647
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:10,400
to do as just like something a ping or

648
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:13,009
during your protocol that works stacked

649
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,089
like this and because that is a

650
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:20,990
synchronous so you get buffers TLDs

651
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:23,119
and then something at some point it has

652
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:27,259
some jitter to avoid synchronization

653
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,410
zone so basically you solution we found

654
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:38,359
west was to use the same algorithm as

655
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:42,348
ntp next type is okay so basically pure

656
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:44,328
i expands a message to kirby we record

657
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:47,510
the timestamp from the Thunder and

658
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:50,420
Samsung at the receiver prevents tunnel

659
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,510
time elapses and we decided to send

660
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:56,660
message a at some point and we also

661
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,609
remember autumn stones and the second

662
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:03,009
issue is human the oddity you just have

663
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:05,808
to subtract the patterns or write

664
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:09,589
between t print one and two point two

665
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:14,420
and I graduated t the last thing that it

666
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:16,940
works even with the clocks are not

667
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,430
synchronized it just need to have the

668
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,240
same right which is reasonable if you

669
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:25,180
wait a few seconds yeah that's it next

670
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,669
slide please

671
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,890
so yeah basically we send these

672
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:34,430
timestamps that we need to 42

673
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:39,140
measurements in hello messages so that's

674
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:41,210
one on on top and for the written

675
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,299
message so we also send the timestamp in

676
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:47,750
the hello message but we also copy then

677
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:51,288
some for the previous message in I yet

678
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:54,529
few messages so that a at the end can

679
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:59,350
can use all these timestamps to computer

680
00:41:54,529 --> 00:42:02,230
additive yeah the Samsung

681
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:07,259
you searched these two to encode the

682
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:09,970
data in the messages next slide please

683
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:17,100
yeah this is a this is a format for

684
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:23,919
hello and I you you okay next time and

685
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:25,720
really be trusted so this is next

686
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,730
picture that Jurgis used on the last

687
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,279
time which I find quite interesting and

688
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:36,490
because with this ago is immune centers

689
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,290
but then you can add noise and so on so

690
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:42,939
we have a smoothing algorithm to get

691
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:46,060
nice nice Rattata values when we use a

692
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,080
function to obtain a metric potentially

693
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,790
we have a linear codes that is

694
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:55,049
configurable then you get a metric and

695
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:58,090
then there's a another layer of

696
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:02,980
stabilization let's say to decide which

697
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:07,390
routes which route you want to select I

698
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:08,340
will talk a lot about smoothing but next

699
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:12,759
slide please

700
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,890
yeah so that's the way we so that's an

701
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:20,080
example of a way to compute the metric

702
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:22,420
from the ATT and Inter draft we really

703
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,640
say it's up to the implementation but

704
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:28,140
it's a reference filtration with this

705
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:32,500
one and it works it works fine so

706
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,420
probably a good idea so if they're at

707
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,600
least motive and value we just use a

708
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:40,810
fixed cost if it's higher been a cable

709
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,850
that you probably means that there is a

710
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:49,150
saturation somewhere so we we have a

711
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:53,350
maximum metric value maximum cost and in

712
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:54,790
between just a linear map so the the

713
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:58,200
path on the right is really designed to

714
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:00,130
avoid oscillations because if you have

715
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:05,109
the skilful network is completely

716
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:08,710
saturated you the cost will be maximum

717
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:09,930
for all links and it would prevent or at

718
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,470
least limit

719
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:18,790
association that you could get otherwise

720
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:21,520
okay next type is oh yeah you see if you

721
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:25,060
want more details Jewish plantation is

722
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:31,990
available and we we wrote a paper or so

723
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:37,330
that is freely available okay

724
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:40,029
implementation so during my internship I

725
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:44,140
implemented with this extension in the

726
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:50,260
reference implementation Babel D yeah it

727
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:52,420
was five years ago so took expressed an

728
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,980
interest when pronounce this accession

729
00:44:52,420 --> 00:45:00,970
inverter which is which is nice so we

730
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:04,870
see if it's interoperates and for the

731
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:07,750
other implementations for the intentions

732
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:14,290
I have no idea if if I was interested

733
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:16,960
not and so it's it's still a draft but

734
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:19,450
it's already used in production so

735
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,900
French company is using that for an eval

736
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:25,660
a network in production there's also

737
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:31,660
another company I guess

738
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:35,770
Althea but it is using this extension in

739
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:39,009
a national truck where they have both

740
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:42,040
wireless links fibrous protein

741
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,660
sweeteners internet leaks and they don't

742
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,270
they don't want were to configure us a

743
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,830
metric on each link based on whether

744
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:50,770
it's a local link and long distance mink

745
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:53,819
so they just use this FD t extension and

746
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:57,700
it gives a right metric automatically

747
00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:01,690
and also has a project called the

748
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:05,169
liberal mesh which follow I think is

749
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:07,390
using OLS or DMX know I think the DMX

750
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,340
and they are looking at switching to

751
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:12,430
battle and they would use this extension

752
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:19,530
or so so it will potentially be used in

753
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:19,529
several community networks next I please

754
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,558
okay

755
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:29,460
so these are just like smaller dates on

756
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:33,180
the graph on the draft so I got some

757
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:37,319
questions about unicast hello and oh I

758
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:40,109
will time some protein in case so it's

759
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:47,880
not that different but could be

760
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:51,029
clarified there's a typo yeah the third

761
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,559
point is just by the way it's the way

762
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:59,849
the packet format is required in the

763
00:46:52,559 --> 00:47:02,789
draft you can understand that values as

764
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:05,819
16 bits and then there is a gap with new

765
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:10,500
information the field well it's actually

766
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:13,319
30 bits but it's unaligned so I got

767
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:16,559
bitten by this today again sorry needs

768
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:20,160
to be clarified and of course we're to

769
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:23,180
wait until the new byberry sig comes out

770
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:28,920
so that you can update your references

771
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:35,339
so next slide is the most service needs

772
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:38,400
some some discussion so basically as you

773
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:43,020
see we need 12 in the same battle

774
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:46,200
packets both hello and I hate you

775
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:51,140
because we need the three time stamps

776
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,140
from these two messages to computer ITT

777
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,980
the problem is that there is no

778
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,160
requirement that you get businesses with

779
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,470
two type of messages in the same packets

780
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,629
and an permutation could just send two

781
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:07,859
different packets with one with a hello

782
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:12,289
and another one with high and it might

783
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:14,848
case we can we cannot measure any entity

784
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:18,020
so the reference implementation and I

785
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:20,520
think bird also does the right thing but

786
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:29,220
nothing prevents an implementation to do

787
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:33,140
it differently so there are several

788
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:36,828
possible solutions for this so basic

789
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:41,078
we could put all time stamps in the ihq

790
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:42,519
messages so that it's self

791
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:46,210
self-sufficient

792
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:49,250
the main problem if we do that is that

793
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:52,660
we would we would copy a time stamp

794
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:58,059
several times in different ihe messages

795
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:58,058
so it's a lot of per packet hope ahead

796
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:06,980
and that's over two ways to do that

797
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,869
Judis provided in another solution which

798
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:12,680
will be to send timestamp in a separate

799
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:17,150
TV that does not depend on hello

800
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:19,669
so you could we could require that if

801
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:26,019
you solve an IH will time stamp you also

802
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:28,369
send miss new TV and then there's just

803
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:30,919
another version which is to say that if

804
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:34,099
you implement this extension you just

805
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,279
have to - send a hello with each eye

806
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:42,920
each you so that we don't have this

807
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:45,140
problem so I don't know if it's if it's

808
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,509
very clear do you have any any input

809
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:51,879
comments

810
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:55,099
David's classy I like the alternative

811
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,960
solution that way we don't have to break

812
00:49:55,099 --> 00:50:00,799
our e because this is deployed in

813
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,170
production and now that we have a

814
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:05,210
unicast hellos I think that's also like

815
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,589
pretty easy in case that you're running

816
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:26,180
over unicast so that's what I would

817
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:28,880
personally recommend okay yes right so

818
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:35,660
I'm not I didn't actually catch what it

819
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:38,450
was that Bobby avid was recommending the

820
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,879
alternative solution which at the bottom

821
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,470
of the slide which is

822
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,599
anytime you say none I heard you and

823
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,930
you're using this extension also send a

824
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:51,349
hell yeah okay so I was going to suggest

825
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:54,919
another breaking change which is in

826
00:50:51,349 --> 00:51:02,630
nanosecond resolution time stamps so

827
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:04,339
while we're breaking things however more

828
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:07,759
serious it doesn't have to be breaking

829
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:09,410
because we could define both and then it

830
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:21,680
can be and there's no one but that makes

831
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:30,440
the other help even bigger so it's it so

832
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:33,019
it's a did you talk to Dave yeah but

833
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,680
your to Dave Todd by the way just to

834
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:38,569
clarify yeah that's so then the second

835
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,379
resolution is nice but is very use case

836
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:44,239
for it and are you it lives difficult to

837
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,739
measure like to attempt some with a good

838
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,960
enough resolution that it would be

839
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:50,390
useful like if you do this little

840
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,920
something is using in userspace you

841
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,910
wouldn't get a nano second position I

842
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,319
guess nobody you can get better than

843
00:51:54,910 --> 00:52:00,348
microsecond resolution so this is sort

844
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:02,749
of like the use cases you can have the

845
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:06,289
protocol show you the fastest way

846
00:52:02,749 --> 00:52:09,859
through your data center by RT T so it's

847
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:14,690
sort of a different use case and I'm not

848
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:19,700
sure like I don't have a deployed use

849
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:24,819
case for it right now but like there's

850
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,819
some interesting things happening with

851
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:30,739
pace networking and you can sort of put

852
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:32,598
timestamps into the hardware and have to

853
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:35,719
eat the ethernet device paste them out

854
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:38,569
so I think it might be feasible to

855
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:41,269
actually have needs the lower

856
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:43,130
granularity at some point and it would

857
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:47,328
be a shame if we define this as a

858
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:50,769
standard and we cannot do this so it's

859
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:50,769
more sort of from from that perspective

860
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,430
another issue because the tension

861
00:52:54,610 --> 00:53:00,040
currently is in 32 bits yeah that would

862
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:03,879
have to be the congestion yeah you would

863
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,820
have five four seconds yeah reply to a

864
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,290
message so probably something in between

865
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:13,020
nanosecond and microsecond would be nice

866
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:15,430
yeah be visible or just a bigger field

867
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:22,320
sorry could you find another buyer yeah

868
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:22,319
because it yeah maybe she's like Julius

869
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,150
is that if you want to be able to

870
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:40,390
interpret an IH u timestamp you need to

871
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:43,360
have a hello at the same packet so it's

872
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:56,200
not quite correct that being the

873
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:58,750
implementation if you have two new

874
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,770
features which are unicast heavens and

875
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:04,750
unscheduled heavens which I think

876
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:06,880
problem if people think they don't solve

877
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:09,310
the problem that we can define a new Tod

878
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,430
that you can send at any time with the

879
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:17,980
wrong view to send a blank stamp without

880
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:20,799
attaching it to hello we don't currently

881
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:23,980
have any use cases and we deployed use

882
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,050
cases for microsecond resolution the

883
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:29,260
initial version of the extension a long

884
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:31,870
long time ago actually used 20 seconds

885
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,000
hundredths of a second they put some

886
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:38,319
pressure on us to switch to microseconds

887
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,400
we have I would really like to see any

888
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:44,290
convincing worst case before we switch

889
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,080
to nanoseconds and if we switch to

890
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:49,690
nanoseconds then we need to have 48 bit

891
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,330
timestamps as that is pointed out and

892
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:55,420
then we need to do 48 but cosmetics and

893
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:57,610
that complicates the implementation so

894
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,280
it's not a big deal but I think we

895
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:02,600
should have any convincing use case

896
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:06,610
before we do that

897
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,610
[Music]

898
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:23,520
yeah that's fair enough and I think it

899
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:29,490
would also be possible to add it in

900
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:31,619
later if we define the base if we define

901
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:34,859
the base extension which in all ways at

902
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:38,490
a another field for higher resolution

903
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:40,470
either just like add some more bits that

904
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:43,169
is the fraction of microseconds in a

905
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:45,540
separate TLV or define a an alternative

906
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:49,290
one that does the same thing but with a

907
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:51,509
different resolution so it's not sort of

908
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,730
a big deal and I kind of agree that it's

909
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:57,000
probably a good idea to not break the

910
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:59,010
deployed base so we already have one

911
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,380
flag day four so specific on battle day

912
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:05,579
right so if we were going to make a flag

913
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:08,040
day for this it would not be able to

914
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:10,560
make it into the same release or so it

915
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:36,450
would be a separate flag day which I

916
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:48,119
think we should avoid timestamps and

917
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:49,799
then replicate the old one so for me

918
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:53,250
basically if we if we break

919
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:56,849
compatibility because of what's written

920
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:59,730
on this tied to social one assertion to

921
00:56:56,849 --> 00:57:02,160
where we can also break it to change the

922
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:04,770
reservation but if we go with the

923
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,480
attentive solution to just require that

924
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:11,130
you should send a header even I hear you

925
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,730
then let's not break it just for the

926
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,730
reservation

927
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,700
yeah I'm just nodding so I agree let's

928
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:23,760
try to solve this without breaking

929
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:26,368
anything and then add more resolution to

930
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,910
the time staff afterwards when we have a

931
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:34,140
use case not fine

932
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:37,020
good odd days can assi just question for

933
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,490
batiste since you proposed the three

934
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,410
solutions and you're the author what's

935
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:45,629
your personal preference as they are

936
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:48,720
tonight assertion because sorry the last

937
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:50,430
one the item situation because you're

938
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:55,410
cute Rocio has no change to the

939
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:59,669
implementation and and it's it's just

940
00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:01,200
simpler so yeah so that's one house

941
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:12,119
owners sounds like a lot of us are in

942
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:16,078
agreement okay okay I guess we could

943
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:17,460
take the is it appear that there's a no

944
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,700
people in favor of that though we should

945
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:24,690
decide to confirm it on the list I see

946
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:27,359
some thumbs up here so so people can who

947
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:30,470
don't like that should complain and I'll

948
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:40,170
post a messenger asking about it okay

949
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:43,859
great thank you okay Barbara say

950
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:46,170
something I just wanted to mention when

951
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:49,589
we had that info model we mentioned that

952
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:51,690
are the RTT draft needed to identify any

953
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:54,089
parameters that it would need for

954
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:56,029
example I think we've already sort of

955
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:59,038
discussed that it would probably add a

956
00:58:56,029 --> 00:59:05,039
would it be an RTT boolean in the

957
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:08,839
interface object and i guess i can

958
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:11,160
propose that on the list yeah yeah so

959
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:12,359
basically the in the reference

960
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,690
implementation we have several

961
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:17,400
parameters so the first one is do we

962
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:20,220
want to some time stamps on this

963
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,289
interface because it consumes some

964
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:27,660
amount of packet space or you may want

965
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:28,829
to disable it then there are some

966
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:33,190
parameters

967
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:37,020
so maybe you can go to slide eight or

968
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:41,049
nine something so when yes this one no

969
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:44,740
next one yes so basically you can

970
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:49,299
confuse a minute Emacs 30min cost which

971
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:51,359
is actually the average cost unix cost

972
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:55,089
it's a it's already very in Babel and

973
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:57,730
mexico's which is only one so with this

974
00:59:55,089 --> 01:00:02,049
metric it's there's a set of new

975
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:03,460
parameters to add to some other okay

976
01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:05,230
that's good I think we should have a

977
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:08,440
section in the document that kind of

978
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:10,750
specifically talks about information

979
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:18,480
model needed okay and therefore you up

980
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:25,559
to date on these but I I can read okay

981
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:25,559
are there any further comments here

982
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,558
there's a note here

983
01:00:37,450 --> 01:01:04,819
okay so that's the end of the regular

984
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:10,549
