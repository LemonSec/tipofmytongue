[Music]

2
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:48,899
multiple people duck no oh no that I

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:54,870
downloaded from I kind of me

4
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:58,559
already yet okay so blue sheets are

5
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,229
wandering around sign him I could Kara's

6
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,890
missing in action I have no idea what's

7
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:08,670
going on how many of you have never seen

8
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:25,829
into Walt's life okay so you all know

9
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:34,979
what that's up let me talk real briefly

10
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:41,399
about the agenda we have invited and

11
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:44,969
that's what we're doing with the invited

12
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,700
talks those four years I hope you're

13
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:51,658
familiar with but basically trying to

14
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,679
target ideally people that are playing I

15
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,679
six only

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:05,700
okay ideal example bitter turning off IP

17
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,409
before deploying Isaac only to get their

18
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,360
experience you know where's the rug

19
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:14,910
where does the shoot not set and when we

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,670
can't get that we've been asking people

21
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,739
to simply talk about their ipv6 20

22
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,079
where's the rug where's the shooter on

23
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:36,500
set so Andrews going to talk about

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:41,150
liquid telecom this point so there are

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:44,160
well actually so Barbara is taking notes

26
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,980
if somebody could be a jabber strike I

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,959
would very much appreciate that seeing

28
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,709
no my hands okay so Eric will be

29
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,420
generous right so we've got two internet

30
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,370
drafts that we've been working on in

31
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,640
this working group and we'll see where

32
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,010
that goes and then Arabic cabs any draft

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,510
that is about to go into working group

34
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,160
last call and off set and they asked

35
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:15,328
basically to get feedback commentary

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,600
from v6 pops in that context so so give

37
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:21,540
him an opportunity to talk if we have

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,510
time I have three other drafts where

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,138
people have come to humbugs chairs under

40
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:31,638
on tonight and they asked for time and I

41
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:38,150
haven't seen mailing list discussion

42
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:42,090
about them in one case in two years and

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:45,959
so if we have time spent then we'll give

44
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,790
them or if they don't have time I'm

45
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,930
sorry you know that's the way it's gonna

46
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,269
be but we have the slides and we can

47
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,889
give them before we turn that would be

48
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,769
kind of the nature of whitening clock

49
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,639
it'll be a ten minute as opposed to get

50
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:06,049
an hour just to comment that the last

51
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,049
one the title is wrong

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,930
place your thoughts here enough

53
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:17,019
okay you're right a nice duplicated

54
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:23,260
death okay I screwed them just all my

55
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:26,500
god I'll change this but yeah so Harry

56
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:30,430
that's what's going on does anybody want

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,240
to dash the agenda you have changes you

58
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:48,220
would like to make them okay fine with

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:51,580
that then Andrew now you're gonna find

60
00:04:48,220 --> 00:05:01,660
this one far more usable because that's

61
00:04:51,580 --> 00:05:04,539
connected to the wrong computer yeah I

62
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,220
think you can hear me here so firstly

63
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,500
thanks very much for having me

64
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,020
actually my first IETF and it's it's

65
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,729
quite an honor to be here but yeah

66
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,680
thanks for having us I'm gonna talk a

67
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,200
little bit about our v6 deployment today

68
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,280
and the challenges that we're facing and

69
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:25,090
some of our solutions to them I think

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,700
that a lot of what I've seen in the

71
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:32,530
lists etc is focusing on getting v6 to

72
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:34,180
the end-user and we've found that the

73
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,309
challenges to doing that are actually

74
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,680
more related to our backbone and I'll

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,090
cover that but it's a it's a bit of a

76
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,740
different perspective from what I've

77
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:49,030
seen on the lists and yeah let's jump

78
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,290
into it so who is liquid and just to

79
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,320
give you a bit of an idea of the scale

80
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,930
of a network we run Africa's largest

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:01,000
fiber network 70,000 kilometers covering

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,340
16 countries probably about 12,000 MPLS

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,360
nodes on the network it's a large

84
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,739
network and we try and stay at the

85
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,630
bleeding edge because it gives us a

86
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,710
competitive advantage particularly with

87
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,400
the fact that we're not dealing with a

88
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,049
lot of legacy text so we get to leapfrog

89
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,750
and kind of leave their tech behind

90
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,890
which has its advantages

91
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,240
also means if you're playing on the

92
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,700
bleeding edge well sometimes you're

93
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,920
going to bleed and hopefully not too

94
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:33,909
much so our current v6 deployment

95
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,480
highlights we started our v6 Road many

96
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,210
years back with one customer in Zambia

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,850
and we deployed it across the backbone

98
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,789
for that one customer because liquid has

99
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,870
never bought a transit in Africa so we

100
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,750
needed to take it all the way through

101
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,470
the backbone in order to get it there

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,810
anyway we switched our backbone to

103
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,450
single topology mode six years ago the

104
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,280
motivation go was simple the engineers

105
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,900
would forget to put v6 there because

106
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,000
while it was the second-class citizen so

107
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,409
you in for single topology well that

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,470
doesn't work if it's not there and it

109
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,770
helps that really actually had quite a

110
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,290
profound effect on our v6 deployment we

111
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,990
then rolled out v6 in Zimbabwe on our

112
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,840
cheap on network which to our knowledge

113
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,360
is still only major v6 deployment in

114
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,940
Zimbabwe and it was the first country on

115
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,450
the Google map to actually kind of show

116
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,919
any movement and it got us to about a

117
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,310
five point nine three percent adoption

118
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,719
in the country which was a nice step

119
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,479
forward it would be a lot higher but

120
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,210
keep in mind that internet in Africa is

121
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:43,270
incredibly mobile based and the mobile

122
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,000
providers well they're not exactly

123
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:49,810
moving very fast in the v6 world in

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,390
Africa a new Jeep on network in Tanzania

125
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,610
which is only two weeks old built on the

126
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,919
same model and we are hoping that as

127
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:01,440
that grows we will start to see some

128
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,820
movement there now our challenges

129
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,370
because that slide unfortunately was

130
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,750
where the good news ends so now we get

131
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,180
to talk about some of the bad news and

132
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:15,040
some of the solutions that we are using

133
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:19,479
to deal with it so why did things in our

134
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:22,120
v6 deployment stall firstly our customer

135
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:27,090
base is incredibly enterprise centric

136
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,010
and they are very net centric and

137
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:34,389
convincing customers to move from what

138
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,630
they know and trust is not easy

139
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:41,889
we also find that net is actively sold

140
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,750
in Africa as a security mechanism and to

141
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:45,639
the point where customers go but you're

142
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,930
taking away my net you can daddy secure

143
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:53,050
my network and it's not true but we are

144
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,420
fighting a disinformation campaign on a

145
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,510
constant basis on this and it does not

146
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,949
make things easy until recently there's

147
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,899
almost no movement on the mobile

148
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:05,469
providers we are now seeing it with

149
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:07,930
Safaricom in Kenya the the predominant

150
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,940
mobile provider who started to do some

151
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,560
v6 the mobile network in the su2 and if

152
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,199
I get time I'll tell a funny story about

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,560
how that one actually came to happen it

154
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:23,019
was quite a bizarre story we're also

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,119
seeing some movement in Gabon which is

156
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,889
Vivendi but again it's an international

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,350
operator it's not an african-led

158
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:34,120
deployment what's happening in Gabon and

159
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,350
that is kind of worrying me because I'm

160
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,079
not seeing much movement from the

161
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,459
African operators themselves we've also

162
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,459
had some major vendor challenges

163
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,229
particularly in the cpe side if you

164
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,209
control all your CPEs this is easy

165
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,680
you've got one standard CPE when people

166
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,869
are bringing their own CP ease you've

167
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,779
got a problem and when it comes to Jeep

168
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:57,399
on the ont support that we've seen out

169
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:02,680
there for v6 is her illness it is it is

170
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:09,370
really really bad but to talk about our

171
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:12,638
challenges in Africa we have a challenge

172
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,220
whereby we have to be able to steer our

173
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,380
traffic at a moment's notice

174
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,050
governments in Africa have a habit of

175
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,839
doing very strange things and deciding

176
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,180
well you can't have Facebook your kind

177
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,040
of whatsapp and that means that you get

178
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,199
to the inland countries I need to be

179
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,269
able to click something and say divert

180
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,300
this traffic from this source to this

181
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:37,930
destination around this country I cannot

182
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,370
spend hours building manual te tunnels

183
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,219
etc this is a problem and the lack of

184
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,209
feature parity with MPLS and some of the

185
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,990
stuff we're seeing in

186
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:53,290
v4 is actually creating some fairly

187
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,059
significant challenges in our deployment

188
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,519
of v6 in those countries because I

189
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:59,170
cannot guarantee the same quality of

190
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,139
service because I don't have the same

191
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:05,709
level of control that I get on v4

192
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:08,160
because of MPLS feature parity we see

193
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,878
some very inconsistent vendor

194
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,550
implementations and this is interesting

195
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,139
there's one particular vendor who when

196
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,349
you order your hardware if you say I

197
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,600
want v6 with it it costs you nothing if

198
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,670
you forget to say that and you asked him

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,339
24 hours later after you've given them

200
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,610
the check you will get an invoice that

201
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,619
says it almost the cost of the router

202
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,160
you do not forget to ask if you've got

203
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:35,649
legacy equipment from that vendor you

204
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,519
have a problem deploying v6 because it's

205
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,649
going to cost you a lot of money why not

206
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,300
just replace that window well there are

207
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:47,170
certain countries in Africa where

208
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:50,679
bringing some vendors is problematic

209
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,618
because of export restrictions and other

210
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,720
such things so you are left with certain

211
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:56,889
vendors where they are your only option

212
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,679
I will leave the rest to your

213
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:05,519
imagination you also have a lack of

214
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:08,259
consistency PEO implementations that

215
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,420
cause problems and it's the reason why

216
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:14,139
we do static v6 on japon networks

217
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,809
because the whole array in the issues on

218
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:20,559
dynamic v6 caused us absolute nightmares

219
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:22,209
in many many cases and then on the

220
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,480
translation mechanisms when we wanna go

221
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:28,589
v6 I mean which one there's how many v6

222
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:32,470
translation mechanisms are they and

223
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:38,410
there are a lot of them right now map a

224
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:41,319
map TBS light 464xlat that data and the

225
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,449
problem with us is the fact that when

226
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:46,628
you put a multitude of CPE Z in play

227
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:50,319
here who supports what actually becomes

228
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:51,910
a little bit challenging I'll talk a

229
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:55,870
little bit about that but it's let's

230
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,870
talk first about the MPLS challenges we

231
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,420
need to be able to steer an engineer

232
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,070
traffic

233
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,110
and in the African environment when

234
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,670
you're working across 17 countries where

235
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,270
you don't know what's gonna happen

236
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,329
tomorrow where you've got a constantly

237
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,880
shifting environment where potentially

238
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,910
you can't buy a high-capacity circuit so

239
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,310
you have to start balancing traffic

240
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,439
because for whatever reason the provider

241
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,650
where you can't build long haul say

242
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,040
you've got to use STM sixteens in some

243
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:31,400
cases you've got to have that ability to

244
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,860
engineer traffic all of the engineering

245
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,310
tends to be fairly heavily MPLS based

246
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,950
and we found that that lack of feature

247
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:44,239
parity has really really caused us quite

248
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,310
a bit of problems do I like the fact

249
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,500
that we have to do that no but it's a

250
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,079
practical reality of working in the

251
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,220
environment in which we operate we need

252
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,080
those features now we're using a lot of

253
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,530
SR MPLS we've been doing that for about

254
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,720
a year and a half and it's worked very

255
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:05,390
very well for us in many many cases

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,340
unfortunately when you get to certain

257
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:10,220
countries where you are running the

258
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:13,070
vendors that you have to use they're

259
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,960
because of the political reasons you

260
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:19,040
find that they've decided randomly that

261
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,430
they're not going to support ipv6 with

262
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,680
this or MPLS at all it's just not there

263
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,410
and they won't even discuss it with you

264
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,089
they just go well you'll use s or v6 but

265
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,579
then the other vendors that you're using

266
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,670
elsewhere don't support s or v6 yet and

267
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,880
of course you you end up with a problem

268
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,800
we have a rather interesting solution to

269
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,240
this problem though that I will talk

270
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,400
about later that we've been testing in

271
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,160
order to do the end-to-end traffic

272
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,750
control and steering as I said there are

273
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,290
islands of this hardware that doesn't

274
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,030
support us or MPLS and there's a bit of

275
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,390
a solution

276
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:01,400
there are also some fairly major

277
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:04,370
challenges with regards to BGP labelled

278
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,730
unicast and keep in mind that we

279
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,589
consider LD p6 a stillborn child it LD

280
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:14,120
p6 just never really happened that means

281
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:17,190
if we're doing MPLS with v6 it is SR and

282
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,319
SR and BGP labeled unit cost in the

283
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,509
absence of LDP done always play so

284
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:23,339
nicely together you get random label

285
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,009
insertions and other funny things across

286
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:29,579
all of the vendors so you have some

287
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:32,069
issues over there we've largely managed

288
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:34,979
to work around them primarily what we

289
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:37,740
see is the fact that it introduces an

290
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,240
extra label onto the stack with a random

291
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,889
label that it generates and in lo label

292
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,329
devices we've only got three labels to

293
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:52,889
work with this will cause us problems

294
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:55,769
so we've had to work around that on the

295
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,959
vendor implementation side our traffic

296
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:01,680
control in our steering is heavily

297
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:05,369
heavily BGP link-state we use a lot of

298
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,489
link state without controllers and the

299
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,529
implementations from the vendors around

300
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:14,029
BGP link state it's all there in the RF

301
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:16,769
sees that the TVs are there everything

302
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:18,360
unfortunately the v6 he'll he's in most

303
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:22,680
food in a lot of the vendors are just

304
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,600
well missing I just don't show up and so

305
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,008
that's a problem but we're working with

306
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
the vendors on that and saying please

307
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,699
you know we need a consistent

308
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,769
implementation here but it does create

309
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:35,370
problems with our entire traffic

310
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:39,750
steering chain the support for v6 on

311
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:42,569
low-end CPEs is as inconsistent as it

312
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,529
comes I mean it is it is a mess out

313
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:48,000
there you you name the CPE and I mean I

314
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,550
think I've got a cupboard at home of

315
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,769
about 50 different CPEs which we went

316
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,859
through testing one by one by one by one

317
00:16:52,769 --> 00:17:00,089
and every report is inconsistent it was

318
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,000
it was quite bad and so that's created

319
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:06,230
some some issues the other thing is dpi

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,419
the DPI supports the traffic through v6

321
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:13,049
is getting better but it has been

322
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:16,650
extremely patchy and classification of

323
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:19,020
traffic again I don't like dpi we prefer

324
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,030
not to run dpi unfortunately in certain

325
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,359
segments of the network it is a

326
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:30,928
necessity and so problems with dpi on

327
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:33,590
v6 traffic have caused us some issues on

328
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,240
our translation mechanisms at the moment

329
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,129
it's looking like we are veering towards

330
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,230
the s wife because it's supported by all

331
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,429
our cheap on our n T's it's the one

332
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,649
thing that is and I know that there are

333
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,570
a lot of people who are going but why

334
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:52,080
not map you why not map T why not this

335
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,210
one at that you know in our testing with

336
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,549
what we've got on the network this is

337
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,889
just a practical you know it's a

338
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:01,470
practical decision this is what we see

339
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:03,678
is the most supported in the technology

340
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,600
that we have on the network

341
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,639
no no religious preference I don't do

342
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,879
religion I do what works and consulting

343
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:13,949
my customers you know what I mean but at

344
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,380
the moment we've also still got v4 space

345
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,389
so our preference is still just to do

346
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,210
all stack it week until we run out of v4

347
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:24,209
space we're in the lucky position where

348
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:30,360
we still have v4 afrinic still has some

349
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:33,809
v4 how long that lasts for well we'll

350
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,320
wait and see you know so we'll do all

351
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:39,480
stat but we are in no ways putting on a

352
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,519
back seat the translation mechanisms and

353
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,100
our exploration and we are actively

354
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:55,429
working on that and testing out the

355
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:55,428
options so the solutions that we've got

356
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:07,980
on the ESO MPLS and steering the traffic

357
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:13,049
assort MPLS is our preferred method for

358
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,820
solving our MPLS issues however most of

359
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,980
the MPLS protocols particularly fell

360
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,678
through circuit extensions very heavily

361
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,799
LD be tied store mattina contella even

362
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,899
l3 VPN you can't turn up an LV VPN with

363
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,149
v6 without some form of v4 underlay

364
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,989
don't ask me why that is because it

365
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:34,590
should be bgp signaled but it just is

366
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:37,970
you need that local v4 address now we

367
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,949
see some hope with a VPN and a VPN vp w

368
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,780
for circuit extensions etc because that

369
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,940
does just work and it works on an

370
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:49,220
assault backplane as well then on those

371
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,800
islands I talked about so actually it

372
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:58,100
was this week and I read some p4 code to

373
00:19:51,800 --> 00:20:00,710
test this we need to kind of skip over

374
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,699
these islands but maintain into in

375
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,980
traffic control so I might get told I'm

376
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,520
completely insane here but what we've

377
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:14,600
been looking at is using a binding label

378
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,340
on the SR stack of labels and steering

379
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,409
it to the edge of the network and using

380
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,480
that binding label to pop off the

381
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:24,530
binding label and then effectively push

382
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,700
a v6 stack onto the package with a seat

383
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,690
with a compressed routing header

384
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,580
destination option in there and then

385
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,880
using stock standard routing to the

386
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,909
other side pop off the v6 header again

387
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,710
push the traffic back on and use BGP

388
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,210
signaling in between to signal the

389
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,350
labels across it which means that you

390
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,360
can skip over the island which will

391
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,110
solve one of our problems it's a one of

392
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:54,770
the more extreme solutions but it does

393
00:20:50,110 --> 00:21:00,189
potentially solve a problem we also

394
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:03,200
believe that SR v6 is coming we have

395
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:07,220
quite a number of concerns with standard

396
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,490
SR v6 though and with regards to address

397
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,200
overloading wastage of v6 base and yes

398
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,770
that is actually a concern when you look

399
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,920
at the volumes of it and so we've kind

400
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:21,020
of got involved in we know what we need

401
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,150
here so we're working in the spring

402
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,840
working group to say you know this is

403
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,220
our perspective and see where it goes

404
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,610
our preference is always going to be s

405
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,920
our MPLS but we know that certain

406
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,530
vendors are not going to support v6 on S

407
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,530
or MPLS so we need to ensure that

408
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:43,250
whatever option does come out of that

409
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:48,879
works for us in the absence of that not

410
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:50,740
ideal but it is what it is then another

411
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,320
challenges and solutions on the link

412
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,590
state problems we're working with the

413
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,179
vendors we've seen some success but we

414
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,909
augment through other data sources if

415
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,670
necessary not ideal but functional on

416
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,680
dpi it's getting a lot better we've been

417
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,680
banging on the vendors doors for a long

418
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,780
time and you know like twice a day fix

419
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,720
this fix this fix this and it seems the

420
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,530
harassment seems to be working

421
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,060
we've also because of the

422
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,649
inconsistencies in implementation

423
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,470
changed the procurement models that we

424
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,780
buy Britta's under we now say here are a

425
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,260
list of RFC's that you have to support

426
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:30,310
if you deviate from this or if she in

427
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,170
any paragraph tell us where you tell us

428
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,720
why and tell us when you're going to fix

429
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,460
it and if you don't comply with it I

430
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,850
reserve the right to return the hard way

431
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,480
when I find out about it it's actually

432
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,480
worked quite well

433
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,110
uuugh you'd be surprised at how honest

434
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,699
vendors come when there's a clause in

435
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,260
there that says I will return the two

436
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,750
million dollars with a hardware if you

437
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,900
lie to me yeah and particularly since

438
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,880
we've done it once

439
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,610
you know so you change the procurement

440
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,620
level and it puts pressure and it does

441
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,840
seem to have worked quite well you also

442
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,090
find that suddenly you get a new code

443
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,340
release that fixes the incompatibility

444
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,340
quite particularly on the bigger orders

445
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:25,480
so moving down the track we're busy v6

446
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,370
enabling some consumer networks in

447
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,500
Uganda Rwanda Zambia and Kenya some of

448
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,719
that stuff will start showing up fairly

449
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:38,260
quickly some of it is more problematic

450
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,850
because of Jeep on Ont is that aren't

451
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,660
working on the vendors we're working

452
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:45,939
with in Tanzania and and Zimbabwe and

453
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,440
we've got some issues there but it's

454
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,440
something that's actively being worked

455
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,480
on we've within the last week launched a

456
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,480
new network in South Sudan which goes

457
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,210
effectively from Kenya to Uganda and up

458
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,299
into South Sudan and obviously there's a

459
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,279
lot of traffic

460
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:06,109
issues when you start talking South

461
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,969
Sudan and Uganda in the middle because

462
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:12,139
there's some interesting politics there

463
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:14,629
but we're doing it anyway and that will

464
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:16,549
be v6 enabled from day one using all the

465
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:19,339
SR technologies to deal with some of the

466
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:22,789
problems our investigation on the

467
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:24,469
translation mechanisms continues but

468
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:27,200
we've got some room to move because

469
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:29,299
we've still got v4 space and it's not

470
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,690
taking a back seat but it does take some

471
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,579
pressure off us and then we'll continue

472
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,169
working in the spring working group and

473
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:38,259
hopefully we'll get to the point where

474
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:43,419
we do feel that we've got enough parity

475
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:47,029
to really do what we need to do we are

476
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:50,299
getting bidding the house on SR to solve

477
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:53,719
a lot of our problems no denying that

478
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:55,549
it's just a question of where the SR

479
00:24:53,719 --> 00:25:01,969
debates go it's it's going to be very

480
00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:04,820
interesting to see and then by policy we

481
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:07,070
now deploy v6 towards every client on

482
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,479
the interface there's a 64 on the

483
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,619
interface and a 48 routed to the

484
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:11,299
interface and we don't care if you don't

485
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:12,379
use it we will try and get you to use it

486
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,839
but if you don't it's there it's

487
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:18,619
deployed it's allocated in our systems

488
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,239
and we'll tell you about it but every

489
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:22,458
client we're now putting it on there

490
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:25,519
sadly getting them to actually use it as

491
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:28,940
a problem but we deploy it by default

492
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:32,059
and we you know there's just no option

493
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,950
for it it hasn't had much of an effect

494
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,389
sadly because it gets to the edge and

495
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,959
well the customers don't do anything

496
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:41,178
with it then we'll in launching some

497
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:44,359
fairly major v6 awareness campaigns

498
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:46,279
fairly shortly and we're using a

499
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,168
platform that we've got 21c skills

500
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:51,440
initiatives which we're trying to use to

501
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:53,109
train people in Africa and this will

502
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,839
consist of training videos white papers

503
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:59,718
promotional materials etc and we'll

504
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:02,418
continue to try and dispel the myth of

505
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:04,070
security by now we are looking at

506
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:07,429
potentially doing cloud-based

507
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,649
firewalling to the DIA customers etc to

508
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,690
say you know what get ready on that will

509
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:13,549
push your v6 through a firewall and you

510
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,070
don't have to pay for it but we'll do

511
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:17,810
that to protect you against the

512
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,450
that net is protecting you and will

513
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,429
still get very your net will get your v6

514
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,160
so that's one of the initiative you know

515
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:28,190
the initiatives but that's a little bit

516
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,910
about you know a quick brief on what

517
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:41,780
we're doing and yeah hopefully somebody

518
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:43,670
finds like useful so thanks very much if

519
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,920
anyone's got any questions just grab me

520
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,780
off to absorb Jordy Paulette I have the

521
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,670
feeling I am not really sure but I have

522
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,740
the feeling that when you mention

523
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:58,400
translation mekinese you actually want

524
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,140
to say transition in general yes sorry

525
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,690
that's that great that's some confusion

526
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,810
at the beginning one of the points that

527
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:07,190
you mention about the CPE support for

528
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,370
the for the transition mechanism

529
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:13,910
specially for ipv6 only an ipv4 as a

530
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:15,770
service you may not know but about three

531
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:21,080
months ago this working group got

532
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:24,260
through RFC 8585 which is probably what

533
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,990
you should ask to your vendors for new

534
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,270
filter updates or new equipment or so on

535
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,940
so you have all the choices depending

536
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:36,290
even if the vendors if the customers buy

537
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,450
the CPE outside yeah cool that thank you

538
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:42,550
that's that's actually good I didn't

539
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,550
know that and it's something to look at

540
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,449
hi my name is so much jewellery from

541
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,820
feature a a great presentation thank you

542
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,170
so much I have one question regarding

543
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:01,610
the one of the slides you mentioned

544
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:05,090
there are routers where you cannot push

545
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:06,709
more than three labels for you know so

546
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,149
you see a lot of that equipment because

547
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,040
that's generally we see in cell site

548
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,040
routers the routers have small in

549
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,389
backhaul there you can use Broadcom

550
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,220
chips you cannot put for more than four

551
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,250
layers it's it's it's a general case for

552
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,950
uro how is it we see a lot of that

553
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:26,530
particularly down at the edge and we see

554
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:29,800
that in some of the aggregation stuff we

555
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:33,070
we hit the three label limitation and we

556
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,500
need to traffic steer we do that through

557
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,290
the controllers using SR and binding

558
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,240
labels and effectively bind the label

559
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:44,889
and switch out the stack at intermediate

560
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,770
Ori points to lower the number of labels

561
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,080
on the stack at any one point that works

562
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,820
quite well in a completely controller

563
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,990
based environment where you can automate

564
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,120
it mm-hmm

565
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,830
if you are not automating that though

566
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,489
and you've got that amount of stitching

567
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,560
happening

568
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:03,490
it's a non-story you will lose track of

569
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,139
it everywhere you also do have a couple

570
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,500
of challenges there with regards to

571
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,570
enter in path testing etc and we had to

572
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,230
do some quite interesting stuff on the

573
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,350
operational side to do into end s or

574
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,940
path testing where we're injecting

575
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,949
packets that have labels that take it to

576
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,450
the head end user binding label to take

577
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,830
that packet through the tunnel and back

578
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,350
to the controller and then measure

579
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:29,530
whether or not the packets arriving back

580
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,300
and packet loss etc because it gets

581
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,040
quite interesting testing whether a path

582
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,540
is alive once you've injected it with

583
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,250
bgp but that worked quite well three is

584
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,840
really small number you have VPN labeled

585
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,520
easy PLU after that you have only one

586
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,010
label that is LDP then you have to

587
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,440
replace it bindings it now yes it does

588
00:29:45,010 --> 00:30:00,790
it gets it gets a little bit interesting

589
00:29:47,440 --> 00:30:05,070
and certainly and I'm around all week if

590
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,070
anyone has anything else Thanks

591
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:36,080
you make it fullscreen yeah look at all

592
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,900
right no not gonna comfort we wanna be

593
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,330
able to see oh it's okay that's okay I

594
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:45,160
think I can I can move through without

595
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:48,620
going to the middle of the screen okay

596
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,080
this document was was presented for the

597
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:54,590
first time in the in the last IDF in in

598
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:58,490
prac alejandra which is the co out or

599
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:00,709
actually he's online in Argentina he

600
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,290
come to the list which problem hey I am

601
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:07,220
willing to deploy for six Forex Latin my

602
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:10,040
broadband network but when I do cgn I

603
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,400
can optimize the traffic to the caches

604
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,560
to the city ends and so on that I can

605
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,840
not do that which for six Forex lat so

606
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,710
there is any way to find a solution so

607
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,449
we started working on that that's

608
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,810
basically the problem statement of

609
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:30,530
course with cgn this only works for

610
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:34,070
those Syrians or caches that are able to

611
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:37,760
use the private addresses special for

612
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:41,570
the cgn right so it's range 100 dot 64

613
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:46,030
dot 0 dot 0 / 10 if they cannot

614
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:49,520
accommodate to that it's also useless so

615
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:53,810
this is the typical 4 6 for excellent

616
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:56,000
deployment where you may have the not 64

617
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:59,720
and the connection to to internet and

618
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:06,110
then you have the 80 v6 internet if in

619
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:09,440
addition to that you have Syrians if you

620
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,929
have connection to Syrians and just a

621
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,790
note here we started this document

622
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,880
sinking in Syrians but actually who

623
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:19,430
realize it that is useful for any ipv6 a

624
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,290
naval service so if you have CD ends

625
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:27,919
here ops that course to first yeah

626
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:30,260
we're on Boonton this one if you have

627
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,929
the Sirians here and you have here an

628
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:36,410
ipv6 enabled device you take advantage

629
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:40,760
of this flow right of this n to n which

630
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:44,000
ipv6 the problem is when you have for

631
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,440
example a Smart TV or a set-top box

632
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,260
which typically is not yet ipv6 enabled

633
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,450
what is going to happen is that even if

634
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,520
this device here the CDN or the catch

635
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:59,690
air whatever is dualistic

636
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:03,440
the flow will be truly not 64 so you are

637
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:05,360
doing an ipv4 to ipv6 and then again PPD

638
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,640
for translation which don't make sense

639
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,799
and this is something common in other

640
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,799
transition mechanism for example map T

641
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,470
is having also the same problem okay so

642
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,070
in fact even again the original document

643
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,140
was thinking in for 6 for X that this is

644
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,360
also solution for mati for this

645
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:28,190
optimization so what we are trying to do

646
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:32,209
is this one because this IP v4 only

647
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:34,460
device will get translated to ipv6 by

648
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:39,669
the silat or the nut for 6 which is the

649
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:44,480
same we want that this flow can reach

650
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:46,700
directly they ipv6 side of the dual

651
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,549
stack service ok instead of going

652
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:54,320
through the not 64 that's the idea so

653
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:57,710
how we do that

654
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,110
well this will be the picture of the

655
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,780
different scenario so we have optimal

656
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:07,370
scenario we have dual stack devices or

657
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:10,040
ipv6 enabled devices behind the CP demux

658
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:13,219
the support email will be it will use

659
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,029
the part through the not 64 and then

660
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:18,980
what we can do is again getting that

661
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:21,830
without the nuts 64 translation so we

662
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:24,619
keep the cielab translation the not for

663
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:26,750
6 translation up-to-date destination

664
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,040
which ipv6 okay

665
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:34,280
now we investigate the three approaches

666
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,349
one of them is equivalent to the cgn

667
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,419
that I mentioned before which is having

668
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:41,780
the Syrians and the catches using the

669
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:44,839
nat64

670
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,149
addressing a space so if you are able to

671
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,849
configure your Syrians with the 64

672
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:52,699
prefix that's ugly but it's the same

673
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:54,409
that we do with caraway not right so

674
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,290
that will be one possibility of course

675
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,770
some CDN or ketchup providers don't like

676
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:04,070
this they don't want to use their

677
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:06,380
interfaces they that's 64 addressing

678
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:09,020
space and it has some complexity because

679
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,210
you may be using a net were specific

680
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:15,290
graphics and of course this will only

681
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:17,060
work if decisions or HS are in the SP

682
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:20,540
network but not if they are for example

683
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,910
in an IX because the not 64 prefix is

684
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:27,800
non wettable okay

685
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:31,129
so the second approach is let's get the

686
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,940
salaat with typical ease in the CP

687
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:40,339
together with a DNS proxy to talk

688
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:43,190
together and guess if the device that is

689
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:46,730
trying to access a dual stack resource

690
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:50,960
or an ipv6 enabled resource is an ipv4

691
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:53,330
only device or application if we don't

692
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,880
succeed in that gasps nothing happens we

693
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:59,990
still don't break anything but if we do

694
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:04,130
a good guess we are able to help that

695
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:07,490
traffic flow to go end-to-end today t v6

696
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:11,450
address instead of translating twice so

697
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,580
even if we make a failure in the gas is

698
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:16,069
still not breaking anything okay that

699
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,529
has been our primary consideration with

700
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:23,440
the design of this approach so what we

701
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:26,210
do is a few steps which are detection of

702
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,450
suppose that IP before only device of

703
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,300
all or applications detection that the

704
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:35,120
destination is ipv6 enabled

705
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,750
we create explicit address mapping

706
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,819
tables for connecting those two sides

707
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:44,750
the source taping for only source quits

708
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:47,690
the ipv6 enabled destination and then we

709
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:52,180
use existing routing to forward the ipv6

710
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:55,400
traffic okay and then we have some

711
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:59,029
points based on DNS details to maintain

712
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:04,400
the the entries in the in the specific

713
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:08,350
address mapping so one example let's

714
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:12,020
suppose we have a smart TV looking for

715
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:15,319
www.example.com and it gets an a record

716
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:18,350
and even if the Smart TV because he said

717
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,860
before only is not asking for the quad a

718
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:26,170
record the city will do that okay so the

719
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:30,740
CP can guess that it's getting a query

720
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:33,950
for an a record it can infer that

721
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:37,220
probably is an ipv4 only device because

722
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:40,129
if you get a query first for the record

723
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,980
most probably is not a dual stack okay

724
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,310
again if it's not if it's a bad guess we

725
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:49,790
still don't break anything

726
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:52,340
then we create this mapping table okay

727
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:57,259
Oh mapping entry in the explicit address

728
00:37:52,340 --> 00:38:00,020
mapping table and then they're not 64 or

729
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,730
select sorry we're not for six that's

730
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,610
that's incorrect now that should be not

731
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:08,480
for six or the salaat is translated to

732
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:12,580
that address and the CDN of course has

733
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,990
the what a address so it just works okay

734
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:20,390
now let's suppose there is another

735
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:23,029
device in the same CPE that is asking

736
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,670
for a different name and this was as a

737
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,730
consequence of Martin I don't remember

738
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,290
the name but that a Czech guy that was

739
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:34,120
in the last meeting and he was saying

740
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:37,670
hey you are forgetting what we call the

741
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,730
reverse proxies reverse proxies have a

742
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,480
single ipv4 address for multiple ipv6

743
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,840
destinations

744
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,000
just do this part is not going to work

745
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,740
so in the last version of our document

746
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,010
we included something else to solve this

747
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:56,879
problem okay so the thing is that if we

748
00:38:53,010 --> 00:39:02,100
detect that another query is using the

749
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:05,760
same ipv4 address we need to discard the

750
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:08,490
optimization so in the case of reverse

751
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,220
proxies we cannot do that okay because

752
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:19,100
otherwise we may break one or the other

753
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:21,870
connection right we did a lot of

754
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,310
questioning about our procedure to make

755
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,529
sure that we are not breaking anything

756
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,930
because the the pongos let's make sure

757
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:31,680
that if you deploy ipv6 with this

758
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:33,509
optimization the CDN will be happy or

759
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,089
the service provider will be happy we

760
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,390
cannot have the risk of breaking

761
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,430
anything okay because that means the CDN

762
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,250
will disable ipv6 for that customer we

763
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:48,870
don't want to go through that so we do a

764
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:52,230
lot of points on that and then there is

765
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:54,930
a final approach which is somehow

766
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:57,450
equivalent to the automated approach in

767
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:00,839
the Salah talking with the DNS proxy

768
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:05,100
inside the CP but in this case is

769
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,400
manually configured by the ISP so there

770
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:12,860
you speak and get the ENT and send it to

771
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,270
the cities okay but of course that means

772
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,580
configuration by the operator so we

773
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:20,430
wanted to do it automatic we believe

774
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:23,759
that from the three approaches base it

775
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,529
on routing or Delta mated one or the

776
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,770
manual one from the operator at

777
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:34,050
provisioning the second one is the is

778
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:36,540
the best the best choice in addition to

779
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:40,610
that there is an interesting thing here

780
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:45,810
is that today we don't have a solution

781
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:49,560
if there is an ipv4 only device here

782
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:51,690
like a set of bugs and will happen ipv6

783
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:56,078
only service of course we could deploy

784
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:58,749
CDC right but maybe these

785
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,890
can provide an an additional solution to

786
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:07,480
that which is even if this is ipv6 only

787
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:12,598
connected if you put an a record this

788
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:17,289
will work right it's ugly but it works

789
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:22,450
so this may be a way to I do really need

790
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:24,910
CDC well not really I just create an I

791
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:27,009
record even if I don't have this box

792
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,470
connected right before because I am

793
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:38,079
never going to use that because

794
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:41,259
everything will come by ipv6 of course

795
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,559
of course but the idea is that you can

796
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:47,200
have a good page in the SP saying sorry

797
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:52,029
this service is only for ipv6 enable

798
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,788
customers okay because if you don't have

799
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:58,450
a P before the rest of the of the

800
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:00,279
customers will never reach that so we

801
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:05,399
are not creating any additional problem

802
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:14,349
right so that's the thing

803
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:17,470
thank you questions it's not just about

804
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:19,150
other names that have the same ipv4

805
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:23,019
address it's also a V before literals

806
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:25,599
right yeah it was the same yeah for

807
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:30,999
quick I didn't mention but yeah no but

808
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:33,009
like right thing is iterate entry table

809
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:35,680
you're not gonna have a DNS lookup to

810
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:38,710
notice that your EMT or whatever it is

811
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:43,029
is invalid but but then the EMT was not

812
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:48,160
created if you AMT entries created only

813
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:51,569
if you have a DNS query right in this

814
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,029
scenario what happens if the eam TEM 80

815
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:56,680
is created because of a DNS entry yes

816
00:42:55,029 --> 00:43:03,849
subsequently somewhere in a page there

817
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:06,190
is a string literal okay if I remember I

818
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,710
salt on that I remember I assault on

819
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,609
that this was part of why the original

820
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,609
net PT was

821
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:14,920
deprecated okay in 49 66 there's a bunch

822
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:16,538
of reasons why this stuff was annual

823
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,430
replaced with the nat64 and dns64

824
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:21,309
separating them out later you're sort of

825
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:24,220
reinventing Matt PT not pity on

826
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:26,079
thoughtfully relied on observing all of

827
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,299
the DNS going by to do all the mapping

828
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,329
and that was separated out into nat64

829
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:34,059
dns64 in part because I think I think

830
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:38,529
it's 49 66 the deprecated Matt PT you're

831
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:42,099
kind of reinventing it I need to sync on

832
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:45,190
that I believe III was considering that

833
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:48,099
case and and it goes not against this

834
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:52,900
this mechanism but I need to sing on

835
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:56,920
that again every drag I won't comment

836
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,989
too much on on the feature itself I got

837
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,999
some reservation to be honest but the

838
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:03,430
name should be changing it because if

839
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:04,808
ever it works it's wider than curious

840
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,299
yeah yeah yeah that's true

841
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,609
we started as I mentioned before we

842
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:11,079
started this as only sinking in for six

843
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:14,589
for exact and then we realize it that

844
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:19,180
it's useful for in fact any four six

845
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:19,749
translation right I haven't thought this

846
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,308
through

847
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:24,959
but you said that it doesn't break other

848
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:28,239
stuff doesn't this also break DNS SEC I

849
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,819
guess not DNS x4 does as well but this

850
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:38,619
feels an extra okay if if you are using

851
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:40,920
not 64 which dns64 DNS SEC may be broken

852
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:40,920
already

853
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,450
no no we are not using it but if you

854
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,589
remove the optimization what is will be

855
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:59,399
the wrestled DNS SEC broken as well you

856
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:59,400
see the point yeah

857
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,210
all right while we wait for him to

858
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:17,520
rejoin the queue uh chaired much Akamai

859
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:20,920
CDN or at least wearing a CDN hat I mean

860
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,190
we find our customers pay us to work in

861
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,020
all the situations and I'm concerned

862
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,300
about this because this is likely to

863
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,460
break the customer experience they don't

864
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,930
want to have their end customers end up

865
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,670
at a page that says I'm sorry this

866
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:37,330
content is only available if you're on a

867
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:39,220
v6 network so this seems infeasible this

868
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:43,390
seems interesting to discuss but

869
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:46,209
infeasible in practice okay we had

870
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:50,440
conversations with several CDN providers

871
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:53,620
including Akamai and they told us we

872
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:58,000
don't want to use a special addresses

873
00:45:53,620 --> 00:46:00,400
for ap v6 in the interfaces so you find

874
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,350
a better solution that having manual

875
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,900
configuration of a special addresses

876
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:10,660
it's better for us that's what we got

877
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:13,840
from you guys that would help ya address

878
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:16,810
at least one slice of the the concerns

879
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,180
but I think generally speaking our

880
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:22,029
customers pay us for the performance and

881
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:24,730
for a functioning service and in a way

882
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,490
in ways that this would show up in

883
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,830
operations I'm extremely concerned that

884
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,350
this would end up causing the customers

885
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:35,110
the end-user experience to be extremely

886
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:37,509
poor and they would be better off going

887
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:41,260
through an ad or something else as a

888
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:43,000
result then then trying to go and

889
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,610
communicate to us especially when our

890
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,890
customers are are doing in some cases

891
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:50,050
multi CDN approach so we have to

892
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,629
actually coordinate with them and with

893
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:54,460
everybody else in order to achieve this

894
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,230
and and you're seeing some of this play

895
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,810
out in the DNS working groups as well

896
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,830
with how to do things like a name etc

897
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:04,660
etc with how to have those how the

898
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:06,580
domain name holder can actually have

899
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:09,700
stuff show up in multiple different

900
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,990
realms we also have other additional

901
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,549
issues that will come up from DNS

902
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,609
tunneling which I won't get into here

903
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:17,080
and so yeah there's a lot of there's a

904
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:19,840
lot of reasons why this

905
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:33,310
is cool but it's also more reasons why

906
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:36,550
it's not gonna work hello yeah okay

907
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:40,660
hello hey how are you doing Shirley

908
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:45,250
thanks for the presentation well this is

909
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:50,799
a very interesting work we have working

910
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:54,670
with Shirley I just wanted to comment

911
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:58,630
some things what

912
00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:05,950
Shirley's Senate of course this draft is

913
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:08,320
all poured before as you know in the

914
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:16,120
process we we were working on that we

915
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:21,730
restore that make tissue mekinese like

916
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:31,900
mod p and order to achieve neutral

917
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:39,940
services within the the ISP out of the

918
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:43,870
service provider right so but assurances

919
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:49,990
I work in network greater in Argentina

920
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:53,140
and I really really like X lot but when

921
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:56,200
I was implementing that because I able

922
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,299
to get a few more in a term I'm going to

923
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:03,009
support

924
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:05,340
silat I discovered that I won't be able

925
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:13,720
to implement this transition economies

926
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:16,810
because many many network service

927
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:22,890
provider have an already or medical

928
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:28,930
intimidation were with a pole to use the

929
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:29,770
cgn by doing a bypass and true in let

930
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:33,129
this

931
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:37,720
Cillian to deliver directly the traffic

932
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:40,950
to the to the cable modems without going

933
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:45,600
through dissonant so if we implement

934
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:51,879
also for its lack of before Eric speak

935
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:56,200
we we will need to to deliver again the

936
00:49:51,880 --> 00:50:01,810
traffic through the this through the

937
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:06,310
nat64 202 anything that's it for to the

938
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:09,820
final TVs or set-top boxes which most of

939
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:12,360
them are just in a be reformed that's

940
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,790
why I won't be able to recommend to our

941
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:21,670
company to solution for C Ferguson at

942
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:26,730
the willing to implement a large-scale

943
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:31,180
object for that was the main issue and

944
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:34,840
another point of your listed that we

945
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:38,310
were talking with many content providers

946
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,290
of Syrians for example of Facebook

947
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:45,279
impermanence the trap that they were

948
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:50,850
interested in in any transmission

949
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:55,080
mechanism that in evolving definitely a

950
00:50:50,850 --> 00:51:01,690
second nuts if fuller or as ETA me

951
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:05,200
because get the most transparent we need

952
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:09,250
to be finding customer so the most of

953
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:14,609
customers already has our PP in router

954
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:20,020
mall right if we we will add in another

955
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:22,920
they're not device in the middle they

956
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:27,040
they don't we don't like it for example

957
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:29,260
Google Plus efficient is support for the

958
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:34,420
traffic directly without knowing

959
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:37,170
precision we didn't have any saturation

960
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:42,950
and any any congestion but we

961
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:45,710
implemented that with the final draft

962
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:51,308
internment a little bit but was amended

963
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:55,099
and with any intercession and part of

964
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:59,210
auspicious incision but it showed to us

965
00:51:55,099 --> 00:52:01,280
that obviously with a mod direct

966
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,359
connection without going through

967
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,880
decision

968
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:11,779
we finally get a bad performance which

969
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:16,579
confirmed that this could be a right way

970
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:26,230
to optimize the network so that's what I

971
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:29,720
wanted to share ok thank you Andrew yeah

972
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:35,000
Judy I was watching that last section of

973
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:38,359
your presentation and maybe I'm missing

974
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,980
something here but if you add a fake a

975
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:47,089
record to make this work that works ok

976
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:50,510
if somebody is behind this however if

977
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:52,910
you've got a v4 only client outside

978
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:55,400
normally when he's browsing and there's

979
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,319
not a record it goes well there's no a

980
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,480
record go away and it does that pretty

981
00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:03,410
quickly if you've got a fake a record

982
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:06,109
there it's suddenly going to cause some

983
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:10,308
significant degradation as it tries to

984
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:12,049
access that and if it was a real v4

985
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:13,849
address then you were using a real

986
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,910
forward baseball then it's your step

987
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:20,750
anyway so the option using a fake area

988
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:23,180
code on something doesn't fly because it

989
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:27,710
will break people who aren't behind us

990
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:31,790
and who I probably miss it explaining it

991
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:34,099
this was not the original idea of all

992
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:36,020
this this is an extra and we don't know

993
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:39,349
and I think I have in the drivers

994
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:42,049
question Mars we didn't want that we

995
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:44,390
didn't salt on this originally that we

996
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:49,160
thought ok if some people start

997
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:51,799
deploying ipv6 only services if they are

998
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,879
not reachable by ipv4 only devices right

999
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:58,029
they will break now

1000
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,849
you have such kind of services in the

1001
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:03,220
future and you do this you at least

1002
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:05,920
solve the problem for set-top boxes and

1003
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:08,680
a Smart TVs that ipv4 only for the

1004
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,640
others will not work but because it was

1005
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:19,058
an ipv6 only service not intended to be

1006
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:22,480
accessible by ipv4 only devices okay yes

1007
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:24,309
it won't work right but there is there

1008
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,480
is a rule that if something's gonna fail

1009
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:29,230
and it's not going to work

1010
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:33,490
it must fail fast if it's a fake v4

1011
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:35,890
address the delay in that failure is

1012
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:38,879
going to be far more extended then I do

1013
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:42,490
not have an area code go away

1014
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:46,000
unless you have a webpage if it's a

1015
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:49,019
webpage service that says this is not

1016
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,289
reachable because you are not on ipv6

1017
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:55,089
again this is an extra this probably

1018
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:58,660
probably this need to be in a different

1019
00:54:55,089 --> 00:55:00,250
ID so don't consider this as the main

1020
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,259
thing of this presentation because

1021
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:09,069
probably we are going to split the

1022
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:10,900
document in two different documents over

1023
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:14,589
eyes a media of Verizon named - sure

1024
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,910
today so if you go back you essentially

1025
00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:20,049
are saying that you're going to watch

1026
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:22,058
for DNS lookups then you're gonna look

1027
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:24,130
at the before I answered your query

1028
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:27,579
against the what are fine they call it

1029
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,180
v6 and then create a mapping so here's

1030
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:30,579
the question

1031
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:34,269
majority of CDM is out there you see

1032
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:36,339
Ning chains in order to do this so look

1033
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:38,049
up against example.com which will see

1034
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:40,720
name potential to a different place for

1035
00:55:38,049 --> 00:55:42,450
before vs. v6 now you have another

1036
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,149
lookup which one are you gonna try to

1037
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:48,250
fake on us because we do this for

1038
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:51,549
performance reasons and odds are the two

1039
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:52,900
mappings are not the same so how in the

1040
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:54,940
world they actually going to do this in

1041
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,359
a way that doesn't matter we'll break

1042
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:02,049
the forms okay let's look from there

1043
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:06,848
from the CP device from the CP if I do

1044
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:08,660
an a query to reach Yahoo I will get to

1045
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:11,420
up to place right

1046
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:13,910
if instead of equity if instead of an

1047
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,609
equity I do a quite a query I will go to

1048
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:21,980
another place right now what I am saying

1049
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:26,359
is I am Telling You Yahoo that I am NOT

1050
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:28,069
an ipv4 device I am an ipv6 device that

1051
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:29,750
will that should work because you don't

1052
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:34,150
know in advance which kind of device you

1053
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:36,710
have in the CP right or behind the CP so

1054
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:39,950
it's no way to know exactly what you

1055
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:43,430
know but exactly is that in the process

1056
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:45,529
of doing that let's say male des

1057
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:48,230
yahoo.com you try to go there and you

1058
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:50,930
decided to take my answer for Melda

1059
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:53,000
yahoo.com that's New York now try to

1060
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,078
look it up from a different place

1061
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,700
because now you're gonna do it from a

1062
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,490
different place and that different place

1063
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,689
is gonna tell you some Francisco so now

1064
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:02,450
you're going to just assume that New

1065
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:08,089
York equals San Francisco in before v6

1066
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:11,240
potentially and well is the same because

1067
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:14,180
if if I am a real ipv6 device I will get

1068
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:17,328
the same response and I am going to use

1069
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,129
the TTL for the DNS responses you may or

1070
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:20,770
may not get the same response because

1071
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,970
the poles for the server's are not

1072
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,500
necessarily the same and they're not

1073
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,118
going to same lip and they're not up at

1074
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,579
the same time you're right

1075
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:31,160
may maybe or maybe not but this is the

1076
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:35,980
same result as if I am a real ipv6

1077
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:39,259
device device the content provider is

1078
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:41,930
going to be responsible for how long the

1079
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:44,569
maintenance last at what point our

1080
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:47,029
timeouts kick in there is a two

1081
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:48,740
different sets of TTLs for v4 versus V

1082
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:53,270
such records very often so it's not just

1083
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:55,490
that the DNS details there's what okay

1084
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:57,500
audience and there you are what we have

1085
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:01,700
asked it several times in the list is

1086
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:04,670
please people from CBN's tell us if this

1087
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:06,919
may work or not and what we can do to

1088
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:08,839
improve it so please go to the list I

1089
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,299
mean one of the big things is that you

1090
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:15,020
know our v4 services are there for a

1091
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:19,309
reason and we probably would not want

1092
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:21,319
your fake v6 connectivity because so one

1093
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:22,360
of the big things is that some apps do

1094
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:25,490
not support the

1095
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,860
don't support v6 not because you can't

1096
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:29,479
connect the movies huh but because for

1097
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:33,260
logging requirements or whatever other

1098
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,570
security tokens whatever they're not v6

1099
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,490
enabled from a abuse perspective or

1100
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:38,960
something else all of a sudden you're

1101
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:41,930
trying to connect and spoof them out

1102
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,420
from a v4 client that can't actually

1103
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:48,049
provide sufficient information over v6

1104
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:50,330
will break things which will result in

1105
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:53,930
most of us black less than you which

1106
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:56,420
will break things of a more well what we

1107
00:58:53,930 --> 00:59:00,020
are trying precisely to avoid that so

1108
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:02,060
the way we are doing we believe is not

1109
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,070
going to create anything but for you

1110
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:07,790
that's what we need to double check with

1111
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:10,070
your help guys you're making the

1112
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:12,050
decision in the middle without any

1113
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:14,810
information what either side needs and

1114
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:15,800
you're making a lot of assumptions in

1115
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:18,080
your game there's something that you

1116
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,230
could do this in DNS which as we saw

1117
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,819
with not PT failed utterly because

1118
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:26,090
there's a lot of protocols out there

1119
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:27,620
they use before literals and there's a

1120
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,290
bunch of other stuff out there which is

1121
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:38,870
why was deprecated to begin with there's

1122
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:41,360
games like a giant step back so thanks

1123
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:44,359
to your Oren did you have something you

1124
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,790
are saying um quick question so you have

1125
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,380
the CP doing the DNS lookup something I

1126
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:51,560
couldn't figure out from the draft is is

1127
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:53,810
the CPE supposed to spy on all DNS

1128
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,460
traffic or only queries which are

1129
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,020
actually sent to it is it supposed to do

1130
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,940
only the queries that are sent to it

1131
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,160
because like in some countries it's like

1132
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:04,280
70 or 80 percent of people just don't

1133
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,049
use their CPE provided DNS exactly and

1134
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,050
that's already mentioned in the document

1135
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:11,900
if you don't use the CP for the queries

1136
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,120
you will not get optimized it but we

1137
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:24,410
don't break anything

1138
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:26,480
so that's already in the draft please go

1139
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:28,310
to the list especially or I am here all

1140
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,340
the week especially the people working

1141
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:33,380
in Syrians I think we can probably fix

1142
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,440
if there is anything broken here thank

1143
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,440
you

1144
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:07,100
hello son I kind of have a problem yeah

1145
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:09,230
big one when users try to connect to v6

1146
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,060
on the networks they sometimes coming

1147
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:15,170
back to be complaining and said oh it

1148
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:18,140
takes ages for my device to confirm that

1149
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:21,910
there is network connectivity so after

1150
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:24,589
looking into it what we found out is

1151
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,629
hello gern Hall joins the network or

1152
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:29,630
actually it's almost the same with host

1153
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:33,850
configures in you bla bla dress so host

1154
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:36,860
and saneras maybe if there is a

1155
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:39,110
corresponding option in Torres router

1156
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:42,640
might create a neighbor cache for host

1157
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:45,920
link-local doesn't might actually then

1158
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,290
host get back and erase which I forgot

1159
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,810
to put on this picture and then it

1160
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:53,840
configures global address default

1161
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:57,380
gateway and it has a neighbor cache

1162
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,240
entry for Lille for default gateway link

1163
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,130
Alcala dress and the corresponding MAC

1164
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:05,270
address so host is basically ready to

1165
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:07,250
send traffic all good now hosts are

1166
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:09,560
sending traffic and actually address may

1167
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:12,650
be still optimistic if a host is using

1168
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:16,330
optimistic that hosts engine can address

1169
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:20,510
our packets somewhere off link router

1170
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:23,060
successfully routing same link and all

1171
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:26,960
loops good no neighbor cache updates at

1172
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:29,029
this stage right then return traffic

1173
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,310
comes the first packets appears on the

1174
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:34,130
route or from outside run altercations

1175
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:37,520
the packet look oh I have no neighbor

1176
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:39,950
Cassandra for that address and creates

1177
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,440
incomplete entry and starts all his

1178
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:45,710
neighbor discovery process meantime what

1179
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:49,329
packets arrive all the speckles get

1180
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:53,009
dropped unfortunately then it's

1181
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:57,219
point of time MA coming back from a host

1182
01:02:53,009 --> 01:02:59,859
whose router neighbor country changed

1183
01:02:57,219 --> 01:03:02,109
stay to reachable that first but red

1184
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:05,769
packet may be delivered the host and ma

1185
01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:07,749
traffic a potential occurs apparently

1186
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:09,669
and some applications might be unhappy

1187
01:03:07,749 --> 01:03:12,098
about also spec it's being dropped

1188
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:14,979
because if for example they implement

1189
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:17,109
increment like exponential back-off it

1190
01:03:14,979 --> 01:03:18,489
might introduce huge delay and in

1191
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:21,190
general when I look at this it basically

1192
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:22,900
means we designed neighbor discovery in

1193
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:24,969
a way that it intentionally drops

1194
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,690
packets all the times there is no way to

1195
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:29,849
avoid it

1196
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:29,849
it's like by design which is kind of sad

1197
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:36,029
Manu seriously so what I'd like to see

1198
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:39,669
an ideal or like spherical a spherical

1199
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:44,229
Network in vacuum old boot right so

1200
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:47,170
ideally as soon as start sending packets

1201
01:03:44,229 --> 01:03:50,069
from a host outside it would be nice to

1202
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:52,450
somehow create a neighbor cache entry

1203
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:57,699
right so when a returning traffic

1204
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:59,739
arrives it's already and actually in if

1205
01:03:57,699 --> 01:04:02,559
it was just two hosts on the same link

1206
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:04,839
it happens because neighbor discovery

1207
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,180
takes care of it if you sent an MS to

1208
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:09,699
talk to host host will create a neighbor

1209
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:11,348
currently because it assumes it you want

1210
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:15,039
to talk to me I might need to send some

1211
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:17,019
traffic back to you soon so actually on

1212
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:20,499
dual stack networks we do not notice

1213
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:22,808
this because when ipv4 addresses

1214
01:04:20,499 --> 01:04:26,680
configured host actually announced that

1215
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:28,989
and all neighbors including routers get

1216
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,430
their caches updated and as a result

1217
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:33,299
because we have high payables

1218
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:37,598
dual stack networks working very well so

1219
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:39,519
on as I said the problem is that this

1220
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,109
would have worked for only in

1221
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:44,890
communication but it does not work

1222
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:47,440
because routers are not not supposed to

1223
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:50,410
create a neighbor country if they

1224
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,410
receive an A so if we try to do this ARP

1225
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:54,479
like sync for neighbor discovery it

1226
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:57,910
would not work because

1227
01:04:54,479 --> 01:05:00,129
1461 explicitly prohibited with a good

1228
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:02,839
reasoning which works for only in

1229
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:04,730
communication but for adversity

1230
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:07,340
completely different use case if you see

1231
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:10,330
a router might need to send traffic back

1232
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:13,580
without without receiving NS previously

1233
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:15,590
so it looks like the reason is good but

1234
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:20,180
not for out there surrounded by kind of

1235
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:21,920
X exclude that from that logic so as I

1236
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:25,580
said what we act sure when a web server

1237
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,890
and packet loss all the time delay for

1238
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:30,080
applications to start using the network

1239
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:32,629
and as a result I'm creepy eyeballs

1240
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,279
because users are complaining you don't

1241
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:39,110
know before in every and now everything

1242
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:41,810
is worse than before so options what we

1243
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,980
can do we can say a nasan we can look

1244
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:45,950
and take can be tweaked neighbor

1245
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:49,640
discovery all we can try to look into

1246
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:52,370
advertising addresses from hosts we can

1247
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,310
just fix hosts and applications yeah

1248
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:57,859
there are option of buffer ma packets on

1249
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:59,509
the routers but obviously it's not an

1250
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:01,550
option because we basically make router

1251
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:04,460
suspect able to neighbor discover a

1252
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:06,890
cache attack once you want to comment or

1253
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,150
you just want me to finish no I think

1254
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:09,529
there's something else we can do which

1255
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:16,400
is also a bad idea but I'll say that

1256
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:18,980
later ok so before talking about

1257
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,140
solution I was trying to summarize how

1258
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:23,270
the solution should look like so

1259
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:27,020
obviously it would be really nice to

1260
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:29,120
create a stale entry in our neighbor

1261
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,910
cache for a host if not if simply

1262
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,650
doesn't exist obviously we do not want

1263
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,690
to overwrite the existing entry to

1264
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:38,810
minimize the disruption because as I

1265
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:41,270
said address my D optimistic so we do

1266
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:43,759
not know if there are any real owner of

1267
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:46,070
that address and link about it again it

1268
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,630
would be nice if applications could use

1269
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:50,330
it for optimistic addresses as well

1270
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:52,040
because it's exactly the case when you

1271
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:55,130
want to start using the network as soon

1272
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,840
as possible so if device so application

1273
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,910
is okay with delays it probably would

1274
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,460
not be using optimistic addresses and

1275
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:04,399
they might be okay with like 10 second

1276
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:06,830
delay before they could connect and also

1277
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,570
as you might know in some networks you

1278
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:10,549
have more than one router so it would be

1279
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:12,680
nice if traffic live in the network from

1280
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,790
one router and return flow goes through

1281
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,250
another it still works

1282
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:19,310
so again nice and work

1283
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:21,080
intended you I don't know maybe we can

1284
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:22,790
say okay it's a cosmetic issue we can

1285
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,380
wait for 10 seconds every time your

1286
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:27,259
hosts connect to the network with a new

1287
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:29,780
address but as I said obviously it makes

1288
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:33,290
people unhappy and I think it hurts the

1289
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:35,780
deployments so users get a feeling that

1290
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:37,850
v6 only networks do not work as well as

1291
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:41,090
was there coupons so it's introduced

1292
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:43,100
additional resistance so that's cool

1293
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,170
with the great suggestions about can we

1294
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,480
look into registration based in G which

1295
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:50,660
is used in other types of the network

1296
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:54,170
well it's a kind of maybe it's a

1297
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:55,910
strategic solution I don't know if so by

1298
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:58,430
solving this problem you introduce as a

1299
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:01,190
problem so not so I think it should be

1300
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:03,470
discussed maybe actually in six manner

1301
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,910
not here so I'm not covering this in

1302
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:06,980
this slide because I think it should be

1303
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:10,330
completely different topic what we can

1304
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:13,550
do tactically again coming back to an a

1305
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:15,860
logic it looks like it does make sense

1306
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:17,990
for host to do the same thing as we did

1307
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:21,830
in before and advertise in your address

1308
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:23,630
and for our alters routers should

1309
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,790
acknowledge this should because should

1310
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:27,290
means you don't do this unless you have

1311
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:29,450
a very good reason and I believe

1312
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:32,210
providing cool when I read this

1313
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:36,049
justification router it doesn't apply to

1314
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,609
routers and actually some vendors

1315
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:38,149
well-known vendor sexually have this

1316
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:40,940
already

1317
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:45,229
it's a configurable feature when they

1318
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:48,349
could glean from any packets sent by

1319
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:50,269
devices yes I said the good thing is

1320
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,819
it's actually RFC compliant we just need

1321
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:54,080
to ignore should and already implement

1322
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:57,259
that so there is actually deployment

1323
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,720
experience with this and it works for a

1324
01:08:57,259 --> 01:09:01,399
symmetric traffic flow so we have first

1325
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,650
hop redundancy over others you'll

1326
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:06,318
receive an a over outers will obtain a

1327
01:09:03,649 --> 01:09:09,259
broker obviously it would require some

1328
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:12,170
changes to hosts of course wants to

1329
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:15,020
start using network as quick as possible

1330
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:17,390
and obviously this feature needs to be

1331
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:20,720
configurable because probably nobody

1332
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:23,150
wants this by default to prevent attacks

1333
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,069
on neighbor cache absorption and again

1334
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:28,040
every time you do something within G as

1335
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:29,060
I discovered you have a slight chance of

1336
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,189
being affected by

1337
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:33,290
smart intermedia intermediate Wi-Fi

1338
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:36,139
devices which can do some neighbor

1339
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:39,470
discovery tricks but it's I don't think

1340
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:42,650
we can do much here and other options

1341
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:44,720
are I looked at was host my scent

1342
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:48,670
neighbor solicitation from its global

1343
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:54,710
address to a router it would create

1344
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:56,630
stale entry for that host for that

1345
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:58,400
address on the router because again it

1346
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:00,590
will be like standard neighbor discovery

1347
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,089
state machine if you get an anise 4 Mew

1348
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:04,130
I probably need to create an entry

1349
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:05,900
however the main problem here it

1350
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:07,670
wouldn't work for optimistic addresses

1351
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,769
because exactly for this reason to

1352
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:12,350
prevent disruption in case of duplicate

1353
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:17,540
addresses hosts are not allowed to say

1354
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:21,380
and NS with source link layer address

1355
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:23,540
option so this would not work another

1356
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:26,210
option is sent address from global

1357
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:30,860
address to a router then I think it

1358
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:33,860
would again it would work if address is

1359
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:35,389
not optimistic or it would work actually

1360
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,070
40 mystic addresses if route the

1361
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,720
response for unicast because what's

1362
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:43,309
happened over address would receive

1363
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:45,260
errors if address is not optimistic MAC

1364
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:48,550
address was included into options and

1365
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:50,990
routers will create an entry if

1366
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:53,780
addresses empty mystic answer is no my

1367
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:56,660
country SSL la option in arrays then if

1368
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:57,889
router responds with array unicast it

1369
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,019
will need to do all this neighbor

1370
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:03,170
discovery machine but again it might

1371
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,570
introduce additional delay because erase

1372
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:09,710
will be sent with some random delay they

1373
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:11,150
might be Scotland so what also suggested

1374
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:15,920
that we might just start pink in the

1375
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:18,589
router ok someday the traffic go into

1376
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:22,460
the router address 3 through the SSH a

1377
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:24,170
DGP session whatever yeah as Goods

1378
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:27,110
increase it will probably bypass all

1379
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:32,270
this intellectual middleboxes

1380
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:36,400
and wireless the cons is I'm not sure

1381
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:39,500
you can always send such a packet to

1382
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,320
another address its additional CPU load

1383
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,890
on routers will be dropped by a control

1384
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,990
plane

1385
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:47,020
action and again what else you've left

1386
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:51,559
the empty router would not work in

1387
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:54,440
isometric traffic flow so what I'm

1388
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,550
trying to summarize is suggestion is

1389
01:11:54,440 --> 01:12:01,759
kind of recommend router vendors to do

1390
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:03,980
configurable glean from unsolicited

1391
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,390
honest again configurable it shouldn't

1392
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:09,379
be on by default it shouldn't be enable

1393
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:11,360
per interface and and host probably can

1394
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:14,650
send unsolicited Tenace when they get a

1395
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,790
new address configure security

1396
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:19,610
considerations warren was concerned

1397
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:23,860
about breaking stuff actually no because

1398
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:28,160
the only changes proposed is to create

1399
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:32,089
entry when entry does not exist so if

1400
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:34,519
you're concerned about host doing and

1401
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:36,380
the exhaustion of it could do it anyway

1402
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,420
right it could sent an SS it could send

1403
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:40,370
RSS whatever whatever if you have

1404
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:46,640
malicious hosts inside nice and changes

1405
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:49,000
right for from service this from a

1406
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:51,890
disruption perspective again we only

1407
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,440
talking about situation when there is no

1408
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:56,210
entry even incomplete entry wouldn't be

1409
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,759
updated only talking about situation

1410
01:12:56,210 --> 01:13:01,790
when entry does not exist so it's safe

1411
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,320
to assume that there is no traffic for

1412
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:04,970
that host yes there is a very rare

1413
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,700
condition when host might be sleeping

1414
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:10,100
for 25 days someone sent a packet from

1415
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:12,530
outside and in the same moment of time

1416
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:16,100
we got a duplicate address coming on our

1417
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:20,990
well I'm not sure if it's so critical

1418
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:23,450
that it better to still see in constant

1419
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:28,880
packet loss in all other cases I says

1420
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:32,000
it's all I have go back to the

1421
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,050
gratuitous ARP one and while you're

1422
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,340
doing that I point out that's not

1423
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:38,060
actually gratuitous off that's

1424
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:43,790
optimistic or cleaning our I can't read

1425
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:52,370
pasta to really stick to me we won't

1426
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:54,470
slide Turin our port and the reason why

1427
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:56,300
doesn't work maybe six is the TRA has

1428
01:13:54,470 --> 01:14:00,320
the SLO leo all

1429
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:02,330
that's not what I was gonna say all I

1430
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,940
gotta say is this was a problem and

1431
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:07,220
before we solved it in v4 by doing the

1432
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:09,740
opportunistic or cleaning or carpenter

1433
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:12,080
ease and that works well enough that

1434
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:14,750
like on the ITF hotel network the router

1435
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:17,150
doesn't send any Arps at all so like

1436
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:19,550
it's a problem in v4 we fixed it in v4

1437
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:31,490
it's a problem in v6 we should fix it in

1438
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:32,870
v6 question so the that the have you

1439
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:35,690
seen what other implementations do I

1440
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:39,590
think Windows Windows sends or used to

1441
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:41,389
send na to ffo to Kona column one have

1442
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:44,510
you seen what other implementations do I

1443
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:46,730
know that Android doesn't ID okay I have

1444
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:48,980
the best implementations yet I think Mac

1445
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:50,540
OS does not do that it was a report on

1446
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:54,589
release from Alexandros with Windows

1447
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:56,690
does this and obviously I think so so

1448
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:58,460
obviously some vendors implemented that

1449
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:00,620
on the router equipment so I suspect

1450
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,650
they had a reason for this so there are

1451
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:06,830
some environments when hos doing this

1452
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:09,769
alright so and again it's kind of if you

1453
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:11,990
want Android device to do this like to

1454
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:14,660
get the cash update at first they

1455
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:17,660
probably make sense to do something so

1456
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:19,400
as I said I have some concerns about

1457
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:21,410
syncing trace through the pings because

1458
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,059
it might not work on every environment

1459
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:28,090
and I believe this might better chances

1460
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:31,790
to work if router vendors doing blame

1461
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:35,120
have you checked that the unsolicited in

1462
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:41,090
a survives like optimizing Wi-Fi devices

1463
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:42,920
I feel like I sent one eye on the device

1464
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:45,110
I guess that and I think it did yeah

1465
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,840
well it doesn't mean it's gonna survive

1466
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:50,269
every optimized Wi-Fi but I assume if

1467
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:53,060
what Warren is sworn is saying right it

1468
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:54,770
does for you for so yeah we have a good

1469
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:56,660
chance if it doesn't it might be just

1470
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:58,970
this code is not in place here's some

1471
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:04,550
wireless devices but again it's not

1472
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:07,760
fundamental issue shared much Akamai it

1473
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:09,310
seems like yeah we should update it to

1474
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,940
be explicit

1475
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:14,830
to say that the routers III think it

1476
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:17,799
should probably be promoted from the

1477
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:22,200
should text that I saw highlighted to

1478
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:25,030
you know something something else and is

1479
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,740
yeah yeah yeah sorry I think you I think

1480
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:29,440
you might have showed both I think you

1481
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:33,670
might show the change so basically it's

1482
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:36,400
a it's very hot sent right it's talking

1483
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:39,040
to us so I think what we should be doing

1484
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:42,400
I suggest we write a document for router

1485
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:44,530
when you're saying router recover as

1486
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,920
they recommended to ignore this shoot

1487
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:48,820
and have a configuration option

1488
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:54,520
configuration option to ignore this

1489
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:56,740
shoot and still do beam yes so it's this

1490
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,960
one right because River dweller

1491
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:01,090
violations is how I've seen it's it's

1492
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,280
talking about host sexually so it's not

1493
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:05,260
a case for routers right yeah I think we

1494
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,139
should give it explicit guidance you get

1495
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:11,170
the router yeah router vendors implement

1496
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:13,090
implementers and then do a bit of an

1497
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:15,580
inventor us would do an inventory of

1498
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:18,130
what what vendor is to stuff because it

1499
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:20,500
looks like iOS does this mmm-hmm but it

1500
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:25,090
doesn't look like the others have

1501
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:27,760
configuration knobs for them yeah high

1502
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:31,360
equal missions gave one of the others of

1503
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:36,660
65 83 with Warren so the vendor that is

1504
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:39,610
doing so yes this is a massive problem

1505
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:45,580
the vendor that is doing cleaning based

1506
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:47,170
off dad has done so based on our I don't

1507
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:50,650
know if the feature request would be the

1508
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:53,050
right way of mandate like we have tried

1509
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:54,339
to actually when we were writing 65 83

1510
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:56,260
this was one of the things we want to

1511
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,610
put in the equivalent of gratuitous ARP

1512
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:01,690
the way that we were suggesting to do

1513
01:17:57,610 --> 01:18:03,309
that was basically when dad is being

1514
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:06,700
done at that point

1515
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:08,740
sorry not gratuitous cleaning your fault

1516
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:10,840
cuz you would just mention it but

1517
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:14,620
basically do glean based on receiving a

1518
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:17,290
dad at that point put it on stale

1519
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:20,230
revalidate and kick off the process we

1520
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:21,399
were told that a document of the six ops

1521
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:24,579
should not mention

1522
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:27,999
a implementation of a protocol which is

1523
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:31,869
why was not included in 65 83 yes that

1524
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:33,369
is exactly what we're told we could

1525
01:18:31,869 --> 01:18:39,188
probably find some of the original text

1526
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:46,959
if you want to do that yes we were not

1527
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:50,499
allowed to make which is why our yeah so

1528
01:18:46,959 --> 01:18:52,570
we actually had to go to six man there

1529
01:18:50,499 --> 01:19:03,489
were other not change there are other

1530
01:18:52,570 --> 01:19:05,139
changes too so basically we had other

1531
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:07,509
things that we went to six men and

1532
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:09,280
modified the nut behavior but this

1533
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:12,249
particular one that we try to modify we

1534
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,949
were told was in our place please finish

1535
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:19,599
our work and I could probably find some

1536
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:23,228
of the ridges here I probably have at

1537
01:19:19,599 --> 01:19:25,329
some work as I most of the original the

1538
01:19:23,229 --> 01:19:27,249
original work I wrote the original thing

1539
01:19:25,329 --> 01:19:30,099
that Warren had to rewrite completely

1540
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:33,070
for 65 83 but my original one probably

1541
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:35,530
has the gleam text and a tall shitty to

1542
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:37,030
you but the reason why a version of

1543
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:39,610
Cisco implements it is because they were

1544
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,889
our vendor at the time and we work with

1545
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:43,419
them to make it happen because otherwise

1546
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:49,149
my iPhone could take out a data center

1547
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:50,769
and there's not a happy place to be okay

1548
01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:53,919
so we we discussed implementation

1549
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:55,899
details cool and the problem is that we

1550
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:57,340
were not allowed as v6 ops were not

1551
01:19:55,899 --> 01:20:00,610
allowed to discuss these implementation

1552
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,739
details and in here it was supposed to

1553
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:04,239
be six men and six men didn't care about

1554
01:20:02,739 --> 01:20:05,909
the implementation of how it's actually

1555
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:08,678
done and routers they cared about spec

1556
01:20:05,909 --> 01:20:13,929
we should wash a place that it would be

1557
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:17,019
awesome if we thought well we are not

1558
01:20:13,929 --> 01:20:19,739
allowed to do this protocol we are

1559
01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:24,209
allowed to according to our curve

1560
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:24,209
provide operational work grounds

1561
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:31,040
and we are allowed to provided advice to

1562
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:35,750
other working groups in specifically

1563
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:37,790
six-man seems like where you're going is

1564
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:42,800
we need an erratum against

1565
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:43,460
4860 ones that says no actually so this

1566
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:49,670
seshu

1567
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:52,760
right so you want to change that shirt

1568
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:54,650
in the event that it's relevant no I

1569
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,710
don't think we need to change it we need

1570
01:20:54,650 --> 01:21:01,339
to say guidelines for outer implement

1571
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:02,750
resides they could may those a glint

1572
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:12,350
because I see you shoot

1573
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:18,500
we've been while I shoot isn't should

1574
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:20,270
not basically waste me wait we need to

1575
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:22,370
file an erratum against forty eight

1576
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:24,530
sixty one that covers the case to your

1577
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:25,910
very not necessarily and the other thing

1578
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:32,710
that we need to do is provide

1579
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:35,900
operational guidance right yeah I mean

1580
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:37,850
so you can file it or rod up but there's

1581
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,620
no I can accept it because that would be

1582
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:41,630
changing what the intent was when they

1583
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:44,120
wrote it so whether or not I agree it's

1584
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:46,910
a stupid thing when it was written an

1585
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:49,970
errata I can't be used to change an

1586
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:52,550
existing not even any clarify or really

1587
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:54,440
the only way yeah you know what we could

1588
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:57,410
probably do is if it were to be written

1589
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:59,059
in v6 ops and we walked over to six

1590
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:00,620
matter like we're just is it okay with

1591
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:03,830
you all if we just mess with this bit

1592
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:04,940
they might say it's more trouble to for

1593
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:07,700
us to do it than for you to do it

1594
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:11,419
whatever but I think it's useful a

1595
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:13,490
document is written and if we discuss it

1596
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:15,650
there and if we say we think this is a

1597
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:17,000
great idea and we take it to six man

1598
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:19,309
even if they want to actually progress

1599
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,690
it you know having a bunch of operator

1600
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:22,610
people show up and say yeah this is

1601
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,799
broken it would be better if we just

1602
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:26,509
make this one small patch you know cause

1603
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,880
it has to progress this year if it has

1604
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:35,990
progressed and I don't think we need to

1605
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:37,790
discuss politics debit number let's go

1606
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:39,230
from easy to hard

1607
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:41,269
if you have a smart Wi-Fi solution

1608
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:43,309
ideally you would update your smart

1609
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:47,090
Wi-Fi solution and it would do then a to

1610
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:49,400
the router for the Wi-Fi client which is

1611
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:53,360
that's totally what's gonna happen even

1612
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:57,009
if you don't want it yeah it will happen

1613
01:22:53,360 --> 01:23:01,009
if we proceed this way

1614
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:04,100
why oh I would so the the Wi-Fi

1615
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:08,810
controller will interfer it's it's it it

1616
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:09,620
is it is its job to interfere basically

1617
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:12,680
with all of the neighbor discovery

1618
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:17,059
traffic so it will totally sit it's boxy

1619
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:19,820
in the middle they're going to send

1620
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:22,250
unsolicited a and make sure router is

1621
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:25,099
updated fine we discussed about the

1622
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:27,890
trailers normally unless it's a one

1623
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:36,680
particular vendor ignore those anaise

1624
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:40,250
right yeah okay so either way the detail

1625
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:43,550
on the presentation the end I do see one

1626
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:49,070
privacy issue with this which is that if

1627
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:50,870
you do the n/a for privacy address you

1628
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:53,900
have to broadcast it essentially or

1629
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:57,019
multicast it so you didn't do that

1630
01:23:53,900 --> 01:24:19,120
before are you you sent an MS for that

1631
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:22,100
do you do that okay we have two more

1632
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,540
Erik line I'm not an ad but it seems

1633
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:26,110
like a document that's saying why this

1634
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:29,120
should is violative all four routers

1635
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:32,389
it's not necessarily out of scope that's

1636
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:37,610
all you need to say right okay just

1637
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:40,190
explanation my and headaches also in any

1638
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:42,469
of the testing that you did do you ever

1639
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:44,660
try setting the router alert option on

1640
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:45,770
any of the messages hmm does that change

1641
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:48,410
anything

1642
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:50,870
no I was kid retracting your office and

1643
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:52,280
just in case yeah we can yeah I don't

1644
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:54,530
know I don't know how routers actually

1645
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:58,730
hey with around earlier adoption maybe

1646
01:24:54,530 --> 01:25:02,349
maybe they all ignore it alright called

1647
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:06,589
Robin in your shoes if I not get paged

1648
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:09,110
for crashing also I mean testing with

1649
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:14,150
Android devices those those addresses

1650
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:15,589
are optimistic by default right try it

1651
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,070
was something it's not doing it's not

1652
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:18,070
good

1653
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:23,060
Tim winner of you and a try well couple

1654
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:24,560
things I think this is a good idea

1655
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:26,330
I do think we're gonna have to put

1656
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,270
something in here about up it being an

1657
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:30,500
update to 48 61 there's two way too many

1658
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:33,320
implementations out there that will just

1659
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:34,580
ignore these packets the only other

1660
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,740
thing is make sure it goes to the all

1661
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:38,840
routers not to the all nodes address

1662
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:43,790
because we only want routers to care

1663
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:45,440
about this and yeah I think I forgot to

1664
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:52,250
put it in the case but yeah I was

1665
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:53,719
thinking you can send yeah okay oh we

1666
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:55,790
have plenty of implementations we'd be

1667
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,310
more than happy to tell you guys what

1668
01:25:55,790 --> 01:26:04,870
current implementations do at i/o well

1669
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:04,870
so whatever you guys need

1670
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:10,130
speaking of all we're is restore old

1671
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:13,549
hosts I know that there are a bunch of

1672
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:16,160
devices that drop stuff to all that drop

1673
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:18,620
stuff to all nodes but not all rivers

1674
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:21,290
and if those things happen to have

1675
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:22,940
forwarding turned on then by sending it

1676
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:26,030
to all reuters you'll start chewing up

1677
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:28,700
their batteries we want to be careful

1678
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:31,120
about what current implementations do so

1679
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,120
I heard about that

1680
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:35,570
David lamp utter again but if you don't

1681
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:39,769
send it to all our routers and you don't

1682
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:41,299
send it to the that group your yeah but

1683
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:43,490
that's that that's exactly where I don't

1684
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:46,370
want wanted for privacy purposes because

1685
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:48,650
it's not on all nodes yet if you have a

1686
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:52,519
privacy address you're at least a little

1687
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:56,360
bit private still there right he's a

1688
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:57,710
private so this is actually the exact

1689
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,329
reason for why original we were

1690
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:03,349
proposing to

1691
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:05,750
off of death because anybody that cares

1692
01:27:03,349 --> 01:27:10,809
about that good ok routers could

1693
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:13,849
essentially which has to be anyways yeah

1694
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:17,239
like anybody that's listening to old dad

1695
01:27:13,849 --> 01:27:20,119
is listening to all the dresses ok so as

1696
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:25,839
a quick question can we call for

1697
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:25,839
adoption oh they think not very quiet

1698
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:34,579
all on the list but when we ask for a

1699
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:39,760
sense of the room do you think this is

1700
01:27:34,579 --> 01:27:39,759
something that we could have done if so

1701
01:27:58,659 --> 01:28:04,339
which one is it

1702
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:05,989
okay thank you and if somebody's in the

1703
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:07,639
jabba room that could be interesting if

1704
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:11,839
somebody replaced me when I'm speaking

1705
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:15,530
here I am single entity of myself I'm

1706
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:20,599
not the tickets okay anyway this draft

1707
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:22,429
is basically belonging to OPSEC we're to

1708
01:28:20,599 --> 01:28:25,820
two chairs are here so thank you for

1709
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:29,210
being here and supporting me fathers and

1710
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:31,460
basically it's as you can read we try to

1711
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:34,480
analyze all the operational security

1712
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:37,070
issue in several places in the network

1713
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:39,610
specific focus on service provider

1714
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:44,090
network enterprise network and

1715
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:47,058
residential as IOT is a very complex

1716
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:49,520
place we do not talk about it even if

1717
01:28:47,059 --> 01:28:52,719
some couple of thing we say in this

1718
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:55,909
document also applies to iot of you see

1719
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:58,579
and that's an informational draft and

1720
01:28:55,909 --> 01:29:00,710
what we want to do is basically I mean

1721
01:28:58,579 --> 01:29:03,920
all of us are doing v6 deployment how

1722
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:06,320
often do you get a all secure is it

1723
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,540
organized securely deploy my network so

1724
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,540
we try to put all things together there

1725
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:14,260
and our recommendation

1726
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:19,269
so now the bad news we are working on

1727
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:21,070
this since September 2012 I was not even

1728
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:23,800
the object chair that point of time you

1729
01:29:21,070 --> 01:29:27,330
were not even right so a long long time

1730
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:30,930
ago but still in the 21st century and

1731
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:34,360
basically it is quite a vast domain and

1732
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:36,120
it's a kind of moving target right with

1733
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,309
capital of people in this community

1734
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,809
discovering new security issue and so we

1735
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,260
need to update the draft and so on and

1736
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:44,590
so on

1737
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:48,070
as I said informational document it's

1738
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:50,200
quite long though 50 page and nothing

1739
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:52,690
and we are putting the record on all

1740
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:55,260
many reference we have in a reference

1741
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:57,969
section I counted them yesterday

1742
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:00,400
116 because basically the text says a

1743
01:29:57,970 --> 01:30:02,800
for this we briefly explain the issue

1744
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,839
and then we'll be fair basically to the

1745
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:08,050
RFC all the other documents that are not

1746
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:11,350
always AIT of documents by doing its

1747
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:17,250
consideration it's not recommendation by

1748
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:20,470
the way so the structure of the document

1749
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:23,470
the big part is about a generic security

1750
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:25,380
consideration and I shall come back on

1751
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:27,760
this on the next slide then we go

1752
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:29,920
capital of page 1 Enterprise I said

1753
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,160
capable of bridge on service provider

1754
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:35,740
where we talk about BGP about the

1755
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:38,710
transition mechanism including

1756
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:41,860
translation mechanism of course and Ally

1757
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:43,840
right I mean the service provider

1758
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:48,670
network and residential network we

1759
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:51,640
simply refer to those to RFC here the

1760
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:55,510
big chunk so is generic consideration

1761
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:59,230
and then we go and the first paragraph

1762
01:30:55,510 --> 01:31:01,150
was addressing architecture and at the

1763
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:03,429
beginning we were doing a lot of about

1764
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:05,320
ula now it's only one line basically

1765
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:08,410
because there's quite controversy there

1766
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:11,290
we talked about DHCP slack promise

1767
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:14,110
reconsideration next step is about

1768
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:16,570
extension headers orders how by up what

1769
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:19,660
we do with fragmentation and refer to

1770
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:22,570
your draft link layer security what

1771
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:23,750
about new discovery of course what about

1772
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:27,400
rogue array and

1773
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:30,590
so on fewer to about three GBP as well

1774
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:32,030
control plane security it's easier

1775
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:35,510
because it's mostly the same in a PV for

1776
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:37,130
ipv6 so that that's easy we only expect

1777
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:39,230
from is what we call the packet

1778
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:42,920
exception this is when we need basically

1779
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:44,719
to send the packet to the CPU okay which

1780
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:48,350
has some time different compare v4 and

1781
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:50,720
v6 rotting security basically explaining

1782
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:53,330
what we can do there about the routing

1783
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:57,170
update the rod filtering or refer to

1784
01:31:53,330 --> 01:32:00,019
this RFC 6060 six about the DCR prefix

1785
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:01,760
for instance everything about the

1786
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:04,910
transition techniques you a stack and

1787
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:08,390
capsulation translation we even kept

1788
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:10,519
Terra dos and six to four even if nobody

1789
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:12,710
is using it because when we talk to

1790
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:14,690
customers and people do bring it the

1791
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:16,220
questions still pop up and it's

1792
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:21,099
communicated those two has been made

1793
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:21,100
history and sharing device hardening

1794
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:29,480
where we are so we are revision 17 a

1795
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:33,010
thing or whatever obviously as you said

1796
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:36,320
some section we're quite controversial

1797
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:38,600
right I mean I see at least one somebody

1798
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:41,000
in the room here another lady in the end

1799
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:45,050
and Tim shown is not here but many

1800
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:48,290
people has provided feedback plug it and

1801
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:51,140
we listen to this right so we basically

1802
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:52,880
now counting the text you elaine only

1803
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:56,090
nothing we don't talk about p i versus

1804
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:58,130
PA for instance we'd try to talk to take

1805
01:32:56,090 --> 01:33:00,740
into account all the consideration that

1806
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:03,200
will raise on them in english in a

1807
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:07,010
previous review in this group couple of

1808
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:12,080
years ago so we think we are now in a

1809
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:13,640
reasonable shape here capital of

1810
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,650
acknowledgment and i think many people

1811
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:18,800
in this room up out there that's all the

1812
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:22,009
people sending review comments thank you

1813
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:25,400
again we have requested

1814
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:26,630
looking group last call to Jen and and

1815
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,210
run through the optech working group

1816
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:32,210
share they want to talk to us to me I

1817
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:34,760
guess before doing this so we'll do it

1818
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:37,550
later this week Matt as an author I

1819
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:40,110
would love to get as well we will go

1820
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:44,160
if everything is okay working group last

1821
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:47,730
Conan OPSEC but in this case it's also

1822
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:50,280
v6 so while we do the group last goal in

1823
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:53,370
OPSEC it would be nice for the authors

1824
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:57,389
that you also do the review here okay

1825
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:58,740
because that's observed roar and v6 so I

1826
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:59,520
hope that we'll get some people

1827
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:02,639
reviewing it

1828
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,130
I understand it's 50 page so it takes

1829
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,900
some times but it's really useful

1830
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:08,370
because after reading it and reading it

1831
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:11,639
I mean the authors we don't don't know

1832
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:15,240
anymore right okay so basically we have

1833
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:16,260
to get done thank you again and any

1834
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:21,900
questions

1835
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:23,700
nataly's Shredderman ripe ncc every ITF

1836
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:26,599
that there is a presentation about this

1837
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:32,490
draft I go to Mike I thank the alters

1838
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:34,560
maybe one or two cones no I'm done okay

1839
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:37,590
I read it again

1840
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,850
after the last revision it looks great

1841
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:41,970
thank you

1842
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:46,230
I would suggest neat last call and move

1843
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:49,820
on and maybe after eight years to be

1844
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:49,820
done Thanks Thank You Nathalie

1845
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:58,559
i I don't know if you have seen my last

1846
01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:01,620
email a couple of days ago I think

1847
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,890
basically it's done I ripped all the

1848
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:08,820
text again after the ITF in March and

1849
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:12,990
again last week there are just a couple

1850
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:15,570
of needs and I still disagree with not

1851
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:18,510
differentiating between Matty and me

1852
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:21,090
because they are somehow different from

1853
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:23,820
the perspective of security and then I

1854
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:28,260
think the other comment was there is

1855
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:30,740
nothing about the DNS proxy problem if

1856
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:33,480
you don't have a DNS proxy in the CPS

1857
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:36,840
you need clarification we can talk about

1858
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:38,490
this by email I think it's simple to do

1859
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,140
add some text on that okay anyway thank

1860
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:42,150
you for your email with it's not time

1861
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:43,620
yet to react on it and I don't

1862
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:47,250
understand indeed your DNS proxy so you

1863
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,050
need to talk I mean I think your

1864
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:50,969
strategy of trying to change nothing is

1865
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:52,739
good if

1866
01:35:50,969 --> 01:35:55,860
one reports anything with any text

1867
01:35:52,739 --> 01:35:59,009
delete the text set say okay it's out of

1868
01:35:55,860 --> 01:36:00,690
scope one thing you do need to delete is

1869
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:02,249
the reference to the ula usage

1870
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:03,210
considerations document because that

1871
01:36:02,249 --> 01:36:07,559
ain't happening

1872
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:09,479
yeah I've been open for years so it's

1873
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:11,820
off because like until that gets out of

1874
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:13,440
whatever until that makes it to RFC you

1875
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:16,829
can't publish this one anyway right yes

1876
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:19,199
all right that's right I was wondering

1877
01:36:16,829 --> 01:36:23,518
the same thing Renzo to be honest in my

1878
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:25,978
March review I provided a text about the

1879
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:29,010
ula that I think it will be better than

1880
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:31,349
deleting that you may want to reconsider

1881
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:35,219
that text please read it again

1882
01:36:31,349 --> 01:36:40,650
I usually don't want to touch you away

1883
01:36:35,219 --> 01:36:42,059
right for this one I think the text you

1884
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:43,469
have there for your lasers fine as long

1885
01:36:42,059 --> 01:36:45,599
as you delete the reference to the thing

1886
01:36:43,469 --> 01:36:53,630
that's not gonna get published okay

1887
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:53,630
thank you Oh maybe you can reach it so

1888
01:36:53,929 --> 01:36:59,639
question are you looking for comments to

1889
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:04,920
come to music stops really good outside

1890
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:08,880
I think if you can put OPSEC I mean it's

1891
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:10,800
up to the chair by the way here I would

1892
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:15,150
love this community to review it and

1893
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,710
send a comment to OPSEC right I mean all

1894
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:18,929
of us signed the same thing so we will

1895
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:20,400
see it anyway but put the name of the

1896
01:37:18,929 --> 01:37:21,690
draft there right that's the way when

1897
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:40,699
the meaning lists when you look in the

1898
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:40,699
archive is anybody else interested

1899
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:55,619
[Music]

1900
01:37:59,929 --> 01:38:07,280
going back to the agenda we have a

1901
01:38:04,730 --> 01:38:10,489
couple day to read things creative these

1902
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:27,429
things again I'm gonna let them look

1903
01:38:10,489 --> 01:38:30,858
some politics yeah for the one in your

1904
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:30,859
[Music]

1905
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:36,860
show okay

1906
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,770
my name is Uma I'm going to talk about

1907
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:44,059
is sv6 empty deployment considerations

1908
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:45,890
and I thanked her kindly agreeing to put

1909
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:48,040
this because they asked me to send an

1910
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:50,960
email I could not send I was traveling

1911
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:54,320
but I promise after this meeting I will

1912
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:56,750
send an email with the document and on

1913
01:38:54,320 --> 01:39:00,460
my comments if you have any things I

1914
01:38:56,750 --> 01:39:04,760
want to ask I will send it so this is

1915
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:11,030
regarding the ISIS protocol for v6 only

1916
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:12,949
topology or multi topology ok this work

1917
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:15,019
has been presented in LSR working group

1918
01:39:12,949 --> 01:39:17,839
in idea for node 3 based on the feedback

1919
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:19,820
and suggestions we are presenting in v6

1920
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,679
operation some of the people said that

1921
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:24,170
you know this is no document is required

1922
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:25,270
we don't want to do LS our working group

1923
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:27,920
doesn't want to do deployment

1924
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:29,840
considerations document some of the

1925
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,750
things are known and you know that kind

1926
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,969
of stuff so I just wanted to know your

1927
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:38,390
feedback if this is a known thing that's

1928
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:40,280
fine otherwise we want to think we think

1929
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:42,170
that it's good to document what is there

1930
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:45,500
out there we are not changing anything

1931
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:49,100
in the protocol so background there are

1932
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:50,870
a lot of IP ipv4 ISS deployments a few

1933
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,610
more folks are seeking ipv6 only

1934
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:56,719
deployments the first thing I worked in

1935
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:59,150
2012 me my world employer we started

1936
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:00,530
looking at ipv6 only deployments still

1937
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:03,199
it's happening the questions are the

1938
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:05,809
same we are amazed but you know but this

1939
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:08,388
is the that this is the fact so this is

1940
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:10,940
based on talks with multiple operators

1941
01:40:08,389 --> 01:40:13,599
most of the things we are looking at it

1942
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:15,098
is right now mobile backhaul

1943
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:17,409
we're for fighting services are being

1944
01:40:15,099 --> 01:40:19,960
deployed people are thinking about ipv6

1945
01:40:17,409 --> 01:40:22,659
only some people are looking for sr v6

1946
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:25,810
and folks are in l3 DC underlay is

1947
01:40:22,659 --> 01:40:27,129
looking for v6 only deployments so

1948
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:29,679
what's the goal and what can be done

1949
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:31,960
goal of this degree this document is to

1950
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:35,320
lay out the nuances around Isis and ipv6

1951
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:37,230
there are a lot of options with ISS how

1952
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:39,460
one can apply one can deploy with ipv6

1953
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:41,468
the first thing I wanted to clarify is

1954
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:45,880
is is multi topology is not equal to

1955
01:40:41,469 --> 01:40:48,310
ipv6 it's one way of deploying ipv6 the

1956
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:50,290
second thing is provide various options

1957
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:52,770
and limitations with eius eius for

1958
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:57,579
transitioning to ipv4 to ipv6 and

1959
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:59,050
looking for ipv6 only deployments so it

1960
01:40:57,579 --> 01:41:00,670
doesn't provide this document doesn't

1961
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:03,849
provide any protocol extensions it's

1962
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:06,190
only it's just it's what is there over

1963
01:41:03,849 --> 01:41:08,110
the last 10-15 years what happened in is

1964
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:11,799
critical it's a documentation of fourth

1965
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:13,179
and one sis non-goal there is ISS multi

1966
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:15,070
topology there are a lot of use cases

1967
01:41:13,179 --> 01:41:17,409
even the developers even the people who

1968
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:19,179
are writing the drafts get confused to

1969
01:41:17,409 --> 01:41:21,219
what empty can do and what cannot do

1970
01:41:19,179 --> 01:41:22,840
there can be lot of things that can be

1971
01:41:21,219 --> 01:41:24,790
done with empty but we are not going to

1972
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,900
empty what can be done and the

1973
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:32,409
exhaustive use cases around empty

1974
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:35,138
okay ipv6 in ISS primarily there are two

1975
01:41:32,409 --> 01:41:37,509
ways to do ipv6 and ISS one is ipv6

1976
01:41:35,139 --> 01:41:39,550
first introduced in five 3:08 RFC

1977
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:42,250
five-30 eight there's a new reachable

1978
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:44,500
TTL we TLB 236 it works on a single

1979
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:47,650
topology mode that means one decision

1980
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,329
process happens that is one SPF happens

1981
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:51,519
and you get come you get to compute both

1982
01:41:49,329 --> 01:41:54,429
ipv4 routes and ipv6 routes and download

1983
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:56,590
to the fav so there is that's the one

1984
01:41:54,429 --> 01:41:58,719
thing and there is a limitation there is

1985
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:59,440
a condition there how this works I will

1986
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,619
come to that later

1987
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:05,980
later on RFC Phi 1 to 0 introduces ISS

1988
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:08,440
multi topology this brings back brings

1989
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:11,320
two topologies specific edition seasoned

1990
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:14,769
topologies specific decision process

1991
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:18,400
there is TLB 22 added for a high density

1992
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:20,380
LV and TLB to 35 to 37 arid for Monty

1993
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,900
topology TLB where each ability ipv6

1994
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:24,309
addresses can be advertised so as I set

1995
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:26,079
up all the decision process topology

1996
01:42:24,309 --> 01:42:27,270
specific decision process that is a very

1997
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:30,699
multi topology you have

1998
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:32,800
ispf complication happens and the main

1999
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:35,169
computer main thing is here MPI d2 is

2000
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,150
reserved for ipv6 routing topology and

2001
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:39,670
this is where most of the SS empty

2002
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:42,849
deployments are seen basically is empty

2003
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:44,739
is used only for MK ID - it's a safe

2004
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:48,190
alternative deploy ipv6 in the legacy

2005
01:42:44,739 --> 01:42:51,159
networks so what's the problem with RFC

2006
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:53,860
Phi 3 0 it only thing is it's very

2007
01:42:51,159 --> 01:42:55,839
simple ipv6 we just read T 1 TL v TL B

2008
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:57,790
236 you are good to go but the only

2009
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,770
condition is the whole network should be

2010
01:42:57,790 --> 01:43:02,290
congruent that means all the all the

2011
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:05,800
nodes and links have both v4 and v6

2012
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:08,500
should be unable in sync as a simple

2013
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:11,530
example here let's say a network bitten

2014
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:14,199
like this everything is v4 and v6 but

2015
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:17,080
between RX and not to only v4 is enable

2016
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:18,940
what happens is in this case in the RFC

2017
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:20,889
five-30 it is a single topology mode

2018
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:25,900
even though there is an alternate path

2019
01:43:20,889 --> 01:43:28,659
between r1 RX r 1 r y r2 but the

2020
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:30,400
shortest path is between RX + r2 so it

2021
01:43:28,659 --> 01:43:32,739
tries to get this and you know that you

2022
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:36,250
look at a black hole so basically you're

2023
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:36,879
routing gets black hole here so that's

2024
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:39,280
the problem

2025
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,320
so basically for RFC five-30 it's single

2026
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,719
topology mode to work all the links and

2027
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:45,940
node should have before and v6 so how

2028
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:49,030
this gets fixed either you can enable v6

2029
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:51,159
on that link or you can switch to RFC 5

2030
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:53,290
and to zero where you can do mt ID -

2031
01:43:51,159 --> 01:43:56,019
because decision process is different

2032
01:43:53,290 --> 01:44:00,489
there so you don't have to worry about

2033
01:43:56,020 --> 01:44:02,050
anything there so there is a single

2034
01:44:00,489 --> 01:44:04,928
topology mode with multiple address

2035
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:06,400
families so we we talked about this

2036
01:44:04,929 --> 01:44:09,850
restrictions network must be congruent

2037
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:11,259
we have seen this and some examples

2038
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:13,330
where this is not possible

2039
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:14,980
when ipv6 is getting introduced in the

2040
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:17,620
networks and legacy nodes does not

2041
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:19,320
support ipv6 our implementation issues

2042
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:21,519
causing the ipv6 to be disabled or

2043
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:23,799
Hardware scale limitations causing that

2044
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,409
p v6 to be persons or low-end devices so

2045
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:29,620
all these cases forced people to think -

2046
01:44:26,409 --> 01:44:31,960
is SMT but still people are using this

2047
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:33,969
and we get questions even after after 8

2048
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:36,400
years of my bus first question I got it

2049
01:44:33,969 --> 01:44:37,900
from 2011 and still like I get this

2050
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:42,420
questions actual is that's the reason we

2051
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:44,400
wrote this document so in out on is SM

2052
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:46,740
here single adjacency with multiple

2053
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:49,019
empty IDs in the edges NC you list all

2054
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:51,269
the empty IDs you support and MK ID

2055
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:54,080
specific decision process done and the

2056
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:57,150
common repent Feb but the thing is MT ID

2057
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:59,190
deployments only MT ID to is only seen

2058
01:44:57,150 --> 01:45:01,019
because a lot of implementations lot of

2059
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:02,910
the big vendors don't support at that

2060
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:06,810
multi are the topologies in empty that's

2061
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:08,400
one of the problems with empty okay so

2062
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:10,370
the one of the another confusion with

2063
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:13,230
Isis is all around with the technology

2064
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:15,780
now we can see that multi topologies it

2065
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:17,549
says that MT ID 2 is reserved for ipv6

2066
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:19,889
routing topology but rather they should

2067
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:22,170
have said that this address family there

2068
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:23,730
is no distinction between utters family

2069
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:25,110
and topology there it's all mixed up

2070
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:27,089
there with the terminology this caused a

2071
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:29,120
lot of confusion even though a lot of

2072
01:45:27,090 --> 01:45:32,340
questions comes because of this fact so

2073
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:35,400
so yes MT can be used for other than

2074
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:37,980
ipv6 routing topology if you want 84 you

2075
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:39,750
can do whatever you want another ipv6

2076
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:42,179
routing topology maybe they wanted to

2077
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:45,060
say that as this is the first routing

2078
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:47,460
topology with ipv6 it's a tiring

2079
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:50,190
conversation if you want ipv6 only use

2080
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:52,350
MK ID - I don't want multi topology I

2081
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:54,540
just want single topology ipv6 only I

2082
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:56,010
want but still you how to use empty ID -

2083
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:58,980
because as a result ipv6 routing

2084
01:45:56,010 --> 01:46:00,990
topology ok one of the goal of this talk

2085
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:05,070
when to use this conversation another

2086
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:07,380
deployment notice as I said lot of with

2087
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:10,650
big vendors don't support multiple

2088
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:12,510
topologies generously there are other

2089
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:15,089
ways to do this if you have interest I

2090
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:19,050
can talk to you guys but this is the

2091
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:20,730
fact so in summary this document only

2092
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:23,010
provides various options available for

2093
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:25,379
ipv6 only deployment or transition to

2094
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:27,780
ipv4 to v6 and what are the pitfalls to

2095
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:30,000
avoid maybe this is known to a lot of

2096
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:31,590
people but you know this is not thing

2097
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,020
thought I got and I ever haven't we

2098
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:38,220
talking to customers and demystifies

2099
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:39,780
what's been out there in is SMT and any

2100
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:45,180
comments feedback I will happy to take

2101
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:53,000
and we are looking to ask for adoption

2102
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:53,000
in LS are working group LS are working

2103
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:59,410
so one of the ellis our feedback I got

2104
01:46:55,989 --> 01:47:01,509
was is is ipv6 all done in 1195 ahrefs

2105
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:03,849
1195 and they don't want to do

2106
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:05,770
deployment guides because it's a known

2107
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:07,810
issue so many things they are tied up

2108
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:09,280
there even I didn't put multi topology

2109
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:11,710
transition there is another confusion

2110
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:14,559
there so all these are documented in I

2111
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:16,900
thought it will be useful but it's up to

2112
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,800
the folks here also I will get the

2113
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:20,949
feedback from here

2114
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,810
okay so I'll ask you the same question I

2115
01:47:20,949 --> 01:47:25,809
asked your where do you want feedback

2116
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:26,860
I won't feedback from here v6 operations

2117
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:28,840
because these are the folks who are

2118
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:31,599
deploying ipv6 only Network are

2119
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:33,160
transitioning to ipv4 to b6 so you guys

2120
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:37,440
might have faced some of these problems

2121
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:37,440
or you might have work around sunny no

2122
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:43,690
no v6 I will send a mail to the v6 ops

2123
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:48,489
and if you can send the feedback in the

2124
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:50,080
basics yes that will be useful and that

2125
01:47:48,489 --> 01:47:52,629
will be useful for me to say that I

2126
01:47:50,080 --> 01:48:02,790
presented this in v6 ops and this is the

2127
01:47:52,630 --> 01:48:02,790
feedback I got okay so one please

2128
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:18,129
summarize does anybody wish to do a

2129
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:22,300
manual review of the document I don't

2130
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:25,780
see them so you wonder if you will

2131
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:41,440
summarize any comments we go thank you

2132
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:45,489
so much okay thank you this and she

2133
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:48,429
grabs yeah what do you want to do I can

2134
01:48:45,489 --> 01:48:51,070
I can go to that one very quickly just

2135
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:56,650
to to get comments in the lists

2136
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:59,769
hopefully okay so I started this this

2137
01:48:56,650 --> 01:49:01,839
work something like 10 years ago but at

2138
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:04,780
that time we didn't we didn't jump it

2139
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:09,249
into into it actually

2140
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:11,829
the main point is that when you read the

2141
01:49:09,249 --> 01:49:15,010
document about how you do point-to-point

2142
01:49:11,829 --> 01:49:18,489
links it looks like it's recommending a

2143
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:20,260
slash 127 but actually this is not what

2144
01:49:18,489 --> 01:49:23,018
the document says what the document says

2145
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:26,260
is that routers must support it so I am

2146
01:49:23,019 --> 01:49:30,280
trying to clarify that here especially

2147
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:32,979
because almost 70% of the networks are

2148
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:35,619
using a different way so we should

2149
01:49:32,979 --> 01:49:38,590
document in basic sub Scotties actively

2150
01:49:35,619 --> 01:49:41,369
being used in the network right the

2151
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:45,479
resource another point here which is

2152
01:49:41,369 --> 01:49:49,239
supported by RFC six60 three which is

2153
01:49:45,479 --> 01:49:52,150
exclude option for as last 64 from a

2154
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:54,070
bigger prefix so you have well actually

2155
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:56,920
shorter prefix if you have for example

2156
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:59,320
as last 48 for a customer you can use

2157
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,820
the first slash 64 for the

2158
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:03,820
point-to-point link and this is not

2159
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:05,619
documented anywhere its reference it as

2160
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,780
something that can be done because you

2161
01:50:05,619 --> 01:50:09,909
have the exclude option in dhcpv6

2162
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:12,759
perfect delegation but it's actually not

2163
01:50:09,909 --> 01:50:15,909
documented and a lot of people is using

2164
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:18,039
that so what I am what I am trying to do

2165
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:20,829
in the in the draft is describing the

2166
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:24,639
different choices that you have for the

2167
01:50:20,829 --> 01:50:29,289
point-to-point link good things and bad

2168
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:31,179
things from its bond and also the

2169
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:34,210
numbering ways so for example you can

2170
01:50:31,179 --> 01:50:37,719
use global unicast you can use your leis

2171
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:40,630
you can use a number it which is a link

2172
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:43,599
local and so on so that's basically what

2173
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:46,389
the draft is describing all those are

2174
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:48,340
used by different ISPs but we don't have

2175
01:50:46,389 --> 01:50:51,010
a real document which is describing all

2176
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:53,199
the choices okay so most of the time

2177
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:55,449
when when you get questions from ISPs

2178
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:57,428
how I do that you don't have a single

2179
01:50:55,449 --> 01:50:59,409
document to reference everything like

2180
01:50:57,429 --> 01:51:03,610
that and some of the possibilities are

2181
01:50:59,409 --> 01:51:07,058
not documented in any way so that's

2182
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:11,259
basically it I got some comments from

2183
01:51:07,059 --> 01:51:13,570
Eric one week ago it's true that the

2184
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:15,969
draft goes dormant for one year because

2185
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:18,219
I didn't have time to date it but I plan

2186
01:51:15,969 --> 01:51:20,619
to to have a new update in

2187
01:51:18,219 --> 01:51:22,210
one or two weeks taking consideration

2188
01:51:20,619 --> 01:51:24,989
Eric comments and if there are other

2189
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:24,989
comments as well

2190
01:51:25,150 --> 01:51:30,400
so you're missing at least one option

2191
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:35,280
which is to assign a 64 to a router and

2192
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:37,900
assign 128 out of that 64 2 links oh

2193
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:40,929
yeah that's that's another one yeah

2194
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:43,799
thank you I will consider that please

2195
01:51:40,929 --> 01:52:00,010
send send something into the list okay

2196
01:51:43,800 --> 01:52:02,260
thank you so again sang with this

2197
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:03,999
document it has been dormant for one

2198
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:06,429
year one year more or less I didn't have

2199
01:52:03,999 --> 01:52:09,789
it sufficient time to take over it and

2200
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:11,440
at that time it was not considered by

2201
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:13,960
the working group but this is a

2202
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:17,259
discussion that that we have every two

2203
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:18,969
three months actually I think two weeks

2204
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:22,090
ago we had the same discussion in the

2205
01:52:18,969 --> 01:52:24,639
list so in other working groups we have

2206
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:27,070
definition sort of terminology we don't

2207
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:29,769
have that here and this is a very simple

2208
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:32,499
different definition about what is

2209
01:52:29,769 --> 01:52:34,809
native good Teesside tv6 only and that's

2210
01:52:32,499 --> 01:52:36,699
the goal of the document so let's try to

2211
01:52:34,809 --> 01:52:39,190
speak the same language because we are

2212
01:52:36,699 --> 01:52:41,409
confusing people that's that's it

2213
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:44,860
I I don't think I need to go through the

2214
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:46,388
slides this is so simple like that we

2215
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:48,339
you may agree or not with this

2216
01:52:46,389 --> 01:52:52,090
definition that's the reason we need to

2217
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:56,729
work on that okay and that's it thank

2218
01:52:52,090 --> 01:52:56,729
you go to the list please

2219
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:27,040
with that I guess we're adjourned

2220
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:45,700
I want you
