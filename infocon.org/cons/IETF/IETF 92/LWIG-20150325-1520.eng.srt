9
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,490
meeting material and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jabba room and</font>

10
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,920
the blue sheets or should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

11
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,660
around and again if if you get up to the

<font color="#CCCCCC">might to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak please speak clearly and</font>

13
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:24,120
state your name thank you so here's the

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,800
agenda I don't the any do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,300
any agenda bashing on this anyone have

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,300
any other items they want to talk about

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay hearing on so i'll just quickly</font>

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,039
give a quick update on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,869
status so the l word cellular document

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,479
so there's a working group last call

21
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,040
issued there was little response on the

22
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,509
mailing list but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> objections</font>

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:55,380
so assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a tacit approval and so</font>

24
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,630
therefore will advance the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document with</font>

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy efficient draft there's a</font>

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,990
presentation today from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlos is he</font>

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,220
here yep yeah and I guess that'll I

28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,630
think he asks at the end whether he

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,288
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for work and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> written as</font>

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,269
cool as the eye could be too minimal so

31
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,859
Tara I'll piss you this document and

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,110
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has been around for a long</font>

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,550
time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'd suggest this goes to</font>

34
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,550
working group last call immediately

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,660
after this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is any</font>

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:29,640
objections to that so i'll post on the

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:33,269
mailing list there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expired</font>

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,829
documents there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> el hueco app which I</font>

39
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,030
think Matthias is just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a a</font>

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,170
quick presentation on all those are

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,380
going to present on<font color="#CCCCCC"> each it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">make some discussion on this and TLS</font>

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,900
minimal again I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,010
just a hangover from where we were in

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,010
Honolulu really so I don't that has been

46
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,929
any change to that not Allison shaking

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:01,730
his head<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first presentation</font>

48
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,730

49
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:18,110
thank you good afternoon my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font>

51
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,220
update on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft entitled energy</font>

52
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,738
efficient implementation of ITF

<font color="#CCCCCC">constraint protocol suite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also known as</font>

54
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy efficient draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font>

55
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,780
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the status</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

56
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:38,299
document this draft was last updated

57
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,840
around three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago this last version</font>

58
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:44,510
which is dash 02 intends to incorporate

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,359
the feedback collected during the last

60
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,480
ITF meeting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honolulu in which there</font>

61
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:54,049
were several useful comments given by

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,810
people so thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this the main</font>

63
00:03:54,049 --> 00:04:00,409
additions in this new version can be

64
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:03,739
found in sections<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and six and also</font>

65
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:07,970
several minor changes have been done

66
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:10,760
throughout the whole document so let's

67
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:16,339
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of more detail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

68
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:18,440
these changes in section 3 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

69
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,810
section which focuses on radio duty

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,199
cycling techniques there is a new

71
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,789
subsection 3 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entitled through this</font>

72
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,750
is for completeness because for instance

73
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:33,139
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same section there was section</font>

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:37,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 dot to focusing on the impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of radio</font>

75
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:39,789
duty cycling on latency and buffering so

76
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,169
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> added this section on throughput</font>

77
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:43,849
acknowledging in the text that this is

78
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,310
not typically a key concern in

79
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,289
constrained no networks however it's

80
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:53,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">still important in some services such as</font>

81
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:57,800
over here software update or also when

82
00:04:53,139 --> 00:05:00,650
sensors which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> offline mostly have</font>

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,599
some short opportunity for transferring

84
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,320
measurements which have been accumulated

85
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:09,050
during this offline period also we state

86
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,580
the radio duty cycling leads to yet

87
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,250
another trade off

88
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">time is between energy consumption and</font>

89
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,409
throughput another change is new

90
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,409
subsection 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> that forum titled radio</font>

91
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:23,810
interface tuning however most of the

92
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,870
text here is text which was previously

93
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,199
in section 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two in the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> draft</font>

94
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">version and this change has been done</font>

95
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,090
mainly to achieve a better document

96
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:37,759
organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also there is some</font>

97
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:41,198
additional sentence<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to make a more</font>

98
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,750
smooth transition to the next subsection

99
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,729
so this next subsection is three dot

100
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">five which corresponds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the old</font>

101
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:53,508
section 303 this is the section focusing

102
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,110
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Power Save services available in</font>

103
00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:00,860
example low-power radios and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font>

104
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:04,789
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this section is in subsection</font>

105
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:08,240
3 dot five dot one in which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

106
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:11,840
deleted the V in the title if the title

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're used to to be bullied it could</font>

read powersave services in 802 11 b

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,830
however we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> added some text on the</font>

110
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:23,840
power save mode which has been was

111
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,440
actually defined in the very first

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,810
version of the 80 to the 11th standard

113
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:35,000
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also important here so now this</font>

114
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:38,360
subsection has a more generic form<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,419
another section with some changes in

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,460
section 6 which focuses on application

117
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:48,109
layer now there is some structure added

118
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,029
to the document the sense that

119
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,180
previously there were no subsections

120
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:55,759
here now we have tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organize a bit</font>

121
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,460
better the content with these three

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,000
subsections six dot one entitled

123

in subsection 6 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1623 is the same as</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous drug version and the</font>

128
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,430
changes are mostly in subsection 6 the

00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:22,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">two where we have other</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to the publish-subscribe</font>

131
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:30,299
draft also we mentioned the OMA I'd wear

132
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:33,060
them to mq load and also we mentioned

133
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,010
the one in 2m quad binding with an

134
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">application-layer mechanism for slipping</font>

135
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:41,520
notes so other<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes applied to the</font>

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,880
document comprise the following if you

137
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">recall there was section</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 focusing on</font>

138
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,060
cross near issues which was almost empty

139
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,820
and in fact the consensus in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honolulu</font>

140
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,470
was to remove this section so it has

141
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,530
been removed in this last version

142
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,560
nevertheless<font color="#CCCCCC"> there still we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

143
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,489
incorporated a comment from Dominique

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,530
who mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it could be useful</font>

145
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:11,670
positive to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have good interfaces between</font>

146
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,229
layers anyway and other minor changes

147
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,650
have been applied<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout the</font>

148
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:19,110
document mainly verifications also

149
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:23,130
editorial improvements and a couple of

150
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:26,040
new references which have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> added so</font>

151
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">after these changes we believe that the</font>

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,380
document is mostly ready so you would

153
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,120
like to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chairs weather is</font>

154
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:39,000
possible to issue a working group last

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,190
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to answer</font>

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,809
question to the room do does the room

157
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,270
think this document is ready for working

158
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:48,569
group last call first of all who's

159
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:52,590
actually read the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

160
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:55,500
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so come workout questions</font>

161
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,990
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean battle a rain placement</font>

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:03,240
named Dominic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read the document i find</font>

163
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,380
it excellent very lots of useful

164
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,960
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good work</font>

165
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:15,430
I have to suggestions one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 15 dot</font>

166
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">for in you describe the TCH mechanism I</font>

167
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,530
think unless you have another opinion

168
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,370
just to be fair the SME should be

169
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,680
mentioned as well it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quiet I</font>

170
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,960
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are six dish work group</font>

171
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,989
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups as knows its image</font>

172
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,000
working group so I don't know if you

173
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,230
have any opening that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry care</font>

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,940
but the SME if it doesn't then find drop

175
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:48,260
jessamy but I'm mature and the second

176
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:51,290
appointment oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bocelli</font>

177
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:55,280
in the document as well and as a cover

178
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,079
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dect ule draft I if time permits I</font>

179
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,370
would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to add a section</font>

180
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:04,520
on on deck tivoli as well just to have a

181
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,040
complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture so I know then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

182
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,210
the onus of providing text we try to do

183
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but okay I don't want to delay in</font>

184
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the document otherwise okay thank you</font>

185
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much</font>

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,500
okay well if if those that can be

187
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,650
incorporated in quickly then do you

188
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,510
think it's worth incorporating those if

189
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,010
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done quickly do you think</font>

190
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,390
it's worth incorporating those as well

191
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we okay anything yes okay so if</font>

192
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:50,080
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Dominique that'd be good</font>

193
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:59,300
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so thank you very much the</font>

194
00:10:50,080 --> 00:11:02,660
next item is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthias could</font>

195
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,760
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got 10 minutes to just</font>

196
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,760
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about la Cour</font>

197
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:20,079
yes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually there haven't been any</font>

198
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:22,179
changes since last meeting the main

199
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,670
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had back then already was that</font>

200
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:27,610
there was no feedback from the mailing

201
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,049
list or from anyone else my question

202
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,319
here with me who in this room has

203
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:40,929
implemented co-op at least once or half

204
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:44,410
time actually quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people it</font>

205
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:46,269
would be really nice if you would send a

206
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,610
comment to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list so I can</font>

207
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,699
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you or even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better if you</font>

208
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,230
actually have input on what were the

209
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:56,170
challenges so where did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you struggle</font>

210
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,360
where did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a quite</font>

211
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,089
interesting solution to these problems

212
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,730
to actually integrate that you have

213
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:05,019
actually committed implementation

214
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,329
guidance we want to have in this

215
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:13,720
document okay so yeah please do that and

216
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:15,519
from there we go then move on past I

217
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,309
guess because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there is nothing more</font>

218
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should come too okay I'd</font>

219
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,059
suggest you know putting a request down

220
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:27,129
on the mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the client</font>

221
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,868
they call mailing list as well so

222
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:30,459
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

223
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:37,089
have implemented probably follow a core

224
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:39,959
more than L week certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

225
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,959
heinous you're up next

226
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:57,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about</font>

227
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:04,240
performance analysis i did with a

228
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:05,739
co-worker of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> manuel and excite so a</font>

229
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,579
little bit about the motivation of why i

230
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:12,119
had been actually working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

231
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:17,309
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meanwhile expired elevate document</font>

232
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:20,529
initially contains guidance and also

233
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:23,199
performance figures so if you if you

234
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,639
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up try to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the expired version</font>

235
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,459
that's what you're going to find in

236
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,339
there but in the meanwhile<font color="#E5E5E5"> um after the</font>

237
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:33,638
work was started<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dice group was</font>

238
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:36,790
formed in air we had the dtls dls

239
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,379
profile document work going on there and

240
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,540
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the guidance actually moved</font>

241
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:42,610
ultimately over there and was expand

242
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,959
later on and the document pass working

243
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:49,569
google scholar raining and what it does

244
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,138
it the dice document as you know has

245
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:55,240
looks at different credential types and

246
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:57,670
also looks at different communication

247
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,350
patterns and looks at different

248
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,349
extensions and so a question that comes

249
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,299
up is quite often is like what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

250
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,350
really cost and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this week</font>

251
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:13,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've heard a couple of x percent as</font>

252
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,139
claiming that we can't do public key

253
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,480
crypto on<font color="#CCCCCC"> io t devices and so on and and</font>

254
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:22,299
of course this the answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of</font>

255
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,170
what IOT devices can do and cannot do is

256
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:28,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated and even the former</font>

257
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,209
presenter hear about energy efficiency

258
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,910
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously this is not a yes or no</font>

259
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:39,998
question but body abroad I question that

260
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:43,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">has a more complex answer and in order</font>

261
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide better performance data for</font>

262
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:48,549
the dls minimum document to actually

263
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,459
make an<font color="#E5E5E5"> informed decision about which</font>

264
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,610
features you should actually be looking

265
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:57,239
into I was

266
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,760
is a permanent performance analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

267
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:05,250
to actually enhance what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already in</font>

268
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,829
there and in half just better data and

269
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,839
that's what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I'm going to</font>

270
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to you about the status of that</font>

271
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,350
investigation and ultimately I hope that

272
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:20,640
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can help me doing that work</font>

273
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:22,440
so um data we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have is we</font>

274
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,890
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what is that the code</font>

275
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,560
size typically coat will end up in flash

276
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:32,579
and how much code size to the different

277
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,469
extensions actually need the message

278
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,500
size and a communication overhead is

279
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,940
important to some of you specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

280
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,579
you use some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the low-power radio</font>

281
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,019
technologies who have a very small n tu

282
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,819
sais but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of extension work going</font>

283
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,420
into that to reduce the size of the

284
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,260
messages overall cpu performance is

285
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,550
important our energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumption</font>

286
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:00,750
referring back to the earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> god and</font>

287
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,359
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usage of ram so actually quite</font>

288
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:06,240
a bit of data and in this in stock I

289
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,290
focus on on a few of those unfortunately

290
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:15,149
you don't have data for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this year</font>

291
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it said most most engineers and</font>

292
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,310
product designers don't they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

293
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,990
have a rough estimate on what they can

294
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually choose the right</font>

295
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,260
platform rather than trying everything

296
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,300
out themselves which is a very

297
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,910
time-consuming process just<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling them</font>

298
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,319
use TLS and some of the extensions is

299
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:36,240
not not enough I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I said um</font>

300
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,990
there is already something in English

301
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,660
dls minimum a minimal document namely we

302
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">have code size of various basic building</font>

303
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:51,870
blocks cryptographic functions and so on

304
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:55,740
hey sm1 libraries etc but only from from

305
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,410
one single stack so we ideally want to

306
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,720
have data from from different

307
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,829
implementations so we have

308
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,829
more referencing representative coverage

309
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:10,329
there's memory information in the oven

310
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">on unfortunately only for the British</font>

312
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,629
elliptic curve cipher suites that we

313
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:23,290
also recommend in a profile document and

314
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">then for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a communication overhead</font>

315
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,580
there's only very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level information</font>

316
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:36,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're mostly focusing on the record</font>

317
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:38,889
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what we get is we've</font>

318
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,959
looked at in this in this specific case

319
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,000
on a symmetric crypto because it's

320
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
obviously buried in my are demanding

321
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,750
there's a little bit of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

322
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,560
symmetric rip<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn there but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you as</font>

323
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,510
you will see that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem at all</font>

324
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:56,230
we looked at a specific processor family

325
00:17:52,510 --> 00:18:00,040
in arm<font color="#CCCCCC"> processes and maybe some of you</font>

326
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,110
have time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at other processes and</font>

327
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,300
I know that some of you are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

328
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,300
other platforms and so that would be

329
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">good to have additional material and so</font>

330
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,840
in the next couple of slides I'm going

331
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,280
to explain you give it a background of

332
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,679
the measurements and what assumptions I

333
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,110
made what boards and processes I use and

334
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,720
then talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the actual performance</font>

335
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,530
data and so that the material in the

336
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,210
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should give you enough</font>

337
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,440
information to actually redo the test

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">year on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own to bury frightened okay</font>

339
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,670
um so the focus was my focus was on road

340
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,020
trip though at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

341
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product release changes although I</font>

342
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,800
will sort of talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of</font>

343
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,300
the presentation talk about the

344
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:48,760
relevance for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dls exchange as well I</font>

345
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,500
focused on eccie rather than RSA simply

346
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,400
because that's what we recommend in a

347
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:58,590
profile document we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't recommend ECC</font>

348
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,180
use so I didn't cover that and

349
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,429
specifically what I was interested in is

350
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,110
on the performance of the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ezz</font>

351
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,070
curves since this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an ongoing</font>

352
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,750

355
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered the classically curves and also</font>

356
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,440
did some preliminary work on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> curves</font>

357
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,169
that dan bernstein proposed curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> 255 19</font>

358
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,150
and particularly focused on runtime

359
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,160
performance rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

360
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,990
consumption or code size there's a

361
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,970
little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram usage in there but</font>

362
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:39,280
it's um it's yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in that fully</font>

363
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,020
complete data as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see in a</font>

the the the data I used open source code

on which has been renamed to embed pls

369
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:04,330
ack so that's so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually do the</font>

370
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:08,020
analysis yourself as well the only

371
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:10,030
caveat that curve to 55.9 test code is

372
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,270
actually not the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use for</font>

373
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:17,100
testing is not yet available publicly

374
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,100
because it's still in working<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress</font>

375
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,540
unfortunately none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ports that i</font>

376
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,640
have used has a hardware-based random

the performance numbers but for real

great<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea so keep that in mind</font>

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,460
well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

384
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,010
an area where we could do some further

385
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,410
development I'm just wondering it you

386
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,540
know can-can people who are versed in

387
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,790
security maybe school us a little bit on

388
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,010
what constitutes a good source of

389
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,620
entropy and is there a very cheap

390
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,360
solution that perhaps could be you know

391
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,370
maybe you're measuring thermal noise or

392
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,709
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just attach it to a GPIO</font>

393
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,189
pin what's the you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

394
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

395
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,250
the answer now but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thinking</font>

396
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an ongoing</font>

397
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,630
problem maybe it's one that we should

398
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,810
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's a good point so there's</font>

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF RFC that provides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,550

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,490
some hardware components in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I can be</font>

404
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,940
used so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be good to actually</font>

405
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,370
invite someone to just give a talk to us

406
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,250
and performance a little bit ideally

407
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,479
what you want to have is a

408
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,010
microprocessor that has already a random

409
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,660
number generator on board and so you

410
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,970
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and those</font>

411
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,240
exist they just didn't happen to be on

412
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,370
the parts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had here maybe I can</font>

413
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,220
give part of an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

414
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:56,570
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to measure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a thermal noise</font>

415
00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:00,560
in a resistance or diet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Junction a DA to</font>

416
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:03,310
D converter you need to have some gain

417
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,720
so if you have an operational amplifier

418
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:08,990
around your microcontroller you can use

419
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,910
your ID it is to measure no reason

420
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,280
that's a very good random number

421
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,410
generator you just need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> careful</font>

422
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't inject electronic noise</font>

423
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,560
from the power supply into your thermal

424
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,210
noise because then you get correlation

425
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,730
with the software activity of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> node</font>

426
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,890
so there's a little bit of decoupling of

427
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,500
the electronic circuitry to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

428
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,380
download I hear this works a small hands

429
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,380
on workshop next like that idea pdn a

430
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:42,310
certain sort of things together<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

431
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,310
quick sounds like a nice idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

432
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:51,300
so what I what I did on so obviously I

433
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,350

434
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:58,320
some processes and so they're different

435
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">arm processes assume a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> main oh so</font>

436
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,100
there's a cortex a series which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

437
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,830
your mobile phone tablet into your home

438
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,129
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dose I haven't used they have</font>

439
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,320
high performance they would have no

440
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,940
problem at all with any of the crypto

441
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,250
that you see which is loved it so I used

442
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cortex and processes which you find</font>

443
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,710
on many IOT devices if you look at the

444
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">derp derp derp downs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at the</font>

445
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:28,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that are you see indicated here</font>

446
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:32,400
from MC RM 0 plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> em series m3 m4 I</font>

447
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:36,330
didn't use 10-7 because I think it's

448
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,190
actually available in silicon via the

449
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,510
difference between them is as indicated

450
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:46,200
so there are trade-offs in terms of

451
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:50,610
energy efficiency cost and features it

452
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:54,560
so the ones that are enforced they are

453
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:58,800
they have floating-point units and

454
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,620
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more better cpu power and</font>

455
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,850
so and so you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the impact</font>

456
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:09,629
in the data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all of them are</font>

457
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:12,120
32-bit risc armed with processes it's

458
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably worth mentioning ECC on the m7</font>

459
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,520
doesn't mean elliptic curve does it he

460
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:21,149
had it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point si yeah yeah ECC</font>

461
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,418
doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little coffee okay</font>

462
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:27,059
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't use just a bra</font>

464
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,200

465
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:35,968
actually look at them the nice thing

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">about them is that normally for for</font>

467
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:41,070
experiments you already have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:42,869
bidding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pins there so you can even</font>

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,210
sense us on these sports and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

470
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:49,320
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ready ready to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

471
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:52,320
rather than building your system so so

472
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,529
it said previously I have basically the

473
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,559
full range of coverage and I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also</font>

474
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:00,719
have different boards with different cpu

475
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,529
speed so that there's a little bit of

476
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:07,469
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had i noticed that picture</font>

477
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:10,259
of my desk program if and as i explained

478
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:12,330
later if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM then</font>

479
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,659
you will not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some of the</font>

480
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,759
optimizations and then you are

481
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:22,080
unfortunate state we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

482
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:25,489
later ok so what curse that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look into</font>

483
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">it I'm and also a curse that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may see</font>

484
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:29,059
also being discussed in a transport

485
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:31,529
layer security working group

486
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:34,229
specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curves which are</font>

487
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">very popular with different key sizes so</font>

488
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:41,999
they have these funny names and the

489
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,580
number indicates the key length so we're

490
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:47,129
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Keela in a second the</font>

491
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,649
second type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> curves I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to look</font>

492
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:53,029
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the college curves followed by the</font>

493
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">German bring pool curves which also</font>

494
00:25:53,029 --> 00:26:00,299
standardized in as an IDF RFC and as I

495
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:02,219
said curve 255 not 19 which is a more

496
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:04,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">recent one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently under discussion</font>

497
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:08,460
and standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> efforts are ongoing</font>

498
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:12,719
so we'll see those from a recommendation

499
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:19,559
point of view coop coop recommends the

500
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:21,880
NIST curve 200 256 are one sorry Carolyn

501
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:27,520
again are these all on income

502
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:34,390
by IPR are any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them unencumbered by</font>

503
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,860
our prayer ah that's a difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah that</font>

504
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question that nobody in this room</font>

505
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,810
cannot so yeah exact however there is an

506
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:47,500
RFC RFC 60 mg which for well as some of

507
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,360
these curves actually shows that they

508
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,700
can be constructed from information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

509
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,060
was available before the year nineteen

510
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-four so if you know about petland</font>

511
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifetimes that if you are not a lawyer</font>

512
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,500
this should give you some influence if

513
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,050
you are a lawyer you know that law

514
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,390
little bit little bit more complicated

515
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:09,820
anyway so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons I</font>

516
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,610
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> why many people were quite</font>

517
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,919
comfortable with the mandatory to

518
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:24,780
implement choices for co web which is P

519
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:30,310
256 alius<font color="#E5E5E5"> seki 256 era one definitely um</font>

520
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:33,160
yeah okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah the note that the end the</font>

521
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">pips related specification also gives</font>

522
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,740
them a different sometimes gives them a

523
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,460
different names so you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> p and then</font>

524
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,040
followed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key line speed 256 so</font>

525
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,650
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> which document you read you</font>

526
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out which what it</font>

527
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,310
mastery so the Cobras curves are easy to

528
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,700
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it because they have the</font>

529
00:27:51,310 --> 00:28:00,030
cave at the end after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number versus</font>

530
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:03,280
they are in case of the nice curves um

531
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:07,690
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were so I'm talking also about a</font>

532
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,850
few optimizations those are the first

533
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,180
optimization and you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> references</font>

534
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">here for further details they are</font>

535
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,400
already described in case of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST</font>

536
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,449
optimization already described in this

537
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:24,240
specification itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

538
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously an obvious obvious thing to do</font>

539
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:32,350
and what is specific really does are in

540
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:35,530
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

541
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:39,090
the curse they some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

542
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:41,710
specially constructed and the primes are

543
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,949
specially constructed in such a way that

544
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:47,559
it makes the point multiplication<font color="#E5E5E5"> scalar</font>

545
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,390
multiplication faster and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

546
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,530
you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between the</font>

547
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:54,850
performance of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these different</font>

548
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:56,440
curves and so you need to look at if you

549
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,090
want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

550
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:04,179
optimization you go go and click<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

551
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:06,220
links um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST optimization basically</font>

552
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:08,110
uses the structure this special

553
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,850
structure of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prime the fixed point</font>

554
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,549
of dimensional optimization bring

555
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,918
computes points because it uses a more

556
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:17,500
efficient way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

557
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,200
multiplication and then the reduction so

558
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what in naively what you would do</font>

559
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,320
is I'm like in general like you you

560
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:29,770
multiply numbers anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

561
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like let's say number times X</font>

562
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:35,710
and then you would basically go and

563
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,570
multiply that point again and again and

564
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:41,919
again and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end you would</font>

565
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:46,840
reduce it back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the field you are</font>

566
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,850
using but you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> better than then</font>

567
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,168
that methodology and there are different

568
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:56,199
techniques are suggested for that and

569
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:58,990
the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using is called fixed</font>

570
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,240
point optimization also implemented and

571
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,980
some other people use more advanced

572
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,630
technique like techniques like the

573
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,390
Montgomery letter you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

574
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,610
in other working groups and finally

basically up front if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what so</font>

579
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:25,059
it depends on on the exchange work in

580
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:29,408
many cases can be done up front and the

581
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:34,000
window technique is it's also it's also

582
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:35,980
for efficient exponentiation but it's a

583
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,740
runtime technique it doesn't offer such

584

593
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,510
sort of the cipher suites that are

594
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,350
standardized that are also recommended

595
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,990
they are using diffie-hellman exchange

596
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:15,860
if emerald if you had an exchange easy

597
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:20,030
th e and and of course a signature the

598
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,770
signature mechanism ecds a and so if you

599
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:25,160
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the elliptic curve digital</font>

600
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:27,440

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,780
elliptic curve variant of the ESA or

602
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,520
sometimes quite ESS and you will find it

603
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:36,889
in this cipher suite that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the one</font>

605
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,530
be familiar to you because that's the

606
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:44,000
one recommended also in court in

607
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:48,230
consequently also named<font color="#CCCCCC"> aditya</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

608

609
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:54,679
came up just at the sea of achieve our

610
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,620
meeting if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use on the ECE as a</font>

611
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,150
signature mechanism it has some of the

612
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,189
pool of randomness property so it's

613
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:06,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the implementation uses in a</font>

614
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:10,360
randomized hashing technique which is

615
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:14,178
described in this RFC 69 79 which

616
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:17,419
prevents that you lead your private key

617
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:19,520
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use the same random random number</font>

618
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,770
of order for a construction sweet it's

619
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,240
just a way how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this digital signature</font>

620
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,760
algorithm works because it's based on

621
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,580
algemeine and it's just different than

622
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,919
what

623
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:33,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know from from the RSA keys in case</font>

624
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,630
you have no critic<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-op always</font>

625
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:37,919
recommends for the elliptic curve

626
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,919
variants of the public key variance to

627
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,110
use the diffie-hellman exchange along

628
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,700
with it and particularly the ephemeral

629
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,168
if you have an exchange and so I

630
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,470
included that as well because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

631
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:50,909
obviously contributes to the overall

performance and complex complexity of

633
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:57,720
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing okay and this is an</font>

expansion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the slide I've shown during</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the plenary on the key lens so needless</font>

636
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,799
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a trade-off between</font>

637
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,409
performance and security here and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

638
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,779
see you need to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right key size</font>

639
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:14,429
for the symmetric algorithms but as well

640
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:18,389
as for the ECCC or ECG as a and those

641
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:20,490
values sort of this the mapping from

642
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:22,490
symmetric key performance to this

643
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:27,389
asymmetric algorithms is basically

644
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:28,799
taking from alves<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC 4492 so you need</font>

645
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:33,510
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the right things are</font>

646
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things match match up um and so</font>

647
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,980
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the recommendation that</font>

648
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,539
the youth a document the TLS bcp

649
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,389
recommends then we are at the round 230

650
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:48,059
something it's for ECC depending on

651
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:49,320
which other recommendation you look it's

652
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:52,110
a little bit higher sometimes a little

653
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,570
bit lower just to give you a right rough

654
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:58,139
guess so that's what you see so I didn't

655
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:01,769
I didn't do performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests for four</font>

656
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:03,750
key lens which are far below what anyone

657
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,909
recommends of even though it would be

658
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,830
great from a from a performance point of

659
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:09,089
view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that they show</font>

660
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,489
you smart car performance with

661
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely ridiculous key sizes and you</font>

662
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:17,540
want to always works well but but the

663
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:22,800
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just complete crap um okay</font>

664
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:25,980
um so as a summary before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show you</font>

665
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,310
some of the numbers so are they are you

666
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,540
could just quickly add to that so when

667
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,090
we did the

668
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,659
recommendations for I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory</font>

669
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:41,210
to implement decision for<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-op we also</font>

670
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:43,379
looked at the expected life time of

671
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,179
Internet of Things devices and and

672
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,730
assume these have along your lifetime

673
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,030
then your garden-variety the IT system

674
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:55,469
so we went with a conservative side

675
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:57,380
there and yonder 256 plus yeah that's

676
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:00,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a good point and to note that</font>

677
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:04,170
obviously with the key size you need to

678
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:09,630
take the lifetime of the key into

679
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:11,850
account it so in for certain cases when

680
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:16,020
you really have when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a protocol</font>

681
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:18,509
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> ephemeral keys then it may be</font>

682
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,640
possible to actually use a shorter

683
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifetime if they use it more that almost</font>

684
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,740
as a session<font color="#E5E5E5"> key semantics which is not</font>

685
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,450
so much applicable to do it here let's

686
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,339
exchange but may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be applicable to some</font>

687
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,259
of the work that we currently do in a so

688
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:38,610
that's probably something to keep in

689
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:41,010
mind as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um it's good to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

690
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you betta first of the small question</font>

691
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">which this through the conclusions</font>

692
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:48,390
overall process right say that again is

693
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:54,390
these conclusions to overall processors

694
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:58,020
ah those here I for all of the pore size

695
00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I used an iron that's it yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep so the</font>

696
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:05,820
easy I'm so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> etes a signature is is</font>

697
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:09,540
much faster than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the than the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verify</font>

698
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,820
operation I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true even on</font>

699
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,570
in general just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the way how</font>

700
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,880
the signature operation works it I think

701
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:21,660
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way around in RSA if I'm</font>

702
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,220
not if I remember correctly so even so

703
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,319
you need to actually be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

704
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,390
compare because RSA can actually be

705
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,540
faster computationally if you just look

706
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right operations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course from a</font>

key sighs point of view what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

708
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,150
transmit over the wire easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> see will</font>

709
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,189
have an advantage as you have seen on a

710
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,410
previous slide if you go if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back</font>

711
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,760
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually why the</font>

712
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,129
recommendation is

713
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,080
to use ECC because of that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shorter</font>

714
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">keel and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the</font>

715
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:54,600
performance because if you compare let's

716
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:59,820
say 112 you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 230 3 bits keysight's</font>

717
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:03,600
for ECC but you need to use 2014 8 bits

718
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,670
of RSA keys for example that's what is

719
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,569
stable from this RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dimension</font>

720
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:11,130
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the brain food curves are much</font>

721

those they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> benefits because</font>

726
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,210
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why they are slower</font>

727
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:29,940
is because they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't use</font>

728
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,070
specially crafted our purchase and

729
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,770
primes but the instead generate them

730
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,810
randomly which of course then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

731
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:41,220
use a special structure because it's

732
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:44,130
randomly chosen um so that's that's a

733
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,770
downside but those are used for example

734
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">in smart grid deployments in Germany so</font>

735
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,450
those will have if you have a regulatory

736
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,240
mandate to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific that</font>

737
00:37:51,450 --> 00:38:00,060
specific curved and then you have to

738
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">live with it um um the performance for</font>

739
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,500
the based on the bit the bit lines of

740
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:09,959
the doctor curves it's obviously not

741
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,990
linear and so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go beyond 256</font>

742
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,490
because you have maybe a very long

lifetime of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your IT device you need to</font>

746
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:28,140
um there's only a minor difference but

747
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:31,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">since you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ETH but only the</font>

that they're nice curves has also the

759

766
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,540
here it takes into account timing such

an attack on all of the implement all of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code is constantly one forward</font>

00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,000
look into by timing such an attack that

in taking care

775
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,440
and as I was sure like symmetric key

776
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:07,280
cryptography is not a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight</font>

777
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:09,080
okay let me let me skip that slight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

778
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,710
put to them to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number so i started</font>

the m3 m4 which I have a better

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,650
performance I hope you can see that is

781
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:19,640
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to click on the on the webpage</font>

the maximum so what happens then is that

roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> or about the same the same</font>

processes

801

but passed upon it but it's an x3 um so

00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:36,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have roughly the numbers if you</font>

805
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,450
that's I would say pretty fast if you

00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:48,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">compare the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signature on to the</font>

previously seen your chest<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster and</font>

809
00:41:49,900 --> 00:42:00,099

<font color="#E5E5E5">this if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for the 199 be 192 you have</font>

812
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:10,450

814
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:16,000
differently so if you have the chance to

815
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,229
design your your overall system so

816
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,599
obviously you want to minimize the

817
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,049
verification operation on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the IOT</font>

819
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:27,490
operation if that's possible but it will

820
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:35,970
look later at what what that means for

821
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:38,200
TLS on and four for the be 256 curve and

822
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:41,109
we have previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for the</font>

823
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,210
signature of 122 milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we</font>

824
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:49,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">are talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 458 so one and 50</font>

825
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:52,599

826
00:42:49,960 --> 00:43:01,960
something the slide should say signature

827
00:42:52,599 --> 00:43:04,329
Paris all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's a copy this is</font>

828
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,460
yeah signature that's true that's true

829
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:10,349
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very fun copy paste</font>

830
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,320
should be a super strict I need to and

831
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:16,200
it's a big step<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you see you see</font>

832
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,640
I'm sort of the absolute values and sort

833
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what what you can expect and</font>

834
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:26,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously um of course if you look at if</font>

835
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:32,010
you crank up the key size then do 221

836
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,320
then we already in a like almost one and

837
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:43,310
a half seconds for the verification

838
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:47,490
operation which is quite a bit um and

839
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:48,900
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a brain focus on so this is</font>

840
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theatre operation the faster</font>

841
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:56,970
one if you compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is the 256</font>

842
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:59,070

843
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:03,689
that we have seen previously against the

00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:05,910
brain poker<font color="#CCCCCC"> proved 674 that and gives</font>

845
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,530
you an indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> that obviously it's</font>

846
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:12,598
all ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a signature operation is</font>

847
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:15,990
much much slower<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and in and for the</font>

848
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:20,910
verification operation more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

849
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:25,080
three seconds that's quite tell you

850
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:28,170
something in in for 200 512like more

851
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:32,700
than 10 seconds it's its massive so it's

852
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:34,859
for those type of processes are probably

853
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:42,480
unless you have a lot of time I'm not

854
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:44,310
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use working the puzzle so</font>

855
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,990
that the point where we actually ran

856
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,930
into problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GTA less and it's</font>

857
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,959
before time was and

858
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:52,879
so it simply doesn't work if three other

859
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,860
details implementation doesn't know that

860
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:02,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are very short yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better avoid</font>

861
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:04,520
that um duh so as I said the window

862
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,920

863
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,780
optimizations that helps to improve the

864
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,750
performance it's the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the</font>

865
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:15,290
least impact but already are here with

866
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:18,980
the signature operation it and I turned

867
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:22,240
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> or cranked frankly to the</font>

868
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:26,150
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the minimum window size then</font>

869
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,680
you see the difference is here from 66

870
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">are milliseconds to 127 so it's already</font>

871
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:40,940
has some some impact if you disable dose

872
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:42,859
for whatever reason um it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST</font>

873
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,590
performance optimization however eyes

874
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,450
that's a completely different story so

875
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:51,530
here are we compare so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

876
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:53,980
different processes now<font color="#E5E5E5"> also also from</font>

879
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,959
actually the easy eh this is the

880
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:05,150
diffie-hellman handshake now here on the

881
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,680
left hand side you see the optimization

882
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,470
this a verte on the right hand side you

883
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,810
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabled only the nist optimization</font>

884
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:16,339
and arid all the other optimization data

885
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:19,370
to disable and you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font>

886
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:23,660
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you pick the b1 i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d-do</font>

00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:36,549
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you disable so obviously and even in</font>

891
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,170
this knit using the special structure so

892
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:40,538
if you already used in this curve then

893
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> better use utilizes special</font>

894
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:45,849
structure of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> curve rather than then</font>

895
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,920
disabling that sort of optimization

896
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,809
which understand it but allow but the

897
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,190
performance impact would be will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

898
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:57,520
clearly visible and so those are now I'm

899
00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:00,369
for them for the login processes and

900
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,940
there the stories are more complicated

901
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">so here I disabled all the optimizations</font>

902
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,510
basically making it a slow as possible

903
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:09,910
and the diffie-hellman exchange

904
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:15,160
affirmative in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hammond exchange so ready</font>

918
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:17,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">see like here it gets a little tricky if</font>

919
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,069
you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

920
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,330
this is the signature verify operations

921
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:26,790
and also for the same process up like

922
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:31,290
signature operation more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than two</font>

seconds verified operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is 192</font>

924
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:40,529
curve verify up the operation more than

925
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:46,020
five seconds so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes a little bit of</font>

926
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:47,940
time yeah but if I am enable however all

927
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,450
the optimizations of course it gets

928
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:54,450
better um so here's the handshake

929
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:56,100
performance and or everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

930
00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:00,180
all optimizations so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

931
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:05,790
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the be 192 curve then we are</font>

932
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:07,740
about 800 milliseconds so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's much</font>

933
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:11,490
better it's it's much much still much

934
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:14,970
much lower than than m3 m4 that we've

935
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:19,649
looked into previously but gets into a

936
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:22,500
range<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is more acceptable and you</font>

937
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:27,780
can look at the detail values other

938
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">words if for the easy days so that the</font>

940
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:38,190
is roughly is similar to the performance

00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:41,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the verify operation the signature</font>

942
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:44,730
verification operation there of course

943
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:50,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sign operation is is much much</font>

944
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:54,330
better here for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinna 192 I'm 225</font>

945
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:57,810
milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's begin I'm pretty</font>

946
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:01,170
good with all performance enable and 845

947
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:03,990
for the for the corresponding verify

948
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,730
operation so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> four times four</font>

949
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:11,430
times the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the verify compared to</font>

950
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:14,160
the senior operation ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU are</font>

951
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:18,600
obviously has impact on so if you

952
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:20,940
compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster m3 with a slow</font>

953
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:26,240

954
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:29,490
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> two megahertz you you see</font>

955
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,500
you see some some impact so it's not

956
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:33,450
earth-shaking could be at least some of

957
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:37,080
the optimizations but the difference

958
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:39,750
here would be in so I used the P 192 as

959
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,970
you see the black box in the middle for

960
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:46,290
the diffie-hellman exchange we talked

961
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:55,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">about on 280 milliseconds versus 230</font>

962
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:58,380
milliseconds different on but not not

963
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,890
that yes so traumatic compared to the

964
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:05,580
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> other assholes okay do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

965
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:07,350
explanation for dead I mean one would

966
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:18,210
expected this case with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a factor of</font>

967
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:20,520
three autos algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> memory intensive</font>

968
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:25,020
you actually hit the memory bandwidth as

969
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:29,280
opposed to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> e processor I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

970
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:34,850
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> memory the memory data in a few</font>

971
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:38,610
slides so that means slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

972
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:42,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so here you see sort of a</font>

973
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:45,300
comparison among the different ports you

974
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:50,550
see most of them so those are in three

975
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:56,760
and then four so if you oh of course if

976
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:59,130
you increase the key lens then of course

977
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,120
it messes up there at the statistics but

978
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:06,150
if you just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first three</font>

979
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:08,940
bars for each for each processor then

980
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:11,820
it's it there is a difference but it's

981
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:17,200
not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so dramatic and all of them</font>

982
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:20,020
have a fairly good performance finger

983
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,149
it's good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this for for another of</font>

984
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:24,990
curves but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome of course the</font>

985
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:29,910
yellow was the one you on the rocket

986
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:34,990
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one on one we want um</font>

987
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:42,370
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we recommend</font>

988
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:46,000
yeah its military intervention yeah and

989
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:50,560
it like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the first one the</font>

990
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,780
third one is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7284</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mcgirt it's a</font>

991
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:57,360
it's a pretty reasonable performance

992
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,360
like under 200<font color="#E5E5E5"> milliseconds</font>

993
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimizations in neighborhood okay um</font>

994
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:11,200
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> curve are 25 519 I'm so look looked</font>

995
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:15,370
into that one as well and so here I on

996
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:20,339
the far left there's this cortex m0 with

997
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:23,410
48 megahertz are called KL 46 set and

998
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:26,230
there are three different performance or

999
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:28,359
three different or data collected for

1000
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:31,420
three different implementations the

1001
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:34,600
first column the biggest one is our

1002
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:37,950
implementation not optimized for the

1003
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:44,220
elliptic curve diffie-hellman and it was

1004
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:48,430
roughly one and a half seconds for the

1005
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:50,020
photo curve for that then Bernstein if

1006
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:52,210
you however compared sort of the

1007
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,370
optimized version from google which we

1008
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,920
also ran on<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those processes but</font>

1009
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:58,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't optimized for ARM processors we</font>

1010
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,100
just basically took the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1011
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:02,140
optimized for a desktop and server

1012
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:07,750
environment and dumped it on the on the

1013
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:09,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">arm platform it's that has 550</font>

1014
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,650
milliseconds so it's obviously a

1015
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,390
completely different scale and to have

1016
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:17,170
the comparison with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had shown</font>

1017
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:20,200
previously and to compare this with Miss

1018
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:23,609
be 256 version that I

1019
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:27,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had shown a few slides ago that has</font>

1020
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:31,270
1145 milliseconds so if you compare that

1021
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">so at the moment sort of the curve on 25</font>

1022
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">519 implementation we have is actually</font>

1023
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,270
slower than than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nispom</font>

1024
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:40,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">demonstration but the reason for that is</font>

1025
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:43,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it hasn't the coat doesn't take</font>

1026
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,950
the big number implementation doesn't

1027
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,359
take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the special structure</font>

1028
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:48,578
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> curve and that makes all these</font>

1029
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:49,900
curves different so that obviously

1030
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:53,020
doesn't help you if you have an

1031
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:55,900
unorganized version then these new

1032
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,910
curves don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you anywhere however if</font>

1033
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,770
you optimize it even not if you don't

1034
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:01,328
optimize it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that target platform for</font>

1035
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,640
the right target platform that already

1036
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:07,920
makes a huge difference and so it's

1037
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:12,009
twice as fast which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is good and</font>

1038
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:16,060

good<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm 23 minutes left pocket so end</font>

1045
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:37,390
but it's also nice about about that new

1046
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,210
curve that is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered is it has</font>

1047
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:48,160
a very low ram footprint that's pretty

<font color="#CCCCCC">good the should 255 19 numbers are</font>

1049
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,109
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why why we are</font>

1050
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:56,829
opposed to have a PS k<font color="#CCCCCC"> + forward</font>

1051
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:58,900
security about so the document i don't

1052
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:00,550
know if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually expired or not but</font>

1053
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,890
we will revive it because it's really

1054
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a PS k</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> + forward security</font>

1055
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:07,328
firm for those applications litigation

1056
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,730
is the psk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you general once it's</font>

1057
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:11,819
standardized it will definitely be very

1058
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:16,000
useful so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the deployment</font>

1059
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:19,089
version because the work on the ellip

1060
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,540
down the signature version is still

1061
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:24,940
ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the progress is a little bit</font>

1062
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:28,060
different there is however if you go

1063
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,800
into assembly optimizations there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1064
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,069
other library that I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

1065
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,940
micro ECC library

1066
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:39,680
and that has also the code for for the

1067
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:42,170
nice curves and you can see it's unlike

1068
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:46,698
the code the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl ssl code has no</font>

1069
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:48,410
assembly arm assembly optimizations in

1070
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:51,229
there and it turns out that you can

1071
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,940
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you by hand craft the code</font>

1072
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:54,890
normally which think the compiler is

1073
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,539
much better at producing optimized code

1074
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:58,940
but in fact in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific case it</font>

1075
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:03,019
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so if you look at the numbers</font>

1076
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:07,699
there's a huge difference between sort

1077
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:10,129
of the runtime<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the numbers that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1078
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:13,569
showed and what my crazy seat provides

1079
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:15,559
as the fact that two or three with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1080
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:17,749
optimizations understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1081
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:20,269
optimization so they're still even if

1082
00:57:17,749 --> 00:57:22,279
you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the ordinariness curse and</font>

1083
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:24,468
then do the assembly instruction

1084
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:26,449
optimization you will still get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1085
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:28,880
factor of two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and if you then</font>

1086
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:30,499
switch to denver's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got curve and</font>

1087
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,469
then optimize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> third I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

1088
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:35,868
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really Turner I was</font>

1089
00:57:33,469 --> 00:57:38,569
curious what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the compiler used for this</font>

1090
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:40,160
they'll generate the code thing what

1091
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:47,269
compiler did you use to generate the

1092
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:50,269
code what some see on<font color="#E5E5E5"> CC six with me</font>

1093
00:57:47,269 --> 00:57:53,868
yeah so the compiler that arm for vonage

1094
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:55,848
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right thing so it's just about</font>

1095
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:58,670
all the time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run quickly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm</font>

1096
00:57:55,849 --> 00:58:00,709
cancer I quickly so we also looked at

1097
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:02,690
the memory consumption um we only

1098
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:08,569
measure the heat and not the stack but

1099
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:11,180
the heap is is what it memory comes in

1100
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:12,410
our the heap is where we have most of

1101
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">the memory consumption rather than the</font>

1102
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:17,719
stack because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way how the program</font>

1103
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:19,369
is written so the floating-point the

1104
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:23,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixed point optimization consumes a</font>

1105
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:25,160
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM here is the the fixed</font>

1106
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:27,699
point optimization is this a bird but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1107
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:31,089
you can see these elliptic curves are

1108
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:32,829
complications they require ram at least

1109
00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:34,569
certainly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the info</font>

1110
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:36,579
that we have and so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on of</font>

1111
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:40,109
course they depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the size of</font>

1112
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the curve but we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about for</font>

1113
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:48,609
256 for the 256 curve on to kill applies

1114
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:51,489
for additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM that you need when</font>

1115
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you run those algorithms go to the next</font>

1116
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:58,930
slide if you any cable on the

1117
00:58:54,069 --> 00:59:01,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">floating-point optimization then it's it</font>

1118
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:06,640
obviously increases because you the

1119
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:09,009
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that you cashpoints and so</font>

1120
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:13,029
we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 256 we're</font>

1121
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:15,519
doubling the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM usage in for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher for</font>

1122
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:19,209
close with a high and before long bit

1123
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:31,209
lines you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like it gets in over 14</font>

1124
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:35,440
kilobytes for the 521 bit um so the

1125
00:59:31,209 --> 00:59:38,078
summer here is if you if you want the

1126
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,380
optimizations there's a trade-off with

1127
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:44,349
the RAM usage so you obviously be a

1128
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,719
price here but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the benefit</font>

1129
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:50,979
of enabling those optimizations are pay

1130
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:53,739
off because you obviously get so here

1131
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:57,968
this figure shows on the heap usage in

1132
00:59:53,739 --> 01:00:01,479
invites compared to enabling the

1133
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:02,979
optimizations and disabling so there's

1134
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:05,979
obviously some difference but on the

1135
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:10,328
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit</font>

1136
01:00:05,979 --> 01:00:12,578
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gain is basically you and the</font>

1137
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:15,009
summary is if you increase fifty percent

1138
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:16,449
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RAM usage you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get an</font>

1139
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:20,289
increased performance by a factor of

1140
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:24,910
eight or more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say go for them</font>

1141
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:27,130
go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the performance in this case and</font>

1142
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:28,740
then i'm applying there besides you so

1143
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:30,090
this is this those are

1144
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,009
operations but of course when you look

<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and so you need to add up the</font>

1164
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:30,350
need to add a few additional arms

1166
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:35,220
use the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the public key</font>

the Rope<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the key mode but but it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate mode in the specification</font>

1171
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,549
needless to say at one quick word about

1172
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,770
symmetric key cryptography because I

1173
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:51,480
said it's super fast um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've skipped</font>

1174
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:55,109
skip that slide it's just an

1175
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,050
introductory of what what that means so

1176
01:01:55,109 --> 01:02:00,710
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at here I'm i have this m0</font>

1177
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:03,720
sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really slow processor and</font>

1178
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:07,790
again milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

1181
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:26,570
you two point two milliseconds it let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1182
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:28,700
go back just like once that punch

1187
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:43,759
milliseconds so obviously like symmetric

1188
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,040
cryptography you don't need the hardware

1189
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,320
acceleration no problem how do i

1190
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,390
acceleration me or the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> ES and</font>

1191
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,070
hardware may provide you other benefits

01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:55,940
in terms of sight Chandler assistance

1193
01:02:52,070 --> 01:03:01,010
but from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for- point of view not an</font>

1194
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:06,850
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> x1 faster processor obviously like</font>

01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:10,010
the m3 a SCCM 1 2 128 one point seven

1196
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:12,920
milliseconds obvious are not something

1197
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:16,580
to worry about and my conclusions like

1198
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:19,220
um so needless to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ECC</font>

1199
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:21,650
crypto needs some time and we have

1200
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">chosen intention at you also include</font>

1201
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:25,660
that as those that recommended cipher

1202
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Suites and had chosen a one that has a</font>

1203
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:32,930
diff you have an exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee as well in</font>

1204
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:34,880
femoral so what the exact value is that

1205
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:38,930
one needs to worry about the bench

1206
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,360
really on the actual application because

1207
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:43,730
the good thing about dls is it does the

1208
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,130
heavy lifting at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning and then</font>

1209
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:47,930
is established as the session Keys and

1210
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:50,060
we may at some time in the future may

1211
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:52,609
need to refresh keys but then in the

1212
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,740
meanwhile in a time in between you run

1213
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:59,570
you work with the symmetric keys which

1214
01:03:54,740 --> 01:04:02,000
are obviously super fast um so um what

1215
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,050
the exact performances depends on as

1216
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,620
you've seen on a number of different

1217
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:11,110
factors and so it's not a simple answer

1218
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:13,430
but someone who works on a specific

1219
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:15,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">application has to then think about like</font>

1220
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:17,120
what's the acceptable delay for the user

1221
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:19,640
when is set it up like is this is this

1222
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup that we do when the user</font>

1223
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,600
unpacks the device and pushes the button

1224
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:27,680
and it talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some server where maybe</font>

1225
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:29,650
a longer interaction delay may be

1226
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,058
acceptable or<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

1227
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:34,630
something where it's a real time

1228
01:04:31,059 --> 01:04:39,760
interaction needed like or whatever um

1229
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:47,020
and then obviously like half a second

1230
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:49,150
counts<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in terms of next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step so</font>

1231
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:51,880
we obviously I've seen it in in one of

1232
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:53,380
the introductory slides that I there's

1233
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,970
some other data that i would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1234
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,500
collect particularly on energy

1235
01:04:54,970 --> 01:05:00,759
efficiency which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't done yet and</font>

1236
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:03,339
verify some of the other data and do

1237
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:06,430
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new curves that the CF</font>

1238
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:07,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">Archie is looking into so I'm doing all</font>

1239
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:09,339
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff is quite time-consuming as</font>

1240
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:11,170
you as you can imagine it because I

1241
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically needs to compile the code</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thermal image run the whole</font>

1243
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,740
thing in and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the</font>

1244
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:21,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">test for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a longer period of time so and</font>

1245
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:24,459
I need to manually do that and and that

1246
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:26,890
takes time so if someone is interested

1247
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:31,839
to also look into that that will be

1248
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:33,129
great and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like at the end I</font>

1249
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:36,308
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to put some of the</font>

1250
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:38,529
conclusions of this into the LP VLS

1251
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:40,210
minimum document with reference to what

1252
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:43,900
we did in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the profile document</font>

1253
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:46,000
give developers in product design as

1254
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:48,940
some additional ideas what they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1255
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,859
of some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organizations okay thanks</font>

1256
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,329
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say we all ten minutes</font>

1257
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:53,650
over but I wanted to get through this

1258
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:56,049
because it's very interesting so I go

1259
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:57,579
for it Robbie Robbie Simpson a quick

1260
01:05:56,049 --> 01:06:00,279
question I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised to see that the</font>

1261
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:03,099
performance for GCM was better than CCM

1262
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:04,720
and I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that most of the</font>

1263
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:06,880
lightweight world<font color="#CCCCCC"> has centered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1264
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:10,299
CCM is simply because it's a nard we're

1265
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:13,599
so often did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get any numbers on RAM</font>

1266
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:17,890
or code usage if you don't use hardware

1267
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:19,750
acceleration for GCM vs DCM I didn't I

1268
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,400
didn't look into that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I the</font>

1269
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:24,299
focus was more than heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

1270
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,299
asymmetric crypto

1271
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:32,000
I haven't also looked at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

1272
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:33,439
cha-cha and these type of algorithms

1273
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,840
that other people propose they claim

1274
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's much much better I'm probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font>

1275
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:43,340
way to do it as well my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking there</font>

1276
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:44,900
is that GCM is the MTI suite for a lot

1277
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,400
of other protocols so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1278
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:52,130
interesting to do the comparison yeah

1279
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:53,660
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice anyway okay thanks a</font>

1280
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:56,150
lot so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said we are actually 10</font>

1281
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:59,509
minutes over so we'll probably have to

1282
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:01,730
cut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off there but thanks for your</font>

1283
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:03,310
tenants so if you if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font>

1284
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:07,190
