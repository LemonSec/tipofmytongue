to disclose the fact that fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,850
today does anybody have any additions or

31
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,850
subtractions

32
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,018
alright so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the status of</font>

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,140
where we're at so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had two new</font>

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:22,799
working group documents admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag</font>

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,048
actually managed to rev once since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:33,269
Honolulu a lot of these everyone should

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">be familiar with we the ones in bold on</font>

39
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:41,040
these slides are being presented today

40
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:43,500
any comments on those we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a little</font>

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,319
bit the lacs on our key metric

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,370
extensions so that's completed last call

43
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,280
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to push it through and</font>

44
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,379
extended sequence number is should be

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:02,549
completing last IETF last call soon I

46
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:04,638
think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some new IDs so look for</font>

47
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:08,000
these on the you know list and maybe

48
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,000
give some guidance

49
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:21,319
all of the updated IDs are being

50
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:23,390
presented today and then we have some

51
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,790
existing stuff some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sort of</font>

52
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,738
just you know waiting to time out like

53
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,319
the critical sub tlv and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it since</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the distribution trees will</font>

55
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,920
push that over to multicast the source

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,410

related to home nap right now they're

58
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:50,530
not restricted to home that's used but

if you go to data tracker<font color="#CCCCCC"> anti-bias ISS</font>

63
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:11,510

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,988

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so i'm stefan from orange i will</font>

71
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,210
present you the updates regarding the is

79
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:40,920
are also modifying the authentication so

80
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:43,859
based on vicki chain model from AC we

81
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,500
are introducing so the ability to use a

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">keychain reference so toward via</font>

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,430
keychain model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in Norder to</font>

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,580
simplify via oughtn't equation between

85
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,800
all the routing protocols we are

86
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,150
currently using some groupings coming

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,490
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> vikki chain to not redefining all</font>

88
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,969
the autentica possible I authentication

89
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:14,310
algorithm so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's inherited from</font>

90
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">keychain and as AC already mentioned</font>

91
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,250
during the LT gwg if an implementation

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,680
is not supporting for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> che one</font>

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,480
for specific routing protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,640
expected that the back end will reject

95
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,070
the configuration next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide we are also</font>

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,890
introducing first reward I PFS

97
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:39,090
throughout configuration there was a lot

98
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:42,180
of debate on it so what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing</font>

99
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:46,289
years so it's a support of LFA on the

100
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,170
matter if a remoter if a is seen as a

101
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,570
child of LFA so if you want to activate

102
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> motel fail you will have to activate</font>

103
00:06:51,570 --> 00:07:00,180
RFA first and the activation is only

104
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:03,020
done / interface so next slide so you

105
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,440
will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this is a global</font>

106
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,200
configuration so what we done globally

107
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,710
is just creating containers but these

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,560
containers are empty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just where for</font>

109
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,549
augment

110
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,460
so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

111
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:26,889
vendor agreement this container using

112
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:28,900
for example LFA policies so the global

113
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,139
configuration is really not to activate

114
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">LFA so next slide so next slide is the</font>

115
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,680
interface configuration for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast</font>

116
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout and you have the ability</font>

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,700
through via enabled key word and the

118
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,000
first word LFA to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

119
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:52,870
activate LFA or remotely facing under

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:57,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">via the interface next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide there was</font>

121
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,770
also some adding regarding spring we are

122
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,100
currently under<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion about what</font>

123
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:08,200
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept in this is is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yang model</font>

124
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:11,350
and what should be in the spring segment

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,599
routing yang model so currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

126
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:16,479
situation is not clear so there are some

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,510
redundant information between both model

128
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:25,090
but we hope to clarify this quite quite

129
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:27,460
soon there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was still the discussion</font>

130
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,229
between the vrf centric and protocol

131
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,460
sandwich which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the description of</font>

132
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,559
the week and to the statues now it seems

133
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,380
that very clear consensus to go to add

134
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,780
to the grf so routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance centric</font>

135
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,088
model so where was a discussion on net

136
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,010
word where was a discussion on etsy gwg

137
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds that the consensus is well so</font>

138
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:52,510
we will update via model accordingly

139
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:54,850
next time so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step internal</font>

140
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,610
configuration we pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

141
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,830
are done but we are clearly welcoming

142
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,670
comments if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some critical</font>

143
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:07,380
pieces that we missed we are starting

144
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:11,140
the review of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operational state so</font>

145
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are currently trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to align both</font>

146
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,330
configuration trees and operational

147
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">states trees which was not the case</font>

this to type of trees the blue one is

171
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:55,630
the shortest path and for exceptions

traffic steering in some cases we may

173
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:02,740
need extra seat trees this is for small

174

networks and for rare usage one

175
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,600
important thing is that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

which was for bringing it sink the idea

228
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,689
I've got comments from a number of

<font color="#CCCCCC">people which are included</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

231
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:37,690
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring the draft for this</font>

232
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,689
meeting as in as good shape as possible

233
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,790
there are updates for clarifications

234
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,940
like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we achieve the symmetric</font>

235
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,180
parts this was not made clear in the

236
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,640
former versions that in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:05,120
maximum one and we use the tiebreaking

240
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:07,420
used by SPB for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cloaca spot and there</font>

241
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,190
were also further updates on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amati</font>

242
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,660
aspects for the clarification and there

243
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:18,110
is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> new thing the previous documents</font>

244
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:20,449
only described the case of an so one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the mechanisms is when the topology sub</font>

249
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,720
it consists of a single block but for

250
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,120
instance if the physical topology has

251

252
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,890
blocks and this new revision of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">draft covers the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-block case as</font>

254
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:50,150
well next<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a summary</font>

the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> funds and summary on the on the</font>

259
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,980
new tier is being specified by this

260
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:09,170
draft and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide is the last one</font>

261
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:12,050
just a quick summary I I pretty much

262
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,689
said what in the top in the slide that

263
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,650
this is extension to SP be reusing

264
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:22,310
theories without put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> code change and</font>

265
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:24,680
the bottom is is quite important qca is

266
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,189
under final review and we would like to

267
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:31,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">move forward with this is spc our draft</font>

268
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:34,310
here it would be good to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working</font>

269
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:38,620
group adoption and really allocation for

270
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,619
the code points of the sub theories

271
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um so he would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bit the road</font>

272
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">map on progress in this further so this</font>

273
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:55,619
is not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a classical IDF document</font>

274
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:59,130
so i would like to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

275
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:02,640
group adoption call right after this

276
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:06,740
meeting will give it some period the

277
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:11,339
usual two weeks and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like</font>

278
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:14,609
janish and friends to initiate the

earlier location procedure such they get

00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:20,479
their code points which are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

throughout a proc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Oklahoma we</font>

283
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:38,280
progress the document further and well

284
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:41,790
send it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> IHG for publication so if you</font>

have any concerns about the way

286
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:50,210
progressing things that way please speak

287
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,210
up on the list of course as well

288

which one which one do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

291
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,950
first

292
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">here dear auto be of our ID or beer</font>

293
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,970
Oh

296
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,420
morning everyone I'm 20p are two

297
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:39,200
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> first who read the update on</font>

298
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:44,030
the beer<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes is the 02 that was</font>

299
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,700
published in meantime<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay huge response</font>

300
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:53,389
who r<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the auto allocation procedure</font>

301
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:56,680
oh and ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay ah next one please so</font>

302
00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:01,180
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what happened between</font>

303
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,990
2001 and 02 to support beer via is is so

304
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,260
basically was all aligned with

305
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,910
architecture worked at ice and a couple

306
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,110
of other people arrogant needed so

307
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,780
subdomains have been introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

308
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,639
biggest one<font color="#CCCCCC"> subdomains our map to</font>

309
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,129
topology and other authors must agree on

310
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,650
the mapping so the supplement belongs to

311
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,600
topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> subdomain has a single</font>

312
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,340
encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm still poking</font>

313
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,209
d'architecture people to spell it out

314
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,740
specifically on because theoretically we

315
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:34,880
could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> in capsulation translation on</font>

316
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,340
beer within a subdomain r sub domain has

317
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,450
a single tree or forwarding strategy so

318
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,740
that is implicit in the architecture on

319
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,970
but I'm being poked and poked by more

320
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,160
and more people whether we could run

321
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,770
anything else but SPF so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

322
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep the draft open enough so it's not</font>

323
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:57,290
excluded and what was LEDs that any

324
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,090
rotten all advertising enough labels for

325
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,590
all the BF ers will be ignored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

326
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,290
computation that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i basically</font>

327
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,090
wait for implementation and deployment

328
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,470
experience whether people want that or

329
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:12,290
not good so basically the new stuff is

330
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,850
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tv's has been reordered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

331
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">market topology when I have to sub</font>

332
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,840
domain and within that we have the

333
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,979
encapsulation enough labels and we have

334
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,889
an optional sub tlv to indicate the tree

335
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,380
type and when it's omitted it means SPF

336
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,850
implicitly today so it's spelled out but

337
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,040
it can show up later and the routers

338
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,360
that run SPF today and see a tlv they

339
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,490
don't understand for the tree will know

340
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,780
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot participate next one</font>

341
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:41,360
please um<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

342
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:47,750
introduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which is</font>

343
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:49,669
an experimental idea um so one of the

344
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,950
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have some discussions with</font>

345
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:56,330
people about is that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get enough</font>

346
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,710
deployment in terms of size and we need

347
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:04,520
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of PVR bits whether an automatic</font>

348
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:06,980
assignment makes sense and we were not

349
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that until these but the idea</font>

350
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,720
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that we can put on a tlv a</font>

351
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:14,120
minimum maximum version number of what

352
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,880
protocol version<font color="#E5E5E5"> de still V represents</font>

353
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,889
and with that without introducing a

354
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,929
completely new TLD we can progress the

355
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:24,830
tlv and indicate two previous routers

356
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:28,610
and very precisely in which rate range

357
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:31,790
they have to work version wise to to be

358
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:34,490
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interpret this tlv the biggest</font>

359
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,350
advantage is that routers to run a newer

360
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,150
version could rather steal via the newer

361
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,949
version indicating a newer version with

362
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,980
new information which all routers do not

363
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,530
understand and fall back once they have

364
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,080
enough information publish it at the

365
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:53,980
lower version of the tlv allowing old

366
00:22:48,080 --> 00:23:01,299
all the routers to participate um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

367
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:04,580
next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so the first one is the</font>

368
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:06,110
sub tlv<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer sub tlv so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tagged</font>

369
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,970
length now the version with a

370
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,159
compatibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit then maybe mean max</font>

371
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,100
version no I need discussion on the

372
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:17,059
stuff sub domain ID is under it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

373
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:20,209
bfr ID which can be empty under that we

374
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:23,178
have the encapsulation that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPLS</font>

375
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,190
encapsulation which has a label range

376
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,299
size what is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit mask length because</font>

377
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,799
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change in the</font>

378
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,450
sense the sub domain can support

379
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,770
multiple business line so it's a list

380
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:38,960
and the very right squeeze in is what

381
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:41,660
tree type on this sub domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> supports</font>

382
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,120
when it's missing it means SPF but in

383
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,270
the future when this tlv well-known sub

384
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,860
sub sub tlv will show up routers will

385
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,800
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they cannot participate</font>

386
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,479
because it is not SPF so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people start</font>

387
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,100
to build Steiner I also basically

388
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,870
indicated that there

389
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,370
put enough opaque data to actually all

390
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,949
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steiner</font>

391
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:04,340
they're running so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

392
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,200
the update<font color="#E5E5E5"> um let's let me take the</font>

393
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,600
questions now towards that if there are

394
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,070
any and then I quickly basically just

395
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,570
run through the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the auto</font>

396
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,918
election because if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who didn't</font>

397
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,309
read the draft it's pointless to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie</font>

398
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">going into more depth questions</font>

399
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:35,540
AC<font color="#CCCCCC"> lindam a cisco other the only thing</font>

400
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm wondering about is the terminology</font>

401
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:42,379
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eggman routing draft uses</font>

402
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:45,620
algorithm and this uses treat Type O I

403
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,180
was the world ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for four somewhat</font>

404
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,399
the same thing it may look maybe they

405
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,650
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aligned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah point taken</font>

406
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:59,300
i will align this stuff all right i mean

407
00:24:51,650 --> 00:25:03,110
there's no particular preference and

408
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:07,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's great let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jennifer i was actually</font>

409
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:10,189
first time that I saw using versioning

410
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:14,510
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> subkey Elvis I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under the</font>

411
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:17,660
impression that the versioning tool is

412
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:22,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tlv your security code point</font>

413
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:24,800
yes any any reasoning why you ended up

414
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,570
to that solution yes imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want</font>

415
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,330
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement the absolute</font>

416
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,639
minimum set and then I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

417
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,830
which does a smart election after the

418
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,190
election ran I can show people the old

419
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,230
style tlv while the election is running

420
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other routers back</font>

421
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,280
off it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> format you</font>

422
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,899
understand but I have sub T all these

00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,540
inside if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand them you</font>

424
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,270
screw up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use exactly the same</font>

425
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,010
format but I bump up the version 201 I

426
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">say you don't speak 01 don't look at the</font>

427
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,700
TLB the moment the election ran and I

428
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,419
have all the information that makes

429
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,550
sense in 00 I just drop the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

430
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the TLD 200 and all the old style</font>

431
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,980
routers participate happily so that

432
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:11,750
allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note every time you put a sub</font>

434
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,530
people screw up I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new TLD</font>

435
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:21,560
type as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see you right you're using it</font>

436
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:24,290
for atomic nessa cement yeah okay yes so

437
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,690
you know it's an experimental idea but

438
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,960
since we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this Auto election and I</font>

439
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,100
don't want to force people today to

440
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,830
understand implement do anything about

441
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,800
it I want the future hook<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people</font>

442
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,960
operating on the same key of<font color="#E5E5E5"> E format</font>

443
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,750
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate it after the</font>

444
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,010
smarter guys figured out their stuff i

445
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,780
mean it is

446
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,030
it's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same ideas shared</font>

447
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,560
libraries of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lineups right you load the</font>

448
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,570
library and you tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i'm at three</font>

449
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,350
but I can really also<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to to you but</font>

450
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:56,750
please I cannot talk what so I mean that

451
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,879
my first thought was wouldn't you just

452
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,350
use to TL VZ and then back up to the old

453
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">man after that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other possibility</font>

454
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,840
yes so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the</font>

455
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,000
same format but you change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

456
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,010
and you talk to steal these and then you

457
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,050
publish and worst case you end up with

458
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,970
two versions right like all the version

459
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,570
with all the routers new version for the

460
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,460
newer routers yes so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

461
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,139
simple naive way to do it right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

462
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:27,170
more implementation more<font color="#CCCCCC"> TL these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

463
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:28,940
data published so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Chris so it seems</font>

464
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,510
like an interesting idea as making an

465
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,760
experimental seems reasonable but at

466
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:37,220
actually sort of sharing the the data

467
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,170
that you to my concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

468
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,690
you actually sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of brought in the</font>

469
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:46,100
testing space of for compatibility

470
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:48,170
testing that you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually you know</font>

471
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,540
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you don't have versioning</font>

472
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,790
often a lot of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> are discovered</font>

473
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,590
during interrupt testing even with

474
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,810
things that are supposedly the identical

475
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:00,740
version and now you've basically created

476
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:04,340
a matrix of of cases you know version 3

477
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,800
& 4 & 4 & 5 that need to work together

478
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right the argument I</font>

479
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,950
would make it is absolutely equivalent

480
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:15,440
to having to tlv types the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLD time 135</font>

481
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,760
will indicate version 11 3620<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kate</font>

482
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,680
version 2 I it's not it's not quite that

483
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,170
vary because you because you're sort of

484
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,330
taking over and putting a value and it

485
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,550
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different time yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

486
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,169
if you go wild and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 124 and you</font>

487
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,510
want to do all the permutations yeah

488
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:36,350
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only gave two bits to a</font>

489
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:38,750
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it one but but then we</font>

490
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice one that's about it sorry</font>

491
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:46,640
we're out of runs runway les mots

492
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,139
Ginsberg who are you you owe me<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it</font>

493
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:54,380
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's a really nice guy thank you</font>

494
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,150
so two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is something that</font>

495
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,370
you know we we are still kind of

496
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:02,990
actively discussion discussing even

497
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:06,110
among the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-authors you're</font>

498
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:10,400
essentially making the version number a

499
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:12,469
new type that has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> controlled that</font>

500
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,260
was where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm immigration yes</font>

501
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:18,410
allegation electrical noise the other

502
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:22,790
thing that concerns me is how you define

503
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:24,680
the transition strategies as old or new

504
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,230
routers appear and disappear in the

505
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,180
network and you're able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move forward</font>

506
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">or backwards on your version numbers I</font>

507
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:34,280
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always problematic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

508
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,020
fair observation and if we're going to

509
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this I think we need to do a better</font>

510
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,350
job of specifying how that happens yeah

511
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,490
fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreed so I mean this is something</font>

512
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,560
yes it's a completely new idea i'm

513
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,770
throwing it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wall i won't actually</font>

514
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,600
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know beat me up and see</font>

515
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,310
how bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets right and also the idea</font>

516
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,419
i socialized they<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe they for they</font>

517
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,129
find the beat still liking the bitch

518
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,080
that don't like and we basically have

519
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,610
the trade-offs and otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

520
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,129
there's always the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fallback like okay</font>

521
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's get the new tlv time number okay</font>

522
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,450
so yeah the discussion you know I want

523
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pick up the discussion right and I</font>

524
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,420
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show a feature that will benefit</font>

525
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,100
from it so people understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

526
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,020
opens possibility to do those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on</font>

527
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,719
the protocol we couldn't do currently

528
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">right today we just basically say well</font>

529
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,500
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up till these you don't</font>

530
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,330
understand them just keep on going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

531
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,830
if someone introduced<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that</font>

532
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,080
breaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> things he better explains very</font>

533
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,179
well and then ultimately somehow at

534
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:35,360
certain pony time cuts over to a new tlv

535
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:37,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">tied</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough okay so then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

536
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,199
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> next presentation I I very</font>

537
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,149
coarsely explained the idea of this

538
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">author election how although that would</font>

539
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,930
run with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

540
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,409
so where is not that familiar with beer

541
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:01,320
the very short summary the route the

542
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:03,419
receiving routers need a bit allocated

543
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,799
in a bit mask and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea currently is</font>

544
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,659
that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the deployments are</font>

545
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,570
small enough and stable enough it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

546
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:11,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a manual configuration if there's a</font>

547
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,320
collision there's notification people

548
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:17,460
take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it or may a central</font>

549
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,490
controller this proposes something akin

550
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,619
to a designated router right so people

551
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,409
have a central authority they can get

552
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:29,158
beats from or it's more maybe a better

553
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">analogy is a dhcp server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right next</font>

554
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:36,749
one please ah so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have some</font>

555
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,240
domain at apologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

556
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:41,249
number of those be<font color="#CCCCCC"> f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ers can go pretty</font>

557
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,600
big because we have two sets so

558
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:45,990
basically we are not constrained<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

559
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,769
bit mask length up to a reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> size</font>

560
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:52,129
we may be talking you know low number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

561
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:55,830
thousands for sure of receiver<font color="#CCCCCC"> beads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

562
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:57,449
so you manual configuration certain

563
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,090
point in time if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

564
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,039
successful will become invisible right

565
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,899
otherwise we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> all still assigning</font>

566
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,919
IP addresses by hand to I worked like a

567
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:09,658
charm or ftp<font color="#CCCCCC"> et Cie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host and so it that</font>

568
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,460
it always ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a centralized and</font>

569
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,809
distributed solution the centralized

570
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,200
solution is probably something akin to

571
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,730
SDN controller right which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font>

572
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,379
single point of failure if you replicate

573
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,929
them you have split brain scenario sets

574
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:24,209
its own limitations and a distribute

575
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:26,279
solution is far more resilient I mean

576
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,470
that's why we were here right<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

577
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,679
protocols like this of course always

578
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:36,929
additional complexity next one please

579
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so the whole thing is the main</font>

580
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:42,240
thing it is completely backwards

581
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,699
compatible to the drafts that to support

582
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,440
beer / is is so people can do they

583
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,200
implement what what the draft eyes eyes

584
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,879
beer says and when this thing is slipped

585
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,440
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that won't realize the</font>

586
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,969
change there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all-star routers</font>

587
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,220
not supporting anything new and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

588
00:32:53,970 --> 00:33:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participating just fine and their</font>

589
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,879
assignments will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fully honored okay</font>

590
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,700
the trick behind the whole thing is

591
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:06,600
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much that there is purse up to</font>

592
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,390
Maine whatever night

593
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">we spread out a designated route Rebecca</font>

594
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,200
designated routers lots of that stuff is

595
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,660
stolen from<font color="#E5E5E5"> John because it's so stable</font>

596
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,970
and this thing will act as central

597
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,000
authority so the routers can signal on

598
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,400
the tlv saying give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an assignment and</font>

599
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,080
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one I would prefer and what</font>

600
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,780
they get back from the designated router

601
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,428
will be basically bit assignment for it

602
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:34,049
or an error or whatever all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

603
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:36,090
conditions excellent please um I won't

604
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:42,480
even go how many sub T of Easter things

605
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:44,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">and titles but the dr basically puts out</font>

606
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,710
something which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assignments in it</font>

607
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:51,809
and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal info tlv people set a</font>

608
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,390
bit to signal give me an assignment and

609
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:57,210
or they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have an administrative</font>

610
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,340
asst assignment the<font color="#E5E5E5"> version number as</font>

611
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,870
long as the assignment is going on the

612
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,520
router will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm at version number</font>

613
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,408
one if you don't understand version

614
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,139
number one please don't look look at my

615
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,940
advertisement the moment d assignment is

616
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,200
stable they put the assignment into the

617
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,700
four minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm with versions year</font>

618
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,460
which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> all routers can perfectly</font>

619
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,460
well work with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this last one</font>

620
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">next one please I think it's it yet</font>

621
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,100
alright so that's coarsely the idea if

622
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:25,609
there are any comments don't towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

623
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,609
you have one more

624
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:38,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">ac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lindam Cisco ah the only thing I'm</font>

625
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,089
thinking is if you're setting up

626
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:43,538
subdomains you're going to have to

627
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:46,799
decide what routers participate in every

628
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:50,289
sub domain and when you're doing that

629
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:51,969
when you're doing that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as</font>

630
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:54,190
well give it an ID because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

631
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,719
I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only half of the setting</font>

632
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,599
up a sub domain in anything unless

633
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,098
subdomains unless you envision a

634
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:04,450
deployment scenario where subdomains

635
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:06,220
come and go dynamically it will depend

636
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,769
how people deploy services of a sub

637
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,988
domains but basically what this thing

638
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:13,029
takes is one configuration step out so

639
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:16,900
you say i'm running a certain service

640
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:19,119
now came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would provide d for</font>

641
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">subdomain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> met mappings I run a VPN</font>

642
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,430
service I end up on this sub domain by

643
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,489
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay which may or may not happen</font>

644
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,930
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mapped onto a sub domain</font>

645
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:30,460
that will be the only configuration step

646
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,730
today you have to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non</font>

647
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,529
colliding<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFF be fer so the bit for the</font>

648
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">sub domain so that says this</font>

649
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:43,180
configuration step no no deployments the

650
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,279
deployment simplicity<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus protocol</font>

651
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,368
complexity the usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> traders I mean this</font>

652
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:52,140
is nothing you know that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

653
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,140
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of magic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wand or whatsoever</font>

654
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,450
more comments

655
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:09,919
I'm done thanks for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention I</font>

656
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:09,920
hope is with the team I took some<font color="#CCCCCC"> notes</font>

657
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:44,520
get one last night I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> eject we're</font>

658
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to eject to fix a</font>

659
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:56,560
true so what what order would you like

660
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:58,330
we registered prefix attributes less as

661
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,940
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the other two I don't care</font>

662
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,940
how thing let's go on reverse order

663
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,960
ok this is this is going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

664
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,700
fast because all of these drafts have

665
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,790
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented before so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

666
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:21,620
quick updates spfd discriminators next

667
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:24,190
there was one change which was there was

668
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,200
a conflict in the suggested code point

669
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,270
with one that had been suggested in the

670
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">second rounding draft so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've resolved</font>

671
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that conflict that's the only change</font>

672
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:38,839
since Honolulu as far as we're concerned

673
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:42,169
the draft is complete and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

674
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:45,650
ask for last call once the base spfd

675
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:49,730
draft goes to last call in the BFD

676
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:52,190
working group we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do the</font>

677
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:56,960
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yes I left this in this has</font>

678
00:37:52,190 --> 00:38:06,910
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented before any questions</font>

679
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:06,910
about the spfd draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

680
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:27,800
okay Rob preference draft next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

681
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:32,330
again this is complete there have been

682
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,490
no comments since Honolulu we're

683
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:36,259
delaying last call because there is a

684
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,819
dependency on the prefix attributes

685
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,490
draft which is the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'm going</font>

686
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about so again that's all I have</font>

687
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:46,450
to say about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this unless anybody has any</font>

688
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,450
comments about raw preference

689
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:05,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay prefix attributes next slide since</font>

690
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">V</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 there's been some editorial clean up</font>

691
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:12,250
the biggest issue was there were two

692
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:15,609
proposals there was a competing proposal

693
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:18,789
to as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as advertising multiple node</font>

694
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:20,770
addresses there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a discussion</font>

695
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:23,140
between the authors of both drafts and

696
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,180
we've reached agreement that we're going

697
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:32,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the solution in the prefix</font>

698
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:35,379
attributes draft next slide so I put

699
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:37,390
this in red because there are two

700
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,049
documents that are dependent<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

701
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,098
progress of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document one is the</font>

702
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference draft that I talked about</font>

703
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:46,930
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other is the segment</font>

704
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,309
routing draft because some of the bits

705
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:52,660
that were defining for prefect

706
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:53,859
attributes are also defined in they were

707
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">originally defined in the segment</font>

708
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:58,538
routing draft we move them here because

709
00:39:56,049 --> 00:40:01,619
they had applications outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

710
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:04,359
routing so the plan is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

711
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,549
deprecated the do the duplicated bits in

712
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,680
the segment routing draft but clearly we

713
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:10,450
cannot do that until people can actually

714
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,759
go ahead and implement the prefix

715
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">attributes trap which means we want to</font>

716
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,119
become a working group item we want to

717
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:20,170
get early allocation code points as

718
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:22,210
quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so I would really</font>

719
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:26,680
like to progress this as quickly as

720
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:31,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all I have any</font>

721
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:33,899
questions comments is there anyone in

722
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:37,599
the room right now that objects to this

723
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:42,369
becoming a working group document hum

724
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,200
raise your hands and thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

725
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:46,559
we'll take it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

726
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,558
adoption

727
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:26,010
make sure you stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the pink box hello</font>

728
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:30,149
everybody my name is Uma today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

729
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:33,710
going to present encapsulation

730
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:37,770
capabilities in my assess next like this

731
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,510
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not specifically for spring</font>

732
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,850
personally this is envisioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> for spring</font>

733
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,430
incremental deployments we have fused

734
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,980
cases my interest in the strap first few

735
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:49,290
use cases where small routers where we

736
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,510
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have mpls but we want to do</font>

737
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:55,859
traffic engineering in mobile cell

738
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:57,450
stations where only you have is routing

739
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:01,009
capabilities but on the edge notes you

740
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:04,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">can put a spring and a controller can</font>

741
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:06,390
put the paths explicit paths and divert

742
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:09,180
the traffic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was my interest in</font>

743
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">this trap so later on there are a couple</font>

744
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,060
of other use cases where incremental

745
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,940
deployment is needed and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer where</font>

746
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,250
you don't support mpls and just pure IP

747
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:23,310
but on edge notes you have mpls

748
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,280
capability with the segment routing with

749
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,970
beer so in those kind of situations

750
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,430
advertising the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d capsulation</font>

751
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:32,490
capabilities of that i Gress node will

752
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,770
be very useful so this draft is about

753
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:38,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertising those capabilities in high</font>

754
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">gps and especially in this case is s so</font>

755
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:45,570
the new use case was remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> LF a case in</font>

756
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:48,029
pure IP networks where PQ node wanted to

757
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">ties it's d capsulation capabilities to</font>

758
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:54,240
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece pace notes this is not</font>

759
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">documented in the track this is a still</font>

760
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:02,970
in discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> bruno suggested this and</font>

761
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:05,220
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on this next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right-click so</font>

762
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,439
as I said this enables ingress ip-based

763
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:12,720
tunnel to know I'm capsulation type to

764
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,970
use and this has a huge advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I in</font>

765
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,368
operations basically need not config any

766
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,810
time any type of stuff you know on each

767
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:22,580
node like admin tax that's kind of

768
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:28,320
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> expended next active</font>

769
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:31,590
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are asking is a sub tlv in</font>

770
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,570

the encapsulation capability are

772
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,650
basically it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> V capsulation</font>

773
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,230
capability to be specific after i Gress

774
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:45,170
node and the associated parameters for

775
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:48,450
that the gap / incapability the current

encapsulation we didn't put the IP

779
00:43:53,160 --> 00:44:03,839
encapsulation set so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list will be</font>

780
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:07,530
updated next like this so we thank Bruno

789
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:31,370
key and we look for more inputs and

couple of 2 comments first of all this

794
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:52,160
is a general problem that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

795
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,759
related or specific to segment routing

796
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:59,990
it is more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a how do I bridge to mpls</font>

798
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,430
specific to a remote LFA or how to

799
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,840
decide the PQ note again it's a general

problem how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I choose the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peak you</font>

801
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,050

803
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:19,040
problem since the creation of mpls when

804
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,630
it was called back switching and i am

805
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,400
sure people have solved this problem how

806

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bridge to mpls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> islands over an IP</font>

808
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:33,110
routing protocol and one way as I

809
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,640
suggested to do it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use admin tags</font>

810
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,450
there are other node admin tags or

811
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,109
prefix admin tags or configuration in

812
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:44,960
other words I don't see a need for such

813
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:47,270
extension for a problem that existed<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

pgp is not you'd so it's straightforward

vein of brainstorming<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ockman has</font>

831
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:01,740
suggested that prefix admin tags could

832
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:04,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to do this one potential</font>

833
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,660
advantage of using prefix admin tags

834
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:09,150
which i think is something dear to your

835
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,240
heart by the way Mumma is that it would

836
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:15,530
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> implicitly tie the endpoint address</font>

837
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,779
that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to the tunnel type</font>

838
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:20,880
it's just a thought so I'll answer both

839
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,340
the questions first for your question we

840
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,290
can use admin tax but it requires

841
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,090
changes in the code to also said

842
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,340
typically to the admin tax<font color="#CCCCCC"> use but</font>

843
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:32,940
basically for redistribution you stick a

844
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:35,010
tag on the prefix and that prefix is the

845
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,570
attribute for your stuffer for

846
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,340
redistribution between the levels are

847
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,590
leaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be used thats all is</font>

848
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">there for today and if you want to put</font>

849
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,780
associated parameters probably if we

850
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:47,490
were tunnel pipe it requires particular

851
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,530
IP address you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it cannot</font>

852
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,660
be generic and it requires code change

853
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not straightforward actually this</font>

854
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,500
is a straightforward approach any way

855
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,820
that also my code changes required<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

856
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a more straightforward approach more</font>

857
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">generic approach I mean we can take this</font>

858
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:08,910
to the list but for the record I don't

859
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's so difficult so you cannot</font>

860
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:16,350
put a GRE key for example an admin tag

861
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:20,160
actually shampoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> from poway in fact I</font>

862
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:24,049
have noticed there are attempt to use a

863
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:32,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">different way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to advertise no capability</font>

864
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:36,960
that is to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefix by Stan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keowee</font>

865
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think both the size and the ospf</font>

866
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,170
should the sails away consider whether

867
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:47,910
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need two different approaches to do</font>

868
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:50,820
the same work think the point that I'm

869
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:53,040
trying to make is that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

870
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 year old problem that nobody</font>

871
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,460
has complained about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

872
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:02,140
it popped in the past few months

873
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,360
so so I'm a question actually we

874
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:08,080
discussed amadon this very elaborately

875
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,910
so as she mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-bjp environment</font>

876
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,450
is useful for me the signal trotting use

877
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:15,040
cases when explicit path is meant is

878
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:19,000
crafted by a controller and put it at

879
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,100
the ingress node when a node encounters

880
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,550
the neighbor is not spring or beer

881
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,410
capable we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Newt whatever</font>

882
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,180
what we need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb is not there</font>

883
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,220
actually so immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know the</font>

884
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,620
tunnel endpoint and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its capability is</font>

885
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:38,319
with you at dingus node it's quite

886
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:40,660
useful and automatic actually um i would

887
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,390
like to repeat this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest i would</font>

888
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:46,450
like to repeat the comment that i gave

889
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:49,240
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ospf working group it looks to me</font>

case to use such a to use DGP do you

916
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:27,370
suggest to establish bgp sessions

917
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:36,069
between all nodes within the beer now

918
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:38,319
the domain 20 p so whether a router

919
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:40,240
supports beer can be very easily derived

920
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,840
from the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it announced a beer</font>

00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,040
a straight for subtly it will require

929
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:21,009
configuration so the same configuration

930
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,080
effort is needed or actually less

931
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:25,000
configuration effort is needed by using

932
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,790
admin tags you can add you can achieve

933
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,920
the same exact result with admin tags

934
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:32,410
you go to the routers configure them for

935

admin tag number<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten use GRE admin tech</font>

946
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:03,790
days who keep telling me it call can be

947
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,400
solved with static routing so you don't

948
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,910
really need then<font color="#CCCCCC"> imma cropping protocols</font>

949
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:17,569
at all

950
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:21,529
so so so obviously well tags generic tax

951
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:24,829
no tax prefix tags are sort of last

952
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:27,049
resort exits for solving a problem the

953
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:29,240
problem that gets a bit lost is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

954
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:32,089
they are context three so those texts do

955
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:35,328
not really have any semantics and I

956
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:37,700
think for since this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> data plane</font>

957
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:44,480
implications are they would like to

958
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:46,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">carry on those semantics all right well</font>

959
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is an interesting discussion that</font>

960
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:51,410
maybe we'll publish on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list as well</font>

961
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:53,329
everyone's opinions out there but I

962
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:59,660
think less you were suggesting something

963
00:53:53,329 --> 00:54:04,000
similar with tags<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks</font>

964
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:04,000
thanks Kristi thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks thank you</font>

965
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:28,019
good morning everybody and shad da will

966
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:31,429
be talking about the link overload

967
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:33,928
feature in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISS a similar feature was</font>

968
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:37,169
draft was described in ospf working

969
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:39,659
group as well so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a same feature</font>

970
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:42,469
being protocol extensions for the same

971
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:42,469
feature in a sense

972
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:50,719
so we have the node overload feature

973
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,940
wearing you can set<font color="#E5E5E5"> a note to overload</font>

974
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:55,969
before picking it down for the

975
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:59,119
maintenance so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are trying to</font>

976
00:54:55,969 --> 00:55:02,900
extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same functionality to the</font>

977
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,209
overlay networks so this diagram shows a

978
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,150
typical overlay Network<font color="#CCCCCC"> where in the</font>

979
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:09,979
seas are connected over or in overlay so

980
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,469
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier devices are not visible to the</font>

981
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:15,709
sea devices so when the t's go for

982
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:19,670
maintenance before taking it out for a

983
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:22,969
maintenance you need to divert the

984
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:26,329
traffic from the link to the other link

985
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:28,130
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an alternate link so if p1 is</font>

986
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:32,479
going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> for maintenance traffic from</font>

987
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:35,299
cee blue one has to get diverted yrp e

988
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:37,729
to the link which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why a PE 2 and</font>

989
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:42,140
similarly the traffic from see you too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

990
00:55:37,729 --> 00:55:44,209
need to be get diverted why a PE for so

991
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,729
whereas it's easy to avoid the traffic

992
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:50,859
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a blue one it's difficult to do</font>

993
00:55:46,729 --> 00:55:53,899
the same on the from the remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> site so</font>

994
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:56,239
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do manual</font>

995
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,609
configuration on all the remote ends to

996
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:02,799
say a to divert the traffic to the other

997
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:02,799
link<font color="#CCCCCC"> next time please</font>

998
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,410
so we just described in the problem that

999
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:18,490
you know manual configuration is

1000
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:22,279
difficult and and the next slide please

1001
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:24,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is a this is a similar problem</font>

1002
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,920
described for the overlay broadcast

1003
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:32,560
networks so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an overlay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1004
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,850
over IRB interfaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> where in the sea red</font>

1005
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,310
devices here they appear to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a</font>

1006
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,470
broadcast network so here also the

1007
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is same if p1 goes for</font>

1008
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:43,370
maintenance you probably want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> divert</font>

1009
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:46,250
the traffic before the p1 is taken out

1010
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:47,720
for maintenance this is useful if you

1011
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,030
know operators want to give it as a

1012
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:53,450
service to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer that they will</font>

1013
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:56,290
make sure that traffic is diverted

1014
00:56:53,450 --> 00:57:00,290
before the P is taken for maintenance

1015
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:02,630
makes like things<font color="#E5E5E5"> the motivation is ease</font>

1016
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:10,910
of maintenance automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgradation and</font>

1017
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:12,620
minimize traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> large make circles so</font>

1018
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,600
what you're suggesting is to carry the

1019
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:18,589
link overload built in the link

1020
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:20,900
attributes tlv sub tlv which is RFC 5209

1021
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:23,510
so just define a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in the link</font>

1022
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,610
overload sorry a link overload bit in

1023
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:33,290
the link attribute your game carry it

1024
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:36,470
along with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's is extended reach</font>

1025
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,390
tlv which is tlv number 22 so the

1026
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:40,910
receiver it identifies the connecting

1027
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,799
link increases the metric to max metric

1028
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:47,509
so this metric needs to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> usable</font>

1029
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:49,310
metric so that in case there is no

1030
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:52,220
alternate paths traffic still continues

1031
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:54,740
to flow on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> refluxed I LSB</font>

1032
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:56,299
and traffic is directed away from the

1033
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,979
old ordered link and then link is ready

1034
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:02,300
for maintenance it's like please

1035
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:05,390
similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the broadcast links the D</font>

1037
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:14,509
the link updates the match metric for

1038
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:16,049
the originating node and then reflux the

1039
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:18,269
Sudan or LSP

1040
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:21,420
that and the traffic is diverted away

1041
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:26,879
from that link and then the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

1042

1047
00:58:52,590 --> 00:59:02,940
couple of questions one why would you

00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:05,700
put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit into the LSP advertisements</font>

1049
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:09,210
rather than the hello given that the

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> person are the only know that's of</font>

1051
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:15,300
going to do anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your</font>

1052
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:18,779
neighbor yeah that's true only the

1053
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:21,120
neighbor would act on this but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1054
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,510
can reuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existing theories and it's</font>

1055
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,130
just a bit I think it's not very

1056
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:29,010
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we define the procedure</font>

1057
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:33,900
that only the remote end of the link is

1058
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:35,850
going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it so it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

1059
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,740
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the only the neighbor is going</font>

1060
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:40,200
to act<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it well one of the</font>

1061
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:43,859
consequences of putting it into tlv 22

1062
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:46,230
is if you have parallel links to the

1063
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:48,120
same neighbor you're now forced to

1064
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,430
advertise and they're they're equal cost

1065
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:52,589
you're not forced to advertise all of

1066
00:59:50,430 --> 01:00:03,960
them which in some scenarios is not

1067
00:59:52,590 --> 01:00:10,710
necessary interface address and the

1068
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:13,050
neighbors so that's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> true but if I</font>

1069
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:15,570
have multiple links to the same neighbor

1070
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're equal cost unless I'm doing</font>

1071
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,170
traffic engineering there's no

1072
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,089
requirement to advertise both of the

1073
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:23,490
neighbors because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the point of view</font>

1074
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:25,890
building the SBT just saying I have a

1075
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:29,549
neighbor to you know to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a cost</font>

01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:31,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 is sufficient so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1077
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,350
another reason why it would be much

1078
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:36,360
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you put this in the hope that</font>

1079
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:38,940
the follow-on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

1080
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,210
you're familiar with the reverse metric

1081
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,210
draft

1082
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I mean did was it just that you</font>

1083
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:57,270
weren't aware of it or did you talk to

1084
01:00:54,060 --> 01:01:01,350
those authors it's expired yeah fair

1085
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:04,259
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a jeweler Reese erected well</font>

1086
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:06,750
in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion and and you know I was</font>

1087
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:10,170
never a fan of the reverse metric idea

1088
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:13,920
but and now you're gonna play<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no I'm</font>

1089
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:15,930
not fighting for what I'm saying I'm

1090
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,119
saying if we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this i</font>

1091
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:19,770
believe the solution to find in the

1092
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:24,540
reverse metric draft is the correct

1093
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:27,450
solution and oh by the way maybe those

1094
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,970
authors deserve some credit so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1095
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:33,899
can collaborate but you know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1096
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:36,720
my problem um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really think if</font>

1097
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,640
we're going to do this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1098
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,230
definitely should look at the reverse

1099
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:49,290
symmetric solution and I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1100
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:52,170
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it oh ma from erickson first I have</font>

1101
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:54,900
one small comment on the draft just a

1102
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:56,790
clarification basically in ISS version

1103
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,430
of the Star a draft you still talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1104
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:02,600
dr and bdr probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct that</font>

1105
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:05,460
language so that's one comment and

1106
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,680
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reverse metric the power</font>

1107
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,960
Traverse metric has a lot of concern for

1108
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,339
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you are changing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1109
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,840
metric of the other side on the fly so

1110
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">people may not like it operational</font>

1111
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,720
account with a lot of discussion in the

1112
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,090
mail<font color="#E5E5E5"> English probably might want to see</font>

1113
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is another approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

pushpa sheesh juniper question<font color="#CCCCCC"> too less</font>

1115
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:36,630
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of agree the reverse metric does</font>

1116
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:40,350
solve this problem and I also agree to

1117
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:44,220
your comment that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this should drop</font>

1118
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:47,910
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on the hello you need not</font>

1119
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:50,730
be on the LSP but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a question to</font>

1120
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:55,100
you back again forgive my ignorance is

1121
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a reverse metric draft in ospf</font>

1122
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:03,359
I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Derby yeah that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1123
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:06,119
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually say so instead of</font>

1124
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:08,578
resurrecting the reverse metric we can

1125
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:10,650
actually have these two drops already

1126
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:14,490
proposed across the 22 working groups

1127
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:16,740
are I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's other alternative of</font>

1128
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:26,848
adding one in ospf for the reverse

1129
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:30,029
metric AC<font color="#CCCCCC"> lindum your colleague has a</font>

1130
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:32,339
very similar draft in ospf where the

1131
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:37,230
encoding could be we have the two-part

1132
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:38,730
metric which is for certain types of so

1133
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,420
there is encoding for more than one

1134
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:47,160
metric there is not per se a reverse

1135
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:49,260
metric AC the the other comment I would

1136
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,299
make is it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more difficult in</font>

1137
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:55,130
ospf because you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a metric in</font>

1138
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:59,480
the network LSA so for the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lands</font>

1139
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:59,480
we have to find some way to solve that

1140
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:11,910
so um just my read of the room how much

1141
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you are the opinion that we should</font>

1142
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:23,490
have a comparable well if not identical

1143
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:25,980
mechanism and the boeuf I GPS yeah he's

1144
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:30,000
leaving out and open I think I think

1145
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:32,210
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trying just to get some</font>

1146
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,210
sense

1147
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:44,619
yeah yeah you are AC<font color="#CCCCCC"> lindam we agreed to</font>

1148
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:46,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about whether this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font>

1149
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:51,820
or not in the ospf working group whether

1150
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:54,730
this is this scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh why you need to</font>

1151
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:57,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this not as opposed to how you need</font>

1152
01:04:54,730 --> 01:05:01,990
to do it and that's the first I think

1153
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:12,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first question I mean ie ok i</font>

1154
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:14,649
sent to verizon guys into you away well

1155
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,750
I think house was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going for is that we</font>

1156
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:19,900
probably shouldn't have two different

1157
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:28,740
methods and just it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the same</font>

1158
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">in both I GPS less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skin perk I I</font>

1159
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:32,799
mean what we've consistently done with

1160
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:35,410
these kinds of things in the past is we

1161
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,930
provide equivalent functionality but the

1162
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:41,290
actual mechanisms in terms of encodings

1163
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:43,000
are or what's best for each protocol I

1164
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:46,440
don't see why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should deviate from</font>

1165
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,119
that if it's and I think in this case

1166
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,550
certainly for is is if we're going to do

1167
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:56,430
this the hello is the appropriate place

1168
01:05:51,550 --> 01:06:01,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put this information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fair enough</font>

1169
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:01,830
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thank you</font>

1170
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:24,549
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone and then my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1171
01:06:21,999 --> 01:06:27,368
wine merchant from Huawei so today I'm

1172
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:32,739
going to talk about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a party in</font>

1173
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:36,329
perinton totally cool t-d-z so give the

1174
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:39,459
introduction extension to ISS and then

1175
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:43,630
HP updates for ttc an adjacency whiskey

1176
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:46,538
busy next so let's the level becomes

1177
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:49,109
bigger and bigger and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1178
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:51,789
split up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladder book into more areas</font>

1179
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:54,308
so when we do this bleeding and then we

1180
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:58,449
have some issues such as the surface

1181
01:06:54,309 --> 01:07:00,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be interrupted because the note</font>

1182
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:04,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">will link with old area we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going down</font>

1183
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:06,219
and then those notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and linked with new</font>

1184
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:09,519
area that come up so during<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process</font>

1185
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:12,069
the surface that will be interrupted so

1186
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:17,439
also for splitting laterally into more

1187
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:20,229
areas we know this is a very big<font color="#CCCCCC"> madoka</font>

1188
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:24,459
a cracka change so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very very</font>

1189
01:07:20,229 --> 01:07:28,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenging task in addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

1190
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:31,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">time-consuming when doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speak so</font>

1191
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:35,709
whether mo may be very complex for

1192
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:40,170
another in the art piece so tdz will

1193
01:07:35,709 --> 01:07:44,819
resolve these issues in Ostia we have

1194
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:49,829
implementations and we have showed that

1195
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:54,999
ospf tdz can resolve these three issues

1196
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:59,529
so with ospf tdz so we show that we can

1197
01:07:54,999 --> 01:08:03,629
transfer a part of life work smoothly to

1198
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:07,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">tdz without any surface interruption</font>

1199
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:14,469
also we do the transport transformation

1200
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:17,319
the operation is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple so also</font>

1201
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:20,939
the ospf DVD is a walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot document</font>

1202
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,940
right now so like slice

1203
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:31,939
so tdz so tv3 the virtualization

1204
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:37,308
technology is a virtualized a part of

1205
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:40,219
the network as the ages of this part for

1206
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:46,309
the connected so this part of ladakh we

1207
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:51,828
call a TDC topology at random<font color="#CCCCCC"> so outside</font>

1208
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:56,739
of this tdz any no<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MTDC is not</font>

1209
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:59,778
aware of key disease so it will only see

1210
01:08:56,738 --> 01:09:02,268
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fully connected we'll see this</font>

1211
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:05,420
virtualized a topology so those are

1212
01:09:02,269 --> 01:09:08,179
linked inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G knows have a link</font>

1213
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:10,969
well now to see not not not be at

1214
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:17,989
advertise through outside of ttc so like

1215
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:22,309
slice next one so to support i assessed

1216
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:26,448
EDG we just need one POV called the td's

1217
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:30,699
et al vs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> TVs et al v contains some</font>

1218
01:09:26,448 --> 01:09:34,549
flags and PDC ID and then a cup of

1219
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:38,118
software of ease so<font color="#E5E5E5"> four flags so this</font>

1220
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:41,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just copying from or spear so we have</font>

1221
01:09:38,118 --> 01:09:45,288
weekly find five flags so one flag is

1222
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:48,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flag is the edge of a trot of</font>

1223
01:09:45,288 --> 01:09:52,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">TDD so this flag indicate this router is</font>

1224
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:55,729
a edge router of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDD and then these four</font>

1225
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:58,820
frankly is just for our migration a part

1226
01:09:55,729 --> 01:10:02,599
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladakh through tdz and under and then</font>

1227
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:05,929
some of crack is used for grew back at

1228
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:09,139
EDD to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lomo metal for example for</font>

1229
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:12,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">migration a part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life to TDC we just</font>

1230
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:14,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">used two flags one flag is that PFLAG</font>

1231
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:18,499
for distribution of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDD information and</font>

1232
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:21,709
then an as-applied is for migration<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1233
01:10:18,499 --> 01:10:24,380
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blackrock include EDD so for</font>

1234
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">sabit lv so normally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have one start a</font>

1235
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">list which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> T DT is labels safavieh so</font>

1236
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:35,410
next slice

1237
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:42,280
so for TDC is labor support lv<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

1238
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:47,769
consists of a lambo of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PVC labels so</font>

1239
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:55,059
like slice so here we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give those</font>

1240
01:10:47,770 --> 01:11:00,340
how we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> LSP to virtualize the TSST</font>

1241
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:06,370
disease so for each internal router

1242
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:09,820
inside the t-d-z so we just ate<font color="#CCCCCC"> t-d-z</font>

1243
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:13,240
tlv so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v with a flag</font>

1244
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:18,910
equal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 which indicates that this is</font>

1245
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:22,690
a internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> TD router and also with a TV</font>

1246
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">GID for example with CDs ID 1 100 so</font>

1247
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:29,410
that's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> justly so for internal router</font>

1248
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:34,770
is easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one kov TVD healthy with e</font>

1249
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">equals 0 and the PID so for any router</font>

1250
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for 88 year old of TDC so we just have</font>

1251
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:47,710
is LLP with a pdz tlv so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV GTA V</font>

1252
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:50,620
where have a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal to 1 which</font>

1253
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:56,890
indicates that I'm at EDC edge router

1254
01:11:50,620 --> 01:12:00,250
and also it will have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDD is and stop</font>

1255
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:04,420
at lv so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a betrayal v will</font>

1256
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:09,190
contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the t-d-z labels for example</font>

1257
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:11,530
here this is a page out of TDC so the

1258
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:15,099
suburb POV the subtlety of a disturbance

1259
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:19,840
near we will contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the label p 1 and</font>

1260
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:24,490
then the labeled t5 and then label ta so

1261
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:29,740
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this information we ever router</font>

1262
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:35,679
insert a TD<font color="#CCCCCC"> tdz can determine the pdz</font>

1263
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:40,000
domain containing the TDC because for

1264
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:43,840
each internal rotor we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDD tlv we</font>

1265
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:47,219
have a flag in turn

1266
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:51,610
so this indicate a for internal router

1267
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:56,139
every a Jason router is a TD g router so

1268
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:58,659
48<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotors because we have tdz is M</font>

1274
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:21,820
virtualizing tdz we just ate the other

1275
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:24,849
ages as is La Paz but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> dunno here for</font>

1276
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:28,630
this edge router we just added the other

1277
01:13:24,849 --> 01:13:32,260
ht1 the answer a gt3 and the delta agt

1278
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:36,460
3s is labels so with those information

1279
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:40,030
Amy road outside can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

virtualizer that virtualizer the metal

01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece easy so this virtualized path</font>

1282
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:47,770
because this is just that normal is

1283
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:52,239
labels so from outside you just see

1284
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:55,030
these normal connections so from outside

1285
01:13:52,239 --> 01:14:00,400
is just see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lomo virtualized of that</font>

01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:12,360
next slide so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> agency is a symbol so</font>

1288
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:17,500
when we configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttz so we will add a</font>

1289
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:21,790
tdz tlv with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDC ID into hallows so</font>

1290
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:24,130
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> both side if we decide that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TDI</font>

1291
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">dr same and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can form the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TTC</font>

1292
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:28,989
adjacencies so if they don't same and

1293
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:33,848
then we don't inform that it is adjacent

1294
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:37,900
least so for at TDC a drover it<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms</font>

1295
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:40,570
adjacency with the road outside in the

1296
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:45,670
normal way you can separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1297
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:48,309
just synchronize the database example

1298
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:49,900
those internal informations the internal

1299
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:52,270
information will now stimulus to our

1300
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,989
side that's the only difference so next

1301
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:57,440
page

1302
01:14:53,989 --> 01:15:01,190
so this page we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saw the operation</font>

1303
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:04,549
of migrations so for for my great a part

1304
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:06,710
of network into a TDC just follow these

1305
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:10,309
three steps very simple steps three

1306
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:13,999
steps first which has a configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDD so</font>

1307
01:15:10,309 --> 01:15:16,969
for comfy tdg normally just one command

1308
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:19,400
on each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttg routers so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

1309
01:15:16,969 --> 01:15:21,949
TVD of this world config aren't easy and

1310
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rods get one commands so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after we</font>

1311
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:30,409
configure tdz and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use one</font>

1312
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:33,650
command for hope for how this network

1313
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:36,440
but what is half this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera is</font>

1314
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:39,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">trigger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the TDC information is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jewish</font>

1315
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:44,119
distribution one command for ho papa and

1316
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:46,389
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third step is that we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1317
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:51,139
only one comment on any one of the note

1318
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:54,829
for migration of this path to t disease

1319
01:15:51,139 --> 01:15:57,650
so sorry steps that's from operation per

1320
01:15:54,829 --> 01:16:01,909
view is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy so from the</font>

1321
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:05,629
inside so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we configure tdz then we</font>

1322
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:07,789
will discover t disease as i mentioned

1323
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:11,119
that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put hallo for the TV Guide</font>

1324
01:16:07,789 --> 01:16:14,739
PDD tlv with a pdz ID in the hollows and

1325
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:17,598
then we can discover tdz adjacencies and

1326
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:20,058
then other after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first step the</font>

1327
01:16:17,599 --> 01:16:26,320
second set of eyes that every TV router

1328
01:16:20,059 --> 01:16:30,320
just add TV gTLDs into their a las veas

1329
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:34,190
so this additive<font color="#E5E5E5"> steak so this curve</font>

1330
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:36,409
cause one to the second step so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDD</font>

1331
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:40,308
information will be distributing in the

1332
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:42,888
network so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDD will be discovered</font>

1333
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:46,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a determined and then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last step</font>

1334
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:50,179
is that we use one command on any one of

1335
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:53,539
the routers of TDC migrate is part of

1336
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:58,010
radical 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> t disease so for this command</font>

1337
01:16:53,539 --> 01:17:01,340
is will trigger the AG router to

1338
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:07,580
virtualize a DVD so the ADA router will

1339
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:10,250
add those kind of virtual labels

1340
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:13,940
means the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author ages as there is</font>

1341
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:16,850
labels and then also if they are now to

1342
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:19,429
do with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> t-d-z information to our</font>

1343
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:22,340
side so that's time so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

1344
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:24,080
those three steps from outside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1345
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,630
three steps from the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

1346
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:29,450
DVD is a transform without any stepha

1347
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:31,700
stepha interruptions and also the

1348
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:36,980
operation is very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> street</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or done</font>

1349
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:39,200
symbol so next step so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff we</font>

1350
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:41,950
would like more comments from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1351
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group</font>

01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:58,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ginsburg it is possible today with</font>

1353
01:17:53,809 --> 01:18:02,499
the base protocol to quite easily and

1354
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:05,419
non disruptively merge and split areas

1355
01:18:02,499 --> 01:18:08,349
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't require any extensions in order</font>

1356
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:11,539
to do that it derives from the fact that

1357
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:15,760
you can configure multiple area

1358
01:18:11,539 --> 01:18:18,768
addresses on a given box and when you do

1359
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:22,699
they become synonyms for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same area</font>

1360
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:25,249
for all the routers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area I won't</font>

1361
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:27,289
spend the time in the meeting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1362
01:18:25,249 --> 01:18:30,019
through the steps but it's very

1363
01:18:27,289 --> 01:18:32,419
straightforward to split one area into

1364
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:34,729
two areas for example non-disruptive<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee</font>

1365
01:18:32,419 --> 01:18:39,889
with existing functionality in the

1366
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:42,530
protocol so with that in mind it isn't

1367
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:46,610
clear to me why we would invent another

1368
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:49,639
extension to do the same thing you mean

1369
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:52,339
so you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not bring the link atang with</font>

1370
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:55,280
the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> area or not bring the loaded up</font>

1371
01:18:52,340 --> 01:19:01,159
with the old area we just uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

1372
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:03,099
this none<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptively so you can give</font>

1373
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:05,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">up these multi tails and then we can</font>

1374
01:19:03,099 --> 01:19:09,619
yeah maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss that</font>

1375
01:19:05,929 --> 01:19:14,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you but it's a in a well-known</font>

1376
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:14,919
procedure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1377
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:23,269
long we leave for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maui so actually this</font>

1378
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,150
can solve much more than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1379
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:29,480
described and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example recently I saw</font>

1380
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:32,629
an operator they have a network so they

1381
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:35,299
upgrade from one continuous louder's to

1382
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:39,170
another company's routers but somehow in

1383
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:42,170
the pub they forgot to like take<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1384
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:45,739
out loads out two loaders still there

1385
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:49,310
but it's misbehaving so but if the

1386
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:52,809
configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> disease something like that so</font>

1387
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:55,880
that like a loose link<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

1388
01:19:52,810 --> 01:20:01,130
advertisement will not be popped out so

1389
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:05,600
it can minimize like and the combines

1390
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:08,540
the rail system and disruption and on

1391
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,980
other hand and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology and this</font>

1392
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:15,500
extension can use your topology

1393
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:18,349
complexity because without yet in your

1394
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">topologies that tables may be bigger so</font>

1395
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:23,780
there are multiple application is it's

1396
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:30,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not only for like a splitting your</font>

1397
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:34,849
network into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller ones this is</font>

1398
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:38,870
harness um I do not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite agree</font>

1399
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:42,590
using vanilla mechanisms it can be done

1400
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:45,980
but I certainly would agree that for

1401
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:52,420
example using multi instance is is to

1402
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:57,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">model a TTC song</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be done right</font>

1403
01:20:52,420 --> 01:21:00,010
so either way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there is already</font>

1404
01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:07,280
some tooling that we have in the toolbox

1405
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:12,080
to sort of model those zones and I would

1406
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:17,110
like to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether ye reuse of those</font>

1407
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,110
tools than to reinvent something new

1408
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:23,570
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like to look at as tools but I</font>

1409
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:26,960
do I don't know whether that true can

1410
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:28,820
replace or all the functionalities here

1411
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,650
well why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mean given you know</font>

1412
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,900
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> less is mentioning about the</font>

1413
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:34,460
multiple areas and stuff why don't we

1414
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:37,129
take this to the list and flush out

1415
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:44,140
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can solve this problem with</font>

1416
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:44,140
what we have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

1417
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:52,449
I think that's very best

1418
01:21:54,440 --> 01:22:00,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was our last presentation</font>

1419
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:06,900
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody have any thing else to add</font>

1420
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the meeting all right great thanks a</font>

1421
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:16,710
lot see um proc hopefully on a different

1422
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:18,570
day than Friday I really worked hard to

1423
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:23,790
try to have it not happen this time but

1424
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:36,030
I i I'm gonna put almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero conflicts</font>

1425
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:51,030
down yeah that's true so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1426
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:53,840
Alpha we were almost the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Omega 0 the</font>

1433
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:59,800

01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,800
there somewhere ok

1435

1437
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:48,929

<font color="#CCCCCC">esaias i get done to like you but now</font>

1439
01:24:48,929 --> 01:25:06,780
i'm going to this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty clean line</font>

1440
01:24:51,900 --> 01:25:16,949
up here no it's not get up so I did I on

1441
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">my night actually went oh yes why he's</font>

1442
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:22,410
using 3.4 yeah he's probably using like

1443
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:24,510
a synchronous or whatever anyway I did I

1444
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:27,920
did it with memory you so I'm actually

1445
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:30,480
doing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 copper pipe down let's copy</font>

1446
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,160
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using memory views and I did a</font>

1447
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:35,400
single library extension so that i can

1448
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:37,860
actually poke and poke within that

1449
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:41,730
member you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the framing off from</font>

1450
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:44,160
throw that link but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i never copy like I</font>

1451
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:46,019
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry that memory buffer because</font>

1452
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,489
that was that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I thought like if</font>

1453
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:50,580
I'm going to see any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of serious</font>

1454
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:52,019
degradation in performance will Python I

1455
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,909
thought it's probably going to be from

1456
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,459
copying things all the time

1457
01:25:53,909 --> 01:25:57,989
so I said let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me focus on minimizing</font>

1458
01:25:56,459 --> 01:26:00,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because only really one is a Python</font>

1459
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:04,009
eyes that actually performs as well as a

1460
01:26:00,059 --> 01:26:04,010
super or close enough single fellas
