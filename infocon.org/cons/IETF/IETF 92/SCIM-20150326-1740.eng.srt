1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,969
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> sam'l profiles and ldap</font>

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,000
mappings and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:19,110
gotten traction nobody stepped up to

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,580
write them some and so we you know set

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,080
on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of occasions that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody doesn't come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft</font>

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,180
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask to cut them from from</font>

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,580
from our shorter and and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:34,559
asking very to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to cut them from</font>

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,540
our shorter at this point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that leads</font>

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,979
us with you know having a discussion

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,739
about the future of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group</font>

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,610
which we're gonna do today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font>

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,570
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that by talking about some</font>

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,400
possible next steps for either this or

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:54,809
some follow-on working group doesn't

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,799
have to be what in one hole in one go so

18
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:03,989
we'll do some presentations from Phil

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:06,450
and motifs<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your own and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

20
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:11,759
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time left at the end of the session</font>

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,789
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want to do next so</font>

22
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:21,929
you want should we get going I don't

23
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:23,640
fill right that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point somebody</font>

24
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:30,750
has anything they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to the</font>

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:35,420
agenda I think he's we all read that

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:38,640
right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then we can jump into</font>

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,570
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it proposed notify</font>

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,570
extension for skin

29
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:55,100
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ghosts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stunning the books</font>

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:58,009
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a camera now so yeah we've been</font>

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,119
talking about something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

32
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:05,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">while I guess next slide almost since we</font>

33
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:08,959
started with skim let's go to the

34
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,729
introduction and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually sort of</font>

35
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,380
rereading the use case document and

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,930
right there in the use case document is

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,819
this concept called triggers because

38
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,519
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about spontaneous</font>

39
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,530
state changes and wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about</font>

40
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:27,440
the state changes before deciding what

41
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:30,470
to do so in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> current mandate this</font>

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,930
really talks about triggers<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve into</font>

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,840
actions that are taken which becomes the

44
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">skin protocol so really what we want to</font>

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,530
do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> then is provide that triggered</font>

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,480
formalize that trigger mechanism which

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,459
can be used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed data back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,828
provisioning system which then decides

49
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,380
what it wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and it may in turn</font>

50
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:56,660
do more skin operations somewhere else

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:03:02,709
in response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that so that's that's</font>

52
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:06,170
where we're coming from next slide so

53
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:10,730
two extreme cases on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spectrum one</font>

54
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:13,458
end to let domains coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with each</font>

55
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,850
other when changes have occurred another

56
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:19,250
one though could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very simple</font>

57
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,160
subscription against one resource so

58
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,840
that a mobile app can know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,630
users profile has changed for some

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,609
reason and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should go get the</font>

61
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:33,260
information or<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll just pass the app</font>

62
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:35,359
the information so there can be a feed

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,370
that describes one individual or it's

64
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:39,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one place and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font>

65
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,440
feeds that might represent your entire

66
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,480
repository and you could have thousands

67
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,940
of updates per second so that's sort of

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme thing and there are probably</font>

69
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:54,500
many use cases in between a lot of it

70
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,110
comes from our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> who want to</font>

71
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,920
coordinate things that are happening in

72
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,810
their enterprise

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,390
domain and things that are happening

74
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,489
independently in the cloud and they may

75
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,988
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up rules if this changes in</font>

76
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,610
the cloud we're going to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

77
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">our side to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coordinate that what that is</font>

78
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,920
really depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the business</font>

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,230
scenario is so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple</font>

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,488
because their name changed or their role

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,520
changed here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't necessarily</font>

82
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:24,049
mean the receiving domain thinks that

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,120
that's interesting or not it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

84
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:35,360
to know next slide so the general

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:38,210
architecture is one where we define a

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,139
notification hub which is receives

87
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,210
events from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skin service provider</font>

88
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:47,000
that can be actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same server but</font>

89
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,799
the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to offload the</font>

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,620
work of delivering those messages and

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,729
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out which subscribers need to</font>

92
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,340
be notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> once an event has occurred</font>

93
00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally that broad architecture we</font>

94
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,710
broadly took from spec called

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,720
pubsubhubbub and that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

96
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,640
what we took from that was the idea that

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,250
sometimes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offload this</font>

98
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,930
activity because you want your skim

99
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,360
service rider to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,400
changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's processing and we</font>

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,530
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to maintain a historical</font>

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,390
history like we did with ldap and have a

103
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">change law kind of thing where clients</font>

104
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,020
are constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying the changelog is</font>

105
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,950
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed as anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font>

106
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,390
we'd rather have event messages just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

107
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:34,280
delivered for those that are interested

108
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:36,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a service take care of that one</font>

109
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about this in</font>

110
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hawaii and we said well doesn't web push</font>

111
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:46,310
do this and it does but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the</font>

112
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,840
delivery mechanism and what we're

113
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,450
talking about is sort of the information

114
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,460
plan related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> skim as to how I define</font>

115
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,190
a feed what are the messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

116
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,580
forth and then to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> web push is just</font>

117
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,830
one possible way to deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> it another</font>

118
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,710
two possibilities sort of in a restful

119
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,620
model is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll call it call back where</font>

120
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,099
the hub does an HTTP POST to a

121
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,240
subscriber or if I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go across a</font>

122
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,880
firewall and

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:19,160
prize might do an hdb get to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

124
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:22,159
events on some frequency that get means

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,020
then the notification hub has to be

126
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,990
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with how many events can its</font>

127
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,639
store over a period of time so if you

128
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,680
have high rate of<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of</font>

129
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,020
ops per second that can queue up fairly

130
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,460
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's something some</font>

131
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,889
flexibilities warranted there's also

132
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,460
mobile phones where we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple push</font>

133
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:42,199
notification Google message service and

134
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,948
window message service i'm not sure what

135
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:49,460
the name is now but so it occurs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

136
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:53,569
that we would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of registry</font>

137
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interface point that says this is</font>

138
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:58,370
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe a web push and how it</font>

139
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,210
works with<font color="#E5E5E5"> OAuth or works with sorry</font>

140
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,550
works with the notification system we're

141
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,638
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with registries in a lot this</font>

142
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:14,599
week so come on wrong standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next</font>

143
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide so typical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skim on the left</font>

144
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,909
a state change or a trigger occurs and

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,219
the provisioning system says okay I need

146
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to update my local repository and I need</font>

147
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:29,740
to update the other domain and so forth

148
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,810
that's the normal skin flow next slide

149
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,870
the interesting case now is if I had an

150
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,669
enterprise system on the left and say

151
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,039
Oracle cloud or Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cloud on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

152
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:45,109
right or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is state change</font>

153
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:47,389
occurs independently in the cloud what

154
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,099
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is set up some process</font>

155
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,590
whereby the enterprise can be notified

156
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that something's changed now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

157
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,489
include the actual data that's changed

158
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">there might be just John Bradley's</font>

159
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,419
record has changed you figure out what

160
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,710
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so eventually the event</font>

161
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,568
message gets sent back to the

162
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,239
provisioning controller it interprets

163
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:08,360
that and then decides what it needs to

164
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:14,960
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that event which means maybe</font>

165
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:19,589
updating its local repository next slide

166
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,688
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where it gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting in</font>

167
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:25,110
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just sort of mimicking a</font>

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth we also have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font>

170
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,710
there's add and remove I could have an

171
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,549
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> user which has been added to a</font>

00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:41,279
criteria the users either been manually

174
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,929
added to the feed or the users

175
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,820
something's changed about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and</font>

176
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:49,829
we just simply need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know hey this</font>

177
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,440
resource is now part of your feed then

178
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,199
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to create another high level one</font>

179
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,329
that seems to come up and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will also</font>

180
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:59,569
sort of come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a bit in more Tesla's</font>

181
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,189
presentation on soft delete the idea of

182
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:05,550
activate and deactivate I think is a

183
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between instead of doing a</font>

184
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,589
delete you might do a deactivate and a

185
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,180
deactivate really is a business concept

186
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:16,680
that says this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we mean by</font>

187
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">deactive like its status inactive but</font>

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,719
there seems to be that's an important

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,250
event to track independently of this

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,930
specific data has changed modified

191
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:35,250
delete password change I have that in

192
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:38,579
there to say as a talking point I'm not

193
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure if it stays long term it might</font>

require<font color="#E5E5E5"> special handling there are</font>

195
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,740

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,930
a deliverable but it's there so we can

198
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and then I have a</font>

199
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:58,079
confirmation type which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> special</font>

200
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,910
type that notify needs when you're

201
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,430
trying to set up a connection the

202
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,719
subscriber you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to confirm can</font>

203
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,839
you hear me<font color="#CCCCCC"> now can you hear me now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

204
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,339
got the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint so that's more of</font>

205
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,230
an administrative detail so that's just

206
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the where it is now if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

207
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:19,160
current draft we've published that's

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,920
what that's what's there now next slide

209
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,769
so the message is basically adjacent

210
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,219
message and it follows the scheme style

211
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:32,019
of formulating a message

212
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:35,680
then first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it has a ski most you</font>

213
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:37,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a publisher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URI where the skin</font>

214
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,819
service provider thinks what feeds this

215
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant for and so then the</font>

216
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:44,349
notification hub can say well it's

217
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,910
relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two feet I'll start</font>

218
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,269
delivering that and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who the</font>

219
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,129
subscribers are the resource your eyes

220
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,879
is what what's the resource that was

221
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:57,370
affected and then what was the operation

222
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,860
there was to create and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID name</font>

223
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:05,949
username password and emails was

224
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:07,660
modified or set the skim server

225
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:10,599
generates this and gives it to the hub

226
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,189
and then forgets about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skim</font>

227
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:19,110
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is almost like a logging</font>

228
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:21,219
function it does that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to</font>

229
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,050
figure out and it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

230
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:29,170
model your<font color="#CCCCCC"> feed so we'll have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

231
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:32,079
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in the document there</font>

232
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,969
are five models for defining a feed so

233
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,128
you can have a static feed that's more

234
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,709
like a group you just put objects in it

235
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:40,180
you could have a dynamic feed the

236
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:42,040
question I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that is what's the</font>

237
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,189
cost to the server but calculating all

238
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,139
your dynamic feeds every time so I came

239
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:48,699
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five different models for feeds</font>

240
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:53,949
and I think that's one thing we have to

241
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:56,378
talk through as a group the in this one

242
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:58,930
shows you that we could put raw data and

243
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:01,779
in the spec I've said if you feel you

244
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,959
must send raw data then it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

245
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:08,259
encrypted so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we actually send</font>

246
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,939
this is to encode it into a JWT so in

247
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:14,410
this case we would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt it</font>

248
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:16,839
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've put stuff around signing</font>

249
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,300
and encrypting to secure the message so

250
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,850
the idea is now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message it</font>

251
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,490
gets delivered to multiple subscribers

252
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,589
the hub is that really the trusted

253
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,300
entity because it has to encrypt the

254
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:31,120
message for each entity to make sure

255
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,680
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct subscriber got it so</font>

256
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,850
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to work through what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

257
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,550
of those issues and what would that look

258
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,319
at so we have all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose technology</font>

259
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,370
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so I'm proposing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just do</font>

260
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:41,079
that and that

261
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,200
gives us them the ability to push these

262
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,390
messages out / AP NSF that's what we

263
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,420
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't have to worry</font>

264
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:53,920
about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that secure as the message</font>

265
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,839
should be secured by itself it's my

266
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,180
assertion though that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times you</font>

267
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't need to send the raw data it's</font>

268
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,650
enough for many of the provisioning

269
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,689
systems to simply know the state has

270
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,209
changed this resource has been modified

271
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,670
and then the provisioning system does it

272
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,900
get if it thinks it's important does it

273
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,729
get and said tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about the current</font>

274
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:19,029
state now I'll decide what I need to do

275
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:21,400
to reconcile if you're curious there is

276
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,220
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaii presentation some</font>

277
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,199
material about how just because a modify

278
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,540
occurs in one domain doesn't mean it's

279
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,370
the same modify in the other so I went

280
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,370
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some theory on that I talked</font>

281
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,960
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little bit in the draft but</font>

282
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,570
for example it delete in one domain is

283
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,250
not necessarily a delete in the other

284
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:44,890
take for example your<font color="#CCCCCC"> its say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

285
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Salesforce and my crm role has</font>

286
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,670
disappeared so it's a delete in

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Salesforce it's not a delete in my home</font>

288
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,579
domain so that's what i mean by

289
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,660
reconciliation and why eventing is

290
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:02,350
useful next slide so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide is</font>

291
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,969
there's a JWT encoded message it's not

292
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,820
really useful here but the point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

293
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,430
that's what the speck is calling for and

294
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:15,250
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the container like slide I think</font>

295
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,420
that's it so I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend too</font>

296
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,240
much time because we didn't have that

297
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,810
much time but if anybody's read the spec

298
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,880
I can answer questions I think the

299
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:30,180
ultimate goal though is to decide do we

300
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:34,360
want this on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter going forward</font>

301
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so I propose that we take all</font>

302
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,270
of the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of short during discussions</font>

303
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what to do with the expansion</font>

304
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,350
proposal at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the world</font>

305
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,240
because you'll do you sort of see this

306
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,870
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> board before we can</font>

307
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,130
yeah but so I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

308
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand in the books unless there are</font>

309
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:56,180
people who want to ask questions I don't

310
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,739
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic there it's just because of</font>

311
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,069
the screaming is up there's some remote

312
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,250
people full verbal or so did you specify

313
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,530
the specification how you subscribe two

314
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,620
subsets of changes say there's multiple

315
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:13,280
tenants and what how do you specify who

316
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,810
has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to subscribe to what that's</font>

317
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,250
talked about in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spec although i</font>

318
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,530
don't think it's fully addressed yet

319
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,340
it's a starting point we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font>

320
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to what's the model for a feed how do</font>

321
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> define the feed one of the one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the reasons why i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's it's not a</font>

323
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,890
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to pass data is that your</font>

324
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,740
access control model becomes

325
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,830
dramatically simple if I just say John

326
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,250
Bradley record has changed I don't have

327
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,810
to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of processing about</font>

328
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,400
which fields can I tell you about and

329
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,589
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff so it makes it</font>

330
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,870
faster if I do decide to send you data

331
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,430
then I should have to check an access

332
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,500
model to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you can be told</font>

333
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,079
about that but you need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

334
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">this entity that's listening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meat has</font>

335
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,790
access to that use it right or that's

336
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,270
right problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right there yeah so</font>

337
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,150
there's two levels to it is is can this

338
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:08,720
entity know about this resource and then

339
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:11,000
can it know about what events and once

340
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,890
that's fixed then the question is can I

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,170
tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> about specific values which is</font>

342
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,240
a more detailed policy question so I

343
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,240
want the notification to be lightweight

344
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,350
and a better design than is often for

345
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,050
the like we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

346
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,950
enterprise scenario the enterprise

347
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,959
provisioning system then gets that

348
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,630
request and says oh I need to know about

349
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Phil hunts resource and when it does the</font>

350
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,100
normal get but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal skin access</font>

351
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,720
control kicks in to actually say well

352
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,540
this is what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be told about I</font>

353
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,050
think that that piece would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be important</font>

354
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,170
for something to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases definitely</font>

355
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,170
thank you

356
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:54,079
right okay except<font color="#E5E5E5"> next oh so Mort Elsa</font>

came up years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually took day I</font>

360
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:15,799
back in when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were doing skin 10 let's</font>

361
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:17,150
work out the soft delete came up as one

362
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the requirements that we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

363
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,439
deal with and and we never really even

364
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,540
though it sort of was high on on

365
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,130
everybody that implemented it or at

366
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">least a bunch of folks that implemented</font>

367
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,590
that we never really got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write it</font>

368
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:33,530
down I know various implementation have

369
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,270
addressed this in different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways and the</font>

370
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,040
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font>

371
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of French standardize it or not um</font>

372
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,668
they're really sort of two big drivers

373
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:47,030
for this one of them is essentially

374
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:49,400
referential integrity we we use sort of

375
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,740
the ID notion for references for obvious

376
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,559
reason and then once you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> record</font>

377
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,530
gets deleted then how do you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

378
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,470
which has uploaded a file<font color="#CCCCCC"> into box and</font>

379
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,049
mortiser deleted because he's no longer

380
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,150
employee of this company<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still want to</font>

381
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,830
see more Tesla's name on as the person

382
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,150
had uploaded sort of the ownership and

383
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,309
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other things</font>

384
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,440
might be transferred to somebody else or

385
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:14,240
administrator or something but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

386
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where the comments or a lot</font>

387
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,500
of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of historical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> webex sort</font>

388
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,240
of fee no recordings or somebody that

389
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,130
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know schedule the WebEx</font>

390
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,750
meeting or whatever so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

391
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,570
that referential integrity that that

392
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,750
becomes really important and then the

393
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,860
second part of it is restoration we

394
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,409
actually sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in our</font>

395
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,080
implementation we hit this with our

396
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:38,750
first very first deployment which was

397
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,668
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own IT department somebody</font>

398
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,409
accidentally went and wiped out a whole

399
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,940
bunch of record out of active directory

400
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,429
and we had a connector that was sort of

401
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,140
sending stuff to the cloud and then they

402
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,610
said oops and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they went and sort of</font>

403
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know created a new connector and</font>

404
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,110
then started creating a whole bunch of

405
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,220
new thousands and thousands of new users

406
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,439
and

407
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,780
becoming brand new users which are not

408
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,799
connected to any of existing objects so

409
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,299
everybody got new ID and oh wow sort of

410
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,918
you know you had all these like we ended

411
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,150
up going and manually fixing this so we

412
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:10,760
went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and solved this problem</font>

413
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,530
specifically for our connector but again

414
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,230
sort of a standard solution for this is

415
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,270
is is pretty important because that that

416
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">really happens in real worth and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

417
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:26,179
customers are hitting this all the time

418
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:28,429
now next um the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept is really</font>

419
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:32,510
about we want sort of all the clients

420
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:33,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that do really this is model after what</font>

421
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,908
we did with sort of a lot of the ldap

422
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,590
extends<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ldap control</font>

423
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:42,110
extension extended controls that we had

424
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,250
on in the ldap world we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want all the</font>

425
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,809
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't know anything about</font>

426
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">skim to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know continue to</font>

427
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate as skin course game specifies</font>

428
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,399
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the semantics of that</font>

429
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,960
object is really different so a client

430
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,120
that doesn't know anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> softly</font>

431
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,400
can still do a query and see all the

432
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,649
objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not deleted not soft</font>

433
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,690
deleted but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any ability</font>

434
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,059
to see a soft deleted objects unless

435
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,710
it's aware of the extension similarly if

436
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do a delete I just want to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

437
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,580
record gone so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a delete followed</font>

438
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,409
by a read I should not see that if I'm

439
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,830
not requesting for the soft deleted

440
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:17,720
options but and as a result of that I

441
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,570
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of do the classic</font>

442
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,309
I create more<font color="#CCCCCC"> teza</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I delete martez oh</font>

443
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,559
and then i create more<font color="#CCCCCC"> teza again I</font>

444
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,000
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a conflict Ba basalt of</font>

445
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,379
you know create more<font color="#CCCCCC"> teza the second</font>

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,419
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would get a new record for</font>

447
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,520
me on this I'm aware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft elite</font>

448
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,169
semantics so that's that's the basic

449
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,418
sort of semantics that we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

450
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:37,549
because a lot of clients don't care that

451
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:39,530
it's not applicable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's really</font>

452
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,510
around the administrative aspects of it

453
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,549
that that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of do this as</font>

454
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:48,730
opposed to every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tox</font>

455
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,900
skin so that that was the first one

456
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:56,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I recover the other one</font>

457
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">too next so the basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model is you have</font>

458
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,730
a snore<font color="#CCCCCC"> mille state of an object if you</font>

459
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,158
do a delete operations on it it goes

460
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,830
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a soft deleted that record still</font>

461
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,350
exists but it does not sort of play into

462
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,480
regular

463
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,168
operations of skin non sort of you know

464
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,600
soft deleted operations and it does not

465
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:17,970
affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your uniqueness criteria or any</font>

466
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,100
other sort of semantics like that you

467
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,750
can go from that state with with doing

468
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,080
an undelete and bring a tray state in

469
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:27,000
this into a regular state or you can do

470
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,649
a hard delete and potentially you could

471
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,870
do the hard delete operations as a

472
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">cleanup or sort of you know batch</font>

473
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,149
process saying so if we have a webex

474
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,379
user that that doesn't sort of you know

475
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,330
deleted their record then they sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

476
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,789
haven't logged in for six months we can

477
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,289
just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in behind the scene deleted but</font>

478
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,299
you can certainly do a heart delete

479
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:46,919
operations for a set of objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

480
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,960
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of it for</font>

481
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,730
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason privacy reasons or</font>

482
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,590
whatever other reasons that you might

483
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">have and then once it's hard to leet it</font>

484
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,699
it's gone it's it's it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

485
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,140
in the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it could be up up to</font>

486
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">this sort of the vendor or the</font>

487
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,770
implementer that it actually keeps a

488
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,289
shadow copy for our couple reasons or

489
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,429
whatnot but but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> skim semantics it's</font>

490
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:10,200
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no way of</font>

491
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:12,299
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back thanks uniqueness is</font>

492
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,030
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key part of this because</font>

493
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,950
again one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> semantic that we</font>

494
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,190
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

495
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,650
know recreate<font color="#CCCCCC"> objects and and and a</font>

496
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important part of it is the fact</font>

497
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:28,590
that a you may end up with conflict when

498
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,600
you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of try to undelete an object</font>

499
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,490
because of the fact that you allow the

500
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,439
operations to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

501
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,590
regular operations to take over that

502
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that namespace you might be</font>

503
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,039
able you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have to do delete with</font>

504
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,360
deal with sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conflict resolution on</font>

505
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,400
the way back when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you undelete the</font>

506
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,689
object<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the second part of it</font>

507
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
which which really adds a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

508
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,760
complexity is a lot of thing you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

509
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,470
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> added to that the draft doesn't</font>

510
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,240
really cover this in detail it's just

511
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,970
kind of puts a few question marks really

512
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,620
is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do things with references</font>

513
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,809
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things with group</font>

514
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,000
membership when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go and delete a user</font>

515
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,020
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go and update that you</font>

516
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,789
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of you don't necessarily</font>

517
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go as soon as you undelete a</font>

518
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,210
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was deleted go and add them to</font>

519
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,650
the group because the administrator

520
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,049
might have actually wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font>

521
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,730
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> during that process there's a lot</font>

522
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:18,570
of questions around<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to do</font>

523
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:20,460
with references and we did actually an

524
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,879
implementation of something similar to

525
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,620
this

526
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,090
what we did what we chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> was all the</font>

527
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,669
references are gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we took the</font>

528
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,649
easy route you when you read undelete an

529
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,240
object you really basically you have to

530
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and recreate all the</font>

531
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,590
references that was sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy way</font>

532
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,300
out potentially this is what we want to

533
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,429
do I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if that's that's open to</font>

534
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,200
discussion I think Active Directory does

535
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,270
very similar model they basically get

536
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,950
rid of majority of not only all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

537
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,110
references but a lot of other attributes

538
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,950
they actually delete and then sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

539
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,689
undelete you have to resupply them in

540
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,070
our in our implementation sort of in our

541
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,690
experiment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't call that</font>

542
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,179
implementation it was more of an

543
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:03,660
experiment we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get rid of</font>

544
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:05,310
the references next so the basically

545
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,200
same same question as Phil is this

546
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:10,110
something that I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a few</font>

547
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,760
vendors that are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this but</font>

548
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,649
the question is this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

549
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to sort of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know take it on</font>

550
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,920
as a broader set of work that we want to

551
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">do and then obviously the second</font>

552
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is is this something that would</font>

553
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">be interesting to their skin as a</font>

554
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,490
charter change or sort of individual

555
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:34,590
submission type of work Tony yes Tony

556
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Madeline I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> diddly I think you</font>

557
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:40,740
have a use case for we have a use case

558
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:43,379
for create and so I'm just wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

559
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,650
that shouldn't be just narrowed down to

560
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:50,610
active or not active or something else

561
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:54,990
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of specifying this as a specific</font>

562
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,429
delete we could have a state that you

563
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,260
know does that does the same

564
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,080
characteristics that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said for delete</font>

565
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:04,379
which would affect<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for create also</font>

566
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:10,710
and other states that and other things

567
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:14,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to do so yeah I'm yes</font>

568
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly uh-huh yep exactly the case that</font>

569
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,940
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pro active directory and that</font>

570
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,440
our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> want so I'm not only open</font>

571
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,120
i'm very interested in actually talking

572
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and getting a little bit more</font>

573
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,280
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understanding of the use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

574
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,169
in our implementation when we went

575
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,310
through this process we handled all the

576
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">crate because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this</font>

577
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,419
or sort of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know create but it's not</font>

578
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,010
really done whether it's not validated

579
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,800
by the administrator or by the end user

580
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,540
itself so like the classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send you an</font>

581
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">email until you click on that link i</font>

582
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,310
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually add you to the system the</font>

583
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,290
semantics of that was slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

584
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,629
and we handled<font color="#CCCCCC"> that differently but i</font>

585
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,670
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed that that is a problem as</font>

586
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,950
well whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's part of this or it's</font>

587
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,110
a separate draft or we generalize it and

588
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,420
do it for all operations I'm totally

589
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:04,229
open this is just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just threw out the</font>

590
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:08,570
idea and it's totally open to taking it

591
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,570
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is the right sort of Pat</font>

592
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:18,810
Bjorn on a stud I'm tending to agree

593
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:21,420
with Tony because in a hyper-connected

594
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:24,300
world where lots of data is move lots of

595
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,220
places we might be short-sighted in

596
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,330
thinking of delete as something special

597
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,210
because there are resources that are

598
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:37,679
created but not yet provisioned or

599
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:39,450
active but not active or existing but

600
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,180
have invoked the right to be forgotten

601
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,510
and there may be a more general case

602
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,080
here for resources that can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

603
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:50,129
different types of purposes or different

604
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,919
levels rather than going from a

605
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:56,340
two-state model you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists that not</font>

606
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,980
exist to just a three-state model exists

607
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,280
soft deleted did not exist there might

608
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,400
be need for something richer yeah I

609
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:09,440
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed with 20 so this is Barry</font>

610
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,820
it seems we're not here right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to</font>

611
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,650
hash this out we're here to see if

612
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,629
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in working on this</font>

613
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,180
it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is yes there</font>

614
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:22,070
is an interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it so let's put that</font>

615
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:26,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of right what to talk about</font>

616
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:29,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

617
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:41,799
but no no other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions so I think</font>

618
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:44,290
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beyond house hi</font>

619
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Buren on the stuff and there is actually</font>

620
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:50,860
a box here that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

621
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're saying it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a virtual but</font>

622
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:59,290
there's a literal box<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right</font>

623
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:02,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay go back one slide oh we're here to</font>

624
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:05,500
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about passwords okay skin passwords</font>

625
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,750
so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question when the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

626
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,000
adding some password or credential

627
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,070
management to skim came up my first

628
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">reaction was wait a minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't we</font>

629
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,030
like 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> too late to be thinking</font>

630
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,130
about standardizing this because aren't

631
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,799
we done with passwords and can't we just

632
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,370
forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and move on to something</font>

633
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,309
else but the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the matter is that</font>

634
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords even in a multi-factor and</font>

635
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:32,830
highly secure and tokenized world they

636
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,380
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a role to play and what we're</font>

637
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,590
finding is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies are</font>

638
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,480
trying to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> skim in ways where rather</font>

639
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just purely provisioning and</font>

640
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,630
throwing the the resource or the user

641
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,429
across the the wall or throwing them up

642
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,730
to the cloud there's actually the

643
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:54,309
identity management aspect of it so in

644
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,230
the system for<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross domain identity</font>

645
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,418
management there's the identity

646
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,610
management which involves in some cases

647
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,220
credential management at least that's

648
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:08,469
the that's the topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> for today okay next</font>

649
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:10,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though the the skim</font>

650
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Charter and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the skim scope so far has</font>

651
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:17,410
been primarily focused on provisioning

652
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:19,000
use cases we're thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

653
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,919
asking whether there's interest in

654
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,900
moving more and emphasizing more the

655
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,230
identity management and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a couple</font>

656
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,179
of reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that the use cases often</font>

657
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,510
involve managing users within the

658
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">service provider not just creating them</font>

659
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:36,490
and provisioning them and then having

660
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">them go their separate ways as two</font>

661
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,900
different entities but actually allowing

662
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,220
things

663
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:47,670
like a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> application to change a</font>

letter user change refine reset recover

their account with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider</font>

666
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:56,090
where it's not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

667
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,650
party being the service provider and the

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:02,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">identity management client they may be</font>

669
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:04,170
separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are also a number of</font>

670
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,820
use cases like ours the one that unbound

671
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:09,120
ID does<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear skins being used as</font>

672
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,189
interfaces for administrative tools and

673
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,030
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a domain where you've got</font>

674
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:17,460
large-scale end-user self-service right

675
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,139
where the user themselves the customer

676
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,930
is supposed to be maintaining their own

677
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,120
account and you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an enterprise</font>

678
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,550
or workflow or a manager an IT

679
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,850
department that's doing it for them so

680
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:32,580
self service from wherever the customer

681
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,560
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user is touching your system all</font>

682
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,409
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their identity record in</font>

683
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,700
their their skin record<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're also</font>

684
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:43,800
thinking about using skin for general

685
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,420
purpose and I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word directories</font>

686
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,370
here of people and things right we hear

687
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,740
about identity of things we have about

688
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,989
the coming era of identity at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center</font>

689
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,270
of the hub<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything and we like to</font>

690
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">have skin as that protocol and we're</font>

691
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,730
relying on it in our designs for doing

692
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,950
that so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about how do I</font>

693
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,050
provision things how do i create

694
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,460
credentials allow things to access my

695
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:12,720
data passwords come into that so anyway

696
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,930
handling credentials and passwords would

697
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,750
believe is is relevant I know Oracle has

698
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,150
similar use cases and there may be other

699
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,520
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are also interested in</font>

700
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,560
standardizing on that we've actually

701
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,090
done some work here we have some designs

702
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,800
we're going down one particular

703
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,199
architectural route for the schemas and

704
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,260
the the protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this and Oracle's</font>

705
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,640
going a different way so if this is of

706
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest then we'll try to bring those</font>

707
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,780
together take the smartest from both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

708
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,490
those as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the phrase Phil he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

709
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier so it is quoted on that that's</font>

710
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,020
the intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to take the best parts</font>

711
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:49,050
of both approaches and let the community

712
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,470
decide what we should bring into the

713
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,470
standard

714
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,928
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess there is a consideration</font>

715
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:04,559
slide here there are a number of things

716
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:07,080
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about before we decide</font>

717
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,080
voluntarily to take on this effort as a

718
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,570
standards body the multiple approaches

719
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,699
we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're also things</font>

720
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,950
to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> like representations of the</font>

721
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,450
count state<font color="#E5E5E5"> I alluded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in my my</font>

722
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,820
comment earlier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> marquez's</font>

723
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:24,450
presentation and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some</font>

724
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,939
very basic mundane things like what is

725
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,129
the exchange between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

726
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,100
application and the service provider in

727
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:34,769
terms of saying yes that password or

728
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,178
credential is strong enough right we've

729
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:38,039
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classical you've got to have</font>

730
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,710
eight characters 3 of them must you know

731
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,899
let this meet this reg ex but you may

732
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,909
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have things like the</font>

733
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:48,059
signal-to-noise ratio on a voice print

734
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:49,350
or the clarity of a thumb print scan or

735
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,408
something like that that could

736
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:55,408
eventually become part of a protocol for

737
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:58,649
a credential policy and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big one</font>

738
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:00,929
is really how do you recover an account

739
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:03,268
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most challenging use case</font>

740
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:05,190
here because at that point you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

741
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:08,669
anonymous user who wants to regain

742
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:11,549
control of something using a credential

743
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:13,109
they no longer have and if we can solve

744
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:16,440
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then I think the other things</font>

745
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:18,059
will pretty much fall into line<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

746
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,369
that involves things like closing that

747
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,399
major back door where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

748
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:25,080
account recovery mechanism is one of the

749
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,758
most common ways for hijacking an

750
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:32,359
account when you don't know its original

751
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,359
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that's it</font>

752
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:41,750
questions

753
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:46,110
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think we had one more</font>

754
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:47,880
and that's done you're you're not

<font color="#E5E5E5">presenting you're asking questions</font>

asking questions toning<font color="#CCCCCC"> adlam I think</font>

757
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:01,500
you seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be concentrated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on passwords</font>

758
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,130
a little bit maybe too much but it was

759
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,200
more focused on credentials we could

760
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:10,980
Allah there's other things coming along

761
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,780
the pipe that you know as we try to get

762
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,520
rid of passwords and if we could make

763
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">this a more generic credential thing it</font>

764
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,918
might be something that we would

765
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely be interested in as as we</font>

766
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,168
move forward yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree with you Tony</font>

767
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,480
in fact my comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my engineering</font>

768
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:31,770
team was let's not think about this in

769
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,380
terms of passwords let's call it

770
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,980
credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> right passwords have some</font>

771
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:40,620
specific attributes that make them a

772
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,418
subclass of credential and then of

773
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,310
course other subclasses of credential

774
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,370
will have their own but I definitely

775
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,440
agree with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there is some</font>

776
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,929
work going out on the w3c to do with

777
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,490
credentials also so we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

778
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,490
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie some of that work together</font>

779
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,819
thank you Tony

780
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,020
I'm gonna make<font color="#CCCCCC"> some comments and none of</font>

781
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:12,220
them should be taken as any form of

782
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:15,349
agreement with Tony John Bradley yeah

783
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,399
looking at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the point of view of</font>

784
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:22,069
credentials there are some things that

785
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,890
having looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how skin works with</font>

786
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:29,950
federated protocols specifically open ID

787
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:33,710
connect there in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases we see</font>

788
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:36,558
the identity provider or authentication

789
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:40,700
provider is not the tenant which creates

790
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,920
a interesting conceptual problem with

791
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,140
skim because everything is looked at

792
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,420
from the point of view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tenant so</font>

793
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,440
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the better what is that</font>

794
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:54,200
federated authentication assertion that

795
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,180
that the SAS is supposed to expect

796
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,669
that's going to be tied to that account

797
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,490
there isn't an obvious way of doing that

798
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:08,380
at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no password but</font>

799
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:11,419
that's just nasty so how do you map an

800
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:15,470
authentication provider credential

801
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:18,890
provider into that tenant account we're

802
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,078
also looking at you know logging<font color="#CCCCCC"> in is</font>

803
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,210
one thing there's also the whole problem

804
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,779
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you do session management how</font>

805
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,480
do you signal that for a given device

806
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:31,190
because these sasses have some people

807
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,200
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in via the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web's they have some</font>

808
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,680
people coming in through native apps etc

809
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,980
how does the enterprise through<font color="#E5E5E5"> its or</font>

810
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,730
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authentication provider signal oh</font>

811
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,180
this this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> users iphone is gone so</font>

812
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:49,190
we want all of the tokens blown away on

813
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,828
that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> device or all of their</font>

814
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:55,099
sessions terminated etc and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far I</font>

815
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:57,200
haven't found any plausible way of

816
00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:00,789
actually mapping that through skim which

817
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,558
leads us to saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm we've got to do</font>

818
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:05,510
session management outside of skim which

819
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:11,710
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of takes away from the momentum of</font>

820
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:11,710
people wanting to deploy skin so if

821
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:17,629
well if you if you were people are going

822
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:21,170
to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do session management to kill</font>

823
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:23,480
off these things sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of independent of</font>

824
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:26,060
the provisioning aspects of skin if they

825
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,500
get both for for deploying one protocol

826
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:32,259
they're more likely to do it if you're

827
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:37,190
mean SAS providers are incredibly lazy

828
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:40,000
and so unless we come up with some

829
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,619
highly motivating factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked to</font>

830
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,740
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the larger ones who recently</font>

831
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:48,470
looked at skim and said that's nasty

832
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,020
yellow not going to do that they're

833
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:53,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the largest SAS provider I</font>

834
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:58,310
don't know Mike probably got there with

835
00:37:53,869 --> 00:38:01,250
Microsoft but somebody who you know

837
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,270
it really worth the pain or could they

838
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,430
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something simpler that</font>

839
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:10,369
covers eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what they need</font>

840
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:15,080
to do so if we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font>

to come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> grips that all of the things</font>

the same way that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do single</font>

log out from from web sessions there's a

question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> can they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fit in the</font>

860
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,790
skim model and again none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

861
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be taken to agree with</font>

862
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,750
Tony I think it's a certainly a valid

863
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,160
point that you know more things covered

864
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,780
by one protocol might make it more

865
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">attractive but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they may also make it</font>

866
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">more complicated so we drew the line at</font>

867
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:20,270
authentication is not skim but keeping

868
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:22,080
track of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> credential data is part of</font>

869
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,670
the resource definition and there

870
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,590
comes under what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would want to do is</font>

871
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:30,240
ask in extension or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like it</font>

872
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,400
Phil here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to echo John's</font>

873
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,399
comments I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest to and</font>

874
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,860
potentially doing things like enabling

875
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,660
interfaces so that in addition to use ur

876
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:44,100
self service for password you could

877
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:47,460
revoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 authorizations look at the</font>

878
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:50,490
clients that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have at other things it</font>

879
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,880
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to in in some of these</font>

880
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:57,299
cases is sorting out where's the interop

881
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,460
requirement we can all build our own UI

882
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,910
and our own components to do things like

883
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,140
token revocation and things like that

884
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I think when you look at it from an</font>

885
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,240
identity management perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

886
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:12,600
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot of requests</font>

887
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:16,439
from enterprise organizations that say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

888
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,390
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to connect a management</font>

889
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,320
system in my enterprise which is paying

890
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,000
up with with your Oracle cloud and I

891
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect those to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to work</font>

892
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,640
and this is where we come back to saying

893
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,710
well okay then we need a standard I

894
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,230
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so is I mean it sort of</font>

895
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:36,570
sounds that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what everybody is saying</font>

896
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is that there there is you know</font>

897
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:41,370
perhaps literally interesting passwords

898
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,670
per se but significant interest in

899
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:47,730
various forms of or authentication

900
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,950
credentials right and it may not be just

901
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:52,590
about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know user authentication it</font>

902
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,859
could be device or session of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Education</font>

903
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:59,130
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't maybe we should eat about</font>

904
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,330
that than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so i'll just sum this up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

905
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,930
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we might have to do some</font>

906
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:05,279
words wordsmithing on the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font>

907
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I think John also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up the</font>

908
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,850
other aspect of how to map which might

909
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,089
have been missing because we didn't do

910
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:14,819
the sam'l thing how do I map a sam'l

911
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,560
credential in is there is there a key

912
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,540
that looks up other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> username or</font>

913
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,480
some other thing that that becomes the

914
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,390
mapping some people are using the

915
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:29,450
external ID which is got pros and cons

916
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:31,799
and so yeah I'm shaking my head too so

917
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:33,870
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure what the Charter would be</font>

918
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,010
but

919
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,080
should look at the whole domain of a

920
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,690
credential handling but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to leave</font>

921
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,430
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> some room to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about working</font>

922
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,280
group next step and we have called 20

923
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes right um this is quick um so</font>

924
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,660
yeah I generally agree i think the

925
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,460
missing piece is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

926
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,529
authentication policy and that's the

927
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,600
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not handled by Federation</font>

928
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:57,330
standards and it's not handled by the

929
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,890
provisioning sort of skim course Kim

930
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,660
that that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's this</font>

931
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,190
sort of the missing in between and

932
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,230
everybody's doing their own sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

933
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,090
solution for it and certainly as an

934
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,460
extension of skim it would be a nice

935
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,320
idea to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know add semantics</font>

936
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,450
to deal with that policy configuration

937
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">management how to handle sessions how to</font>

938
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,589
handle Federation's and if you do local

939
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,450
credentials how do you deal with that

940
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">credentials whether it's password or</font>

941
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,270
anything else right thank you very much

942
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:44,040
so yeah so Buchanan so we have one more

943
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:46,229
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to leave us at</font>

944
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">least like 15 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's keep it</font>

945
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,790
well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the easy one yeah good</font>

946
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so there's not a lot of meat here</font>

947
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,480
but it really is a concept and the

948
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,430
concept is if we're already modeling

949
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,260
resources that are provision resources

950
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,680
that have an identity potentially

951
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:13,070
resources that have a life cycle can be

952
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:16,100
deleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> have credentials etc perhaps</font>

953
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:19,460
there's reason to add to the core schema

954
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,730
the concept of a device a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonhuman right</font>

955
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:25,060
just like we have users and then we have

956
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:27,920
groups of users and we have a subclass

957
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,400
extension of users called an enterprise

958
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,560
user perhaps we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add something</font>

959
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,270
for devices so that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people out</font>

960
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">there who building provisioning systems</font>

961
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:42,650
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fitbit devices for automobiles for</font>

962
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,500
airplanes for power plants etc for

963
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:47,630
medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices might look at skin as a</font>

964
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,390
nice protocol for that and in fact

965
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">before skin was even came up I had a</font>

966
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:55,990
case for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large fleet</font>

967
00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:00,200
company where we had to provision trucks

968
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:04,640
trailers<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS devices drivers who were</font>

969
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:06,649
not users and locations as well so we I

970
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there is definitely an industry</font>

971
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:13,070
need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the idea would be</font>

972
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,220
to add to this model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the current</font>

973
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:18,620
model go on and add another class of

974
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,899
core resource here called a device with

975
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,240
some set of attributes to be determined

976
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then out of that there could be</font>

977
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:30,589
extensions for particular industries for

978
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:32,390
particular use cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next so more</font>

979
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,520
Tesla's put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little list together here</font>

980
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">with some input for me where a device</font>

981
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,430
would have of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course its own ID it would</font>

982
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:43,010
have a name there would be / devices

983
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:47,359
endpoint just like there is for / user /

984
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:49,730
groups today schema there and then

985
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,750
extensions in particular for that device

986
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:56,230
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the only required ones are</font>

987
00:44:53,750 --> 00:45:00,230
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top there the ID a device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> named</font>

988
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:02,450
the meta attribute of course what you

989
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:05,060
find in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> realm is that devices have</font>

990
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,669
a lot of identifiers and it varies by

00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,890

997
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:23,069
those there's also a rich world of

998
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:25,770
owners right who owns the device whose

999
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:28,020
data is collecting is being collected by

the device who's using the device right

1001
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,369
now various properties like that which

1002
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,779
we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave out of</font>

1004
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:39,630
incorporate all of that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also need to</font>

1005
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:42,599
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of device and what its</font>

1006
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,309
capabilities are now is it able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1007
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,980
two-way communication is it just

1008
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:48,480
streaming data does it have this that or

1009
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,910
the other capability maybe even

1010
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,220
potentially does it have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

1011
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:55,589
capture an authentication credential

1012
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one capability right if</font>

1013
00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:00,328
it's a scanner or an eyeball reader or

1014
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,829
something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1015
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:03,510
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would argue might be an</font>

1016
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:06,540
important type of attribute to

1017
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,549
generalize is location because not all

1018
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,279
even though not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all devices can keep</font>

1019
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:13,890
track of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS location they are</font>

1020
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,630
physical general physically they are

1021
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:18,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">located in physical space somewhere</font>

1022
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:20,549
whether statically or dynamically so

1023
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:22,470
there might be a use for a location

1024
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:26,400
attribute as part of the standard schema

1025
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:28,770
and that's I think that's it well

1026
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,099
communication devices being one specific

1027
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:35,549
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone cell phones video</font>

1028
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferencing systems to a elevator</font>

emergency buttons whatever they might be

1030
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,430
one example I think we'll leave the

1031
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">details of the example and then the same</font>

1032
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,750
discussion is we've had on the other

1033
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">three points is this something there's</font>

1034
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:53,750
general interest in working on thank you

1035
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,940
actually this one specifically anybody

1036
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:03,500
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this I mean everybody is</font>

1037
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,030
implementing something like this the

1038
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,750
question is is there value in

1039
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:11,620
standardizing the core device model and

1040
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:14,390
then potentially some of the extensions

1041
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,069
I'm sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fence I mean</font>

1042
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,980
we've implemented a whole bunch of these

1043
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,830
but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't i'm not</font>

1044
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's value in</font>

1045
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:27,740
interoperability for that level or not

1046
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:30,740
that so it it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question yeah</font>

1047
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:34,040
hold our<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we're exactly</font>

1048
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,990
that really interest in this but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1049
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,660
we would be interested in using the

1050
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:41,479
devices for authentication so tying it

1051
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,770
into this is disuse or cell phone you

1052
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,170
can use as a two-factor authentication

1053
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:47,450
mechanism and things like that I think

1054
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the biggest use case that I can</font>

1055
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:52,819
see right in our insurance so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're let</font>

1056
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,730
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ask the question so you're</font>

1057
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:58,130
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that whore device notion</font>

1058
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:00,260
but not necessarily all the derivative

1059
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,450
sort of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> owners or sort of</font>

1060
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,430
capabilities there's like standardizing

1061
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,379
any of those things well someone that

1062
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:08,750
needs to go in right to do the

1063
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,610
authentication right so okay so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1064
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,620
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in representing a device is</font>

1065
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:14,870
part of the authentication scheme right

1066
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,190
so that maybe that ties back into what

1067
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:18,799
John brought up with sort of thought

1068
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">sentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy in general we need</font>

1069
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">diaper scam and then we might need a new</font>

1070
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:29,480
endpoint for specific non-users good

1071
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:31,370
thanks Kelly hey Kelly I don't to me

1072
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,430
it's kind of outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the realm of the</font>

1073
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:36,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity management a little bit I don't</font>

1074
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:40,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I would I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1075
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,900
big problem with with with modeling and

1076
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:45,920
I think skin is good with that up

1077
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:49,420
pulling it into the core schema may be a

1078
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,490
stretch for me though um

1079
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,960
I actually disagree with you that this

1080
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,399
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside the realm of identity</font>

1081
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,450
management we see that all the time

1082
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:01,410
device ID is actually is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1083
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,549
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> as user ID for us at least I</font>

1084
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,319
certainly can speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a collaboration</font>

1085
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:07,150
side of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in IOT all</font>

1086
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:08,710
over the place but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only that we</font>

1087
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually sort of have a very desperate</font>

1088
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">need for Apple ID as well which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1089
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,130
separate conversation but but I actually

1090
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:17,140
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as identity the question is how</font>

1091
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:19,210
much value there is in standardizing

1092
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,509
some of this stuff because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you really</font>

1093
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:24,400
sort of boil it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the core essence</font>

1094
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,770
of that it comes down to a very very

1095
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,869
small set and it's like is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

1096
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:31,000
value do yet with that because a lot of

1097
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:33,040
it becomes specific to that device to

1098
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that vendor to that solution and type of</font>

1099
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,549
thing ever really that's what I'm

1100
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking with myself right it becomes</font>

1101
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:40,450
very very thin yeah but there might be

1102
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,400
value in it especially if you sort of

1103
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:45,040
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a policy around it sorry so</font>

1104
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually don't want us to keep sort of</font>

1105
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,290
drilling at this particular point

1106
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,970
because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left and I</font>

1107
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:54,099
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the conversation but next</font>

1108
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:56,470
step so so just as a leading into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1109
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:58,599
conversation is you know you may notice

1110
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:01,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we only requested one hour here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1111
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:04,299
that the reason for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because we</font>

1112
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:06,910
in Hawaii said you know if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no</font>

1113
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:09,130
extension proposals by Dallas we're not

1114
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to schedule a meeting and we</font>

1115
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have some extension proposals</font>

1116
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:15,009
you know they do exist they were but

1117
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,078
they were actually you know quite late

1118
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,839
in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and that sort of</font>

1119
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:23,200
begs the question oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're how much you</font>

1120
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,500
know is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough energy to to go</font>

1121
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,930
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> from our core documents and and</font>

1122
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,940
porch ahead with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know a lot</font>

1123
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">of extension work and is that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

1124
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,530
of work that we see before us is that

1125
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:38,260
warrant keeping the working group alive

1126
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,660
at this point right so just to put some

1127
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,609
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of framework around this I think</font>

1128
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,589
Barry will bear me out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever we</font>

1129
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:49,000
decide to do whether we decide that we

1130
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:52,450
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going it the work that</font>

1131
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,300
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done here requires recharter</font>

1132
00:50:52,450 --> 00:51:01,350
right and what Barry has told both

1133
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:04,710
mikasa is that you know we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

1134
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:07,049
support creating a spin-off working

1135
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:10,380
group words<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kim extensions without the</font>

1136
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:12,030
buff cycle and at that point there is

1137
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually very little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between</font>

1138
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the recharter process and spinning up a</font>

1139
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,740
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with you know that that's</font>

1140
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,710
basically the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so I</font>

1141
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:26,160
think what we should talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about now is</font>

1142
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:28,440
you know is there energy to work on

1143

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things is their interest is their</font>

1144
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,280
interest to do it now would meeting in

1145
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,380
Prague and Yokohama actually be a

1146
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,750
realistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> option for the working group</font>

1147
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,550
will people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to program work on this</font>

1148
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:45,360
will people come to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment work on</font>

1149
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this or do we need more time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

1150
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,780
floor is<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

1151
00:51:53,819 --> 00:52:02,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tony goblin for the majority of what was</font>

1152
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:05,279
proposed I would be in favor of working

1153
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:08,329
on them I'm not anxious to work on the

1154
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:10,979
notifications at all but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not against</font>

1155
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:14,519
the notifications as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe that</font>

1156
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:18,149
steps into territory that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just nasty</font>

1157
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:21,959
as far as that's concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

1158
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:24,569
understand why some people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

1159
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:28,319
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure totally belongs in skin but</font>

1160
00:52:24,569 --> 00:52:30,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be you know upon you</font>

1161
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,808
know be against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort if people</font>

1162
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:37,680
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it but the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones I</font>

1163
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:39,420
think are very valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to move skim</font>

1164
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,489
into a more of an operational

1165
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,499
environment than what it is today

1166
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:45,839
because these are things that are that

1167
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:53,218
are definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed and be willing and</font>

1168
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:56,219
so we'd be willing to work on it just

1169
00:52:53,219 --> 00:53:00,209
set the stage this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Barry what I had</font>

1170
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:01,680
suggested to life was that if there's if

1171
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:03,569
there's interest in energy to work on

1172
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,410
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just keep going and</font>

1173
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:10,769
get get it out that's fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps</font>

1174
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:13,649
one thing that would work would be to

1175
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:15,538
let people<font color="#E5E5E5"> go off for a while and play</font>

1176
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this in an operational environment</font>

1177
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,979
and work with each other sort of outside

1178
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:23,249
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group and figure out which</font>

1179
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:25,019
ones would really get<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and how you</font>

1180
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:27,538
wanted to do them like for instance for

1181
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:32,788
the soft delete which way you wanted to

1182
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:34,440
go whether it was different attributes

1183
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:36,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">in those states right different states</font>

1184
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,400
or whether you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a soft a</font>

1185
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:40,738
leader or whatever go off and figure

1186
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,660
that out and play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and do some</font>

1187
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:45,479
testing and then come back with a

1188
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:48,930
proposal and if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be the better</font>

1189
00:53:45,479 --> 00:53:51,149
way to do that then we might close this

1190
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:53,009
working group and create an extensions

1191
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:55,979
working group when y'all were ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1192
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:58,349
come back and do the documents or if

1193
00:53:55,979 --> 00:54:01,729
you're ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do them now till now so</font>

1194
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:01,729
that was the trade<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

1195
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:13,630
Phil here just thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1196
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:15,310
passwords I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more tests indicated</font>

1197
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,220
they've actually implemented code and

1198
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:21,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle has implemented code that</font>

1199
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:26,770
we're shipping I think others have said

1200
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:29,680
so too we do I have a draft I can

1201
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:33,009
publish as one possibility one model and

1202
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:37,450
everything I was had my eyes open today

1203
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:40,060
in the discussion today that skin is

1204
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:41,649
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to although we don't have an</font>

1205
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,320
authentication system we depend on

1206
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:47,830
authentication scheme is also the data

1207
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,870
store for credentials and there's a

1208
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:53,380
larger context to the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font>

1209
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:55,690
issue and I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get going</font>

1210
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we do have a model going but I</font>

1211
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,950
think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us a while to</font>

1212
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:01,870
sort out what is that larger security

1213
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:05,109
value that skin is providing to the

1214
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:07,150
network in terms of the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1215
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,280
providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have had the simple</font>

1216
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:13,540
questions about you know does it make

1217
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense to use HTTP to dedicate with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1218
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,380
authorization header while at the same

1219
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,790
time skin is actually the database for

1220
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication system so there's</font>

1221
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:24,480
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback concern corporate</font>

1222
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,950
architects have had about skin playing

1223
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,630
both an application and an

1224
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,009
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the system I think</font>

1225
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:34,690
the question is filled are you ready

1226
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:36,640
let's say Barry says no you guys need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1227
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:39,400
produce serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me the Brisby</font>

1228
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,160
results by viper all right are you guys

1229
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:45,370
ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 yeah i mean i'm playing</font>

1230
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,470
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on I mean yes I'm</font>

1231
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:50,140
being a little bit on the nose hair but

1232
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:55,480
you know it or we are we going to be

1233
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:57,430
like in just waiting around until the

1234
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,040
next time we can meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> North</font>

1235
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">America because then there's really no</font>

1236
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,420
point in having the working group open

1237
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:06,250
right then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be until 2017</font>

1238
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,980
until we can make physically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm right</font>

1239
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:11,320
again right or no no it doesn't matter

1240
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:13,660
right we'll keep these we keep these

1241
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,990
work documents coming out and we're

1242
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,970
going to

1243
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:20,200
hyrum up on the mailing list we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1244
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:21,520
have to meet physically right I mean

1245
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,830
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font>

1246
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,740
planning right is it well I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1247
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:28,270
how are we looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a model for all</font>

1248
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and somebody just say well this</font>

1249
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,080
is what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

1250
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:34,360
this way I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about sizes right</font>

1251
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,009
now if I work if you come say if i have

1252
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> notify drive want to talk about it</font>

1253
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,510
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people say yes it's useful</font>

1254
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,369
some say i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposed to doing it it</font>

1255
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:45,460
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's interest we could get</font>

1256
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:47,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">it done is it if i'm asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1257
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,369
milestone for a red shorter would you

1258
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:53,320
say within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next year within the next</font>

1259
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:56,310
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or within the next six months</font>

1260
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,510
I mean where are we that's the kind of

1261
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:01,420
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we should</font>

1262
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:05,080
well I think of my personal impression i

1263
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:07,420
think notify is well along and we could

1264
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:10,900
start working on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in detail and it's</font>

1265
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:12,760
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well scoped password credential</font>

1266
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,790
management we kind of opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> the door if</font>

1267
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,320
anything we didn't scope it down so

1268
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,910
that's my hesitation i'm not sure what

1269
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,200
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say because everybody said well I</font>

1270
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:21,339
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about devices and</font>

1271
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,710
everything else and that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

1272
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,030
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm just kind of like okay</font>

1273
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we're going to do this let's get</font>

1274
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,200
going on it and I'm concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1275
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:31,900
implied delay that's all right i mean we

1276
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,850
can we can also talk about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1277
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:36,340
staging and I mean we could test right

1278
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:38,080
we could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so no defiance off</font>

1279
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:41,770
till it seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fairly well along</font>

1280
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:44,350
right so let's ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barry to put those on</font>

1281
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:47,170
the Charter right now and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can</font>

1282
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete them right if we don't complete</font>

1283
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:53,619
them within the reasonable time a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1284
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:55,960
time say by significant progress by my

1285
00:57:53,619 --> 00:58:00,550
prog then we're really pulling the plug

1286
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:02,260
right that's an option too<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess so</font>

1287
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,750
independent of the Charter discussion

1288
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,310
I'm as an individual interested in

1289
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,710
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things I actually think</font>

1290
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:11,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we should continue working on them</font>

1291
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:13,390
fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not wait for sort of some</font>

1292
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:15,100
arbitrary time that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

1293
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:17,470
everybody's implementing if you don't

1294
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually come up with solutions you end</font>

1295
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,100
up with five implementations or ten

1296
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,869
implementations and bring them together

1297
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,450
is going to be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1298
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:26,920
I'd rather get them going but that could

1299
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally go in as individual</font>

1300
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,430
contribution with a bunch of us working

1301
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:33,400
together and then bringing them as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1302
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:35,078
IETF as individual contribution or sort

1303
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,970
of you know right murder or a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> word I</font>

1304
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:39,819
group that that's a possibility we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1305
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:42,669
is right turn out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two two or three</font>

1306
00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:45,369
things that seem to be like well

1307
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:48,910
developed right and I'm by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prague will</font>

1308
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:53,170
know whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is okay a reach out an</font>

1309
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:55,569
actual reach outer or re spin or a let's

1310
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:59,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">just see what happens all right Tony</font>

1311
00:58:55,569 --> 00:59:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">nedelin I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see us continue on</font>

1312
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:06,549
at least the password or credential as I

1313
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:08,200
said I'm yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about wish</font>

1314
00:59:06,549 --> 00:59:11,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prince are notified without right</font>

1315
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:14,890
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe that we should spin</font>

1316
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:17,740
down at this point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've got the</font>

1317
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:20,410
momentum i think if we spin down it's

1318
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:22,598
going to be you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lose</font>

1319
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:25,180
people and lose interest and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

1320
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:27,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's either you're concerned</font>

1321
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:30,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the the the the messaging get</font>

1322
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:32,829
around the same effort right so that's

1323
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:38,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and this keeps the messaging going</font>

1324
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the this is to be worked up sperry</font>

1325
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:45,970
thought yeah that all sounds good i like

1326
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:47,829
the approach that wave<font color="#E5E5E5"> just said no</font>

1327
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:50,410
changes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter no changes to</font>

1328
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:52,839
anything else you guys start putting out

1329
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:55,899
some proposed documents and discussing

1330
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:57,910
them and in a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see what</font>

1331
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,339
progress you've made and decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

1332
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:06,069
to recharter or not that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

1333
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:07,808
good plan miss kelly i would say from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1334
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:10,390
perspective it seems like the credential

1335
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:13,480
management has the most desire behind it

1336
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:15,720
or the broad desire behind it so if

1337
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,280
we're going to prioritize i would

1338
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,500
definitely help out and say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1339
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,640
we're going to do them<font color="#E5E5E5"> serially instead</font>

1340
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,130
of parallel that's something that we

1341
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:28,808
should attack first I mean I don't

1342
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the resource issues are there</font>

1343
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:33,640
too right there's like producing stuff

1344
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,950
and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped review and there's I</font>

1345
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,779
don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's like infinite</font>

1346
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,509
resources to get stuff produced because

1347
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,910
you guys are all pursuing your

1348
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:44,910
dividual like priorities that's cool

1349
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,859
right sure the problem is getting group

1350
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,450
the group as a whole to review all of

1351
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,370
this stuff and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're going</font>

1352
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:53,910
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prioritize right right i mean</font>

1353
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:57,540
it it as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as setting milestones and</font>

1354
01:00:53,910 --> 01:01:00,240
things right if we say let's aim for six

1355
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:03,000
months out for credential management a

1356
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,129
year out for soft elite and 18 months

1357
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,890
for notify or something like that you

1358
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">know from so we can have more concerted</font>

1359
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:13,410
efforts right but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1360
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,870
so we I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have consensus</font>

1361
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:19,680
here to everybody sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to your</font>

1362
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:21,569
individual submissions and whether we

1363
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,549
meet physically in program doesn't

1364
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:27,600
matter i think but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

1365
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:30,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prog time time scale that kinda in</font>

1366
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:33,210
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> three to four months we're</font>

1367
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decision on whether it</font>

1368
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:39,720
this stuff needs more time to develop or

1369
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:41,250
if we're just reach offering or maybe

1370
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,419
there's so much energy that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1371
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,640
change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name of the working group</font>

1372
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically this game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xed and you know</font>

1373
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:53,029
keep doing extensions robot that can be

1374
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:55,950
decided at that at a later time right

1375
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's the that feel okay for the</font>

1376
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:02,129
working here you can have more you know

1377
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:05,100
say yes or<font color="#CCCCCC"> grace your answer yeah it's</font>

1378
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:07,170
okay okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it sounds here</font>

1379
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:11,060
that there's so few for those of you who

1380
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:15,900
are listening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the wireless</font>

1381
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:17,220
yeah this is the this is clear consensus

1382
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,350
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1383
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:21,830
they're unloading their heads and I'm

1384
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:25,020
concerned this has been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> no op because</font>

1385
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:26,670
we made presentations in Hawaii we've

1386
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">made another round of presentations and</font>

1387
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:32,520
submitted drafts and i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1388
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,290
I'm going to do between now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> prague</font>

1389
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,180
now that I've got a draft submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1390
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:41,310
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on the table I think</font>

1391
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:43,290
what you need now is review and and you

1392
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:45,779
know reactions to that draft like any

1393
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,670
working group right so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1394
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,370
rights were not published for a night

1395
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,210
now so we either kill it or no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1396
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,950
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

1397
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:54,270
we're here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> right first of all there</font>

1398
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:56,580
is an important message in the room

1399
01:02:54,270 --> 01:03:00,180
right now there is interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

1400
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:02,098
expressed interest plus I'm saying as my

1401
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,169
thought was we were coming here<font color="#E5E5E5"> today to</font>

1402
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:06,030
decide on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notify whether it</font>

1403
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:08,609
would become a working draft or not and

1404
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:10,560
if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off well I'm it's</font>

1405
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">just been a bit of an oh there you can't</font>

1406
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:16,020
we can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not on our</font>

1407
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:17,790
children<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the well we can't write</font>

1408
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,339
you can't produce the document you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1409
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly discuss it and we you could</font>

1410
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:24,240
discuss it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you could discuss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

1411
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:26,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email list what I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1412
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:29,939
is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not pushing it off what I'd like</font>

1413
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:31,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see is a demonstration that people</font>

1414
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,599
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to review these documents</font>

1415
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:36,420
and discuss them on the mailing list and

1416
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,780
right then move them forward and so

1417
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,640
that's everybody everybody who's here or

1418
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:44,010
is listening is charged with doing that

1419
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,710
phil has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a document or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two whatever</font>

1420
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:49,080
other people if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have documents</font>

1421
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:51,750
make them and let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can get</font>

1422
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:54,529
some discussion of the documents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1423
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,930
we do then that gives us an answer right

1424
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:59,580
so I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the Tony Madeline I</font>

1425
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:02,399
guess that's what Phil's trying to get

1426
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:06,029
at is is if there's activity on the

1427
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:09,000
mailing list and people are interested

1428
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:11,730
is their way to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter updated</font>

1429
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,040
before Prague and that we can actually

1430
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:16,470
move except these and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them work done</font>

1431
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:19,710
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that still is concerned and my</font>

1432
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:22,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">concern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too absolutely when we're saying</font>

1433
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:27,300
but three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months we're saying</font>

1434
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:29,910
that that's by then<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if the</font>

1435
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:32,730
decision is clear in six weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

1436
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:34,890
recharter in six weeks so so I mean

1437
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:37,619
formerly I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's up to bear</font>

1438
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:39,750
it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our area director to decide</font>

1439
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:42,780
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can change our charter or not</font>

1440
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:44,580
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing what I'm hearing</font>

1441
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:46,170
very is saying here is that he's going

1442
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,180
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a judgment call based on the</font>

1443
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:53,310
activity on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list with respect to</font>

1444
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:57,140
this document right and various nodding

1445
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:57,140
his head in support of what I said so

1446
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:13,399
ok I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it yep unless anybody</font>

1447
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:13,400
has anything else yep thank you

1448
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:36,690
