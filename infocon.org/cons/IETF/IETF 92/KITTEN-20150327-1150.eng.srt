11
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,900
go through the preliminaries then we'll

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,020
go over a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group document status</font>

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,510
will cover the Kerberos pad deprecating

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,800
old Kerberos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporate encryption</font>

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:25,710
with the then and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nico's going to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">present I'd leave the remaining items on</font>

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,550
this list does there anything else you

18
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:40,500
wanted to try to cover as it is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:43,740
we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over how fast</font>

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,630
everybody speaks there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:51,419
I'm not hearing any so working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

22
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,949
status we've got a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of document</font>

23
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were approved by the iesg Cannock</font>

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,390
and GSS loop Jesus loop is still in the

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,009
RFC editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> coo hammock when it made it</font>

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,550
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be recalled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

27
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,810
the security considerations were lacking

28
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,640
had somebody try to implement it and

29
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,850
they realized that there was no

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,549
treatment for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross-realm we had</font>

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,690
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was trying to implement it</font>

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,290
someone was trying to implement it and

33
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:27,209
the there was no text still allowed

34
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:31,100
cross-realm k max to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be propagated so</font>

35
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,100
that was a bug and we have to fix it

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,140
now we believe there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a number of</font>

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,980
suggestions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list but we need</font>

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,619
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assemble those in into text</font>

39
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,959
to put into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we're</font>

40
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,830
actually soliciting volunteer I think

41
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,800
tom is as he done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ok I missed it</font>

42
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:57,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well he hasn't send it out yet</font>

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:00,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">but he's working on it we have a number</font>

44
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:04,069
of documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it through the</font>

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,018
working group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> call salzillo off i</font>

46
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document shepherd found one</font>

47
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:12,709
issue with scope that I mean it's been

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,730
brought up on the OAuth list we just

49
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:19,220
haven't heard what if that's truly the

50
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,099
recommendation yet or not yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so</font>

51
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,380
far so far everybody's been happy with

52
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,000
the proposed change and it's pretty

53
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">minor so we're probably just going to</font>

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,150
let it go through and send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on to</font>

55
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,149
Steven

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,319
so 4402 biss was also in this list this

57
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,500
is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the three bits documents that</font>

58
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,030
we last called simultaneously so far

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,150
there's been no major issues just a

60
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,150
number of editorial<font color="#CCCCCC"> nits we're looking</font>

61
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">for someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those assembled and</font>

62
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:00,439
get a new revision out hi Sean Emery

63
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,379
yeah so I think the consensus on the

64
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,659
list was that the Security section

65
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,849
security considerations section that had

66
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:14,590
the sins about the denial service attack

67
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:17,719
for long streams I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

68
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,488
pretty much consensus as far as removing

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:26,870
that statement since we believed it

70
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:31,388
wasn't a legitimate concern is that do

71
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:38,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that statement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nico okay</font>

72
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:41,270
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PRF draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbus graph there</font>

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,270
there was a sentence in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

74
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,359
considerations section that mentioned

75
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,260
that without impact integrity protection

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,770
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> views large strains long</font>

77
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,070
strings that I could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a denial</font>

78
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:04,130
service before integrity protection and

79
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:08,690
I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree that that that was not</font>

80
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:14,949
a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I i'll go</font>

81
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:17,300
ahead and yeah that goes beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> PRF yeah</font>

82
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so i think i think there's</font>

83
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,400
consensus to remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence and it</font>

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,680
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done after that are you going</font>

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to submit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new version yes as soon as</font>

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">i get access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that file great thank</font>

87
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,440
you

88
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:41,650
now we've got 60 120 6112 this the

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,950
Annette bah I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak anonymity</font>

90
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,919
sport so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is probably</font>

91
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">number three of those bits documents</font>

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,730
that went out to working group last call

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,960
simultaneously there is some edits

94
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:58,000
needed we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if a new last</font>

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,780
column need be issued that's going to

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">end on how extensive those edits are we</font>

97
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,630
are also again soliciting volunteers to

98
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:11,289
take take that work on yeah I think Sam

99
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,530
had submitted the 00 version of the 6112

100
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:18,430
is but Sam is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today so I cannot</font>

101
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,809
volunteer whom so it's unclear<font color="#CCCCCC"> if Sam</font>

102
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,550
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually submit the</font>

103
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:32,380
update or if we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody else to do</font>

104
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:35,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that any volunteers Sean Emery I could</font>

105
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,150
possibly volunteer but I can't commit a

106
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:42,179
significant amount of time until

107
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:45,190
properly end of May if that's acceptable

108
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,290
it probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have enough</font>

109
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,750
documents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last call queue that</font>

110
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,670
like we're in it we wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,820
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to last call again anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

112
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,820
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

113
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:08,670
and then finally we have a 5653<font color="#E5E5E5"> biss</font>

114
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:11,730
this is for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java binding updates and</font>

115
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:20,310
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the addition of the gsx gess</font>

116
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:21,750
exception performed purpose excuse me so

117
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,420
there were some issues raised about the

118
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:29,690
stream based methods whether output

119
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,690
error token who sent without API changes

120
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're wondering if the original authors</font>

121
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:46,560
understand the framing of the GSS token

122
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:49,830
and how you know sorry I'm tired so the

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gia GSS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java bindings were</font>

124
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,800
quite a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and it's hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

125
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,990
sense from the the mail archives in the

126
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,780
minutes about what people were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

127
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,980
thinking at the time so I guess really

128
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,710
the question is you know does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

129
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,840
the room have an opinion about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

130
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,820
binding sneak ova standing up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,179
we should hear from him my opinion is

132
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,460
that the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stream stuff should go but</font>

133
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not terribly important whether it</font>

134
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:23,340
goes or not the my<font color="#E5E5E5"> impression is not</font>

135
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:27,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original authors felt that the</font>

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">API could do all the wire encoding yeah</font>

137
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,939
for the application but rather that one

138
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,950
would create a stream out of a single

139
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,710
token and say here's a stream for you to

140
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:44,160
consume so it's sort of like like an

141
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:46,560
like an stdio stream from a from a

142
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,439
memory buffer kind of a thing or so this

143
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,880
is sort of what was thomas<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maslin was</font>

144
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,250
saying on the list yeah that's my

145
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,700
impression so it's not important if it

146
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:00,420
stays or if it goes there is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

147
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,000
one organization that actually uses self

148
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,310
framing tokens and that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSI folks</font>

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,200
they have a they have a mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

150
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:13,619
speaks TLS and because TLS is self

151
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,030
framing if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put the tokens on</font>

152
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,870
the on the wire without any additional

153
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:21,870
framing you have a GSS interface to TLS

154
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,500
right i mean the the Kerberos mechanism

155
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,880
is self raining as well no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm no I</font>

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,280
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it used the generic framing</font>

157
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,320
everywhere no no no it doesn't have a

158
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:38,970
length and and the the the asn.1 little

159
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:42,270
header with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oid that was only in all</font>

160
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,100
tokens in RFC 1964 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 41-21 we've</font>

161
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,460
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from the per message tokens</font>

162
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:55,080
so not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is present so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 41-21 is</font>

163
00:09:47,460 --> 00:10:00,570
not self framing but TLS is and so one

164
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,490
could in fact use this the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

165
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,020
thought this was intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used but</font>

166
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,000
i think it was intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used as</font>

167
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,069
here's a stream containing a single

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,470
tooth can three or produces you know

169
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,080
push a single token into this string

170
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,960
sure and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's okay but kinda</font>

171
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,240
useless yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I have a draft email</font>

172
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,650
that i haven't sent yet that I tried to

173
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,800
do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more research about the</font>

174
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,420
historical origins but it's still pretty

175
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">inconclusive so I think we're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

176
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to take it to the list and see</font>

177
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,410
what consensus we can get there

178
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:44,790
alright so now we have other documents

179
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are in our queue Brett they asct s</font>

186
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:13,888
sort of a wall on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extensions I</font>

187
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:16,980
anti-draft but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help move</font>

219
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:11,709
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more edits or if we really</font>

220
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:13,779
are ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this into the queue of</font>

221
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:18,309
documents to push forward to working

222
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:21,579
group last call yeah this came up

223
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:24,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently on one of herb dev about</font>

224
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,559
negotiation issues with negotiating

225
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,559
mechanisms that you don't know might

226
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,809
succeed and how that might affect

227
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,149
protocols where you really have to

228
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,519
succeed or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll see you have a bigger</font>

229
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:40,269
problem and it occurs to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

230
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,489
should have a mechanoid this is nikko we

231
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,079
should have a mechanism attribute for

232
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,509
indicating that this is one of those

233
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,149
mechanisms that you've no idea might

234
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:52,839
succeed because there are applications

235
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:55,899
that really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try mechanism</font>

236
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,029
that might not succeed so even if the

237
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,980
server offers it the client may not

238
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,339
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the ability to</font>

239
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,339
continue

240
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey Thank You Nico now we got a curb</font>

241
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,449
authenticator the authentication

242
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:18,420
indicator for kerberos the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

243
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,360
group version came in February it's only

244
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">four pages so it's not a big read does</font>

245
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:29,190
anybody gone through it yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> reddit got a</font>

246
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:33,079
few more hands one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is do</font>

247
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,080
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more examples into this document</font>

248
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so if those that have read it</font>

249
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,210
maybe take another think about this and

250
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,340
then we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if there's more</font>

251
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">updates needed before we see about</font>

252
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:55,110
progressing now we got just<font color="#E5E5E5"> two biss</font>

253
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,910
need to update so there's sired update

254
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,510
just respect to allow for mechanisms

255
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:04,020
that don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to do a</font>

256
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,510
mutual author channel binding there's a

257
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:10,710
number of comments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the list</font>

258
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">they haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been addressed we would</font>

259
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,880
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some help for somebody to go</font>

260
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:17,550
through the list try to find what these

261
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:25,850
are and gather them up at one time

262
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:25,849
Alexia volunteered make updates<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

263
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:43,189
okay so so like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lexi believes</font>

264
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,650
there's only three<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages there's only</font>

265
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,100
three messages on the list two of them

266
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,650
saying we need updates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nico then</font>

267
00:15:49,100 --> 00:16:02,930
suggesting also some some of those

268
00:15:51,650 --> 00:16:04,760
references so does the working groups

269
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:16,010
still want to move this move forward on

270
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:18,500
this that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore hello one time all</font>

271
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,990
right well then I guess we can look

272
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:26,180
forward to an update from Aleksei at

273
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:30,440
some point all right now we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

274
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,540
channel down flag implementations don't

275
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,660
always match respect with regard to

276
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,370
criticality there is there's currently

277
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,060
no way to incrementally upgrade an

278
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,840
application from no bindings using them

279
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,790
without a flag without a flag day

280
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,130
strapped has been expelled expired for

281
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:55,310
quite a while I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember what the</font>

282
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:56,570
date was so yeah it so is there still

283
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,829
interest in trying to move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

284
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:03,500
this so I I am interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in moving</font>

285
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:07,069
forward on this but I don't have cycles

286
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,900
for for a little while so if you're

287
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,909
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of months I can</font>

288
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,810
pick it back up well I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

289
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:17,420
the current state is is correct and so I

290
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,970
actually need some help thinking through

291
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,459
it because it's falling out of my cash

292
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,199
sure well I mean it's been a couple of

293
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,510
years so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made a couple more</font>

294
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:32,500
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is there anybody willing to</font>

295
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,500
help Nico go through that state check

296
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,170
okay yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make somebody called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idra</font>

297
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,930
in the jabber room would would like to

298
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,870
see it move forward and also can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

299
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,700
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it look up so we'll probably</font>

300
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:55,239
find each other on the jabber room and

301
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:02,910
chat that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right ID areas seem oh I</font>

302
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">always forget that so now we've got on</font>

303
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:08,830
the next up we've got to pee Cana

304
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,620
algorithm agility thus updates begin it

305
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,520
to remove structures tied to particular

306
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:19,860
algorithms in favor of negotiation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

307
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:23,290
this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> did expire in 2012 so</font>

308
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,310
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> desire to do future we do</font>

309
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,370
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's future proofing</font>

310
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,870
necessary in the feet eventually bill

311
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,850
had volunteers had volunteered to edit

312
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,830
but chairs have dropped ball and what

313
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,990
changes were actually needed I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

314
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,270
finally got in the source which took

315
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,510
some doing and then we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lost</font>

316
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,010
track of where we're going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

317
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:47,890
yeah if i remember correctly we did

318
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,180
actually give him like two changes to

319
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,060
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there was a third issue</font>

320
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:55,210
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never produced actual text for</font>

321
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:59,470
inclusion and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to pick</font>

322
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up again bill and jabber tom says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

323
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:07,420
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only one remaining</font>

324
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:10,510
change that needs to be decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um</font>

325
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,180
if we could just revive that on the list

326
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then that should be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

327
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,830
bill finish up the edits anybody that

328
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">was familiar with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can do that that</font>

329
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,340
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be greatly appreciated</font>

330
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:32,720
iono registries tom has listed some help

331
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:35,149
in verifying them but you know this has

332
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,510
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ongoing activity that's gotten a</font>

333
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,690
little stalled that we've promised to do

334
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:51,200
quite a while back quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while means</font>

335
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:54,650
like 10 years yes Sean Emery yeah

336
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,170
there's a couple people that had

337
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,980
volunteered to verify the registries<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

338
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Tom had set up one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those was</font>

339
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:11,630
Michiko I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this here from</font>

340
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:18,350
Microsoft and live a from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple I'm sure</font>

341
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:21,050
were their ads but yeah I got I got a

342
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,340
mail from Tom that says he thinks we can

343
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably get it taken care of by the</font>

344
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">next IETF meeting or maybe the one after</font>

345
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,220
that but who would like some help

346
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,850
setting up sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intermediate</font>

347
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,310
milestones so that we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

348
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,750
giant task that we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all at once</font>

349
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,780
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can break it up into smaller</font>

350
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,960
pieces so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can probably take that to</font>

351
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,960
the list

352
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,360
all right now we've got a number of

353
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:56,840
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not in the working</font>

354
00:20:48,360 --> 00:21:02,340
group the pad Triple DES triple die the

355
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:06,439
that's what yeah so so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the point</font>

356
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,439
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go into some other people here</font>

357
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:29,250
yes we could do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a mic please eco</font>

358
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,428
here Aleksei mentions the TLS unique

359
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,929
channel binding but it you know the

360
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,820
possibility that it needs to be replaced

361
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,710
but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really needs to</font>

362
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that TLS needs a session a</font>

363
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,149
cryptographic session ID which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

364
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,049
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drafts for the TLS working</font>

365
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:49,080
group does and TLS 13 will have that and

366
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:53,610
once you have that we can either use

367
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:56,010
that session hash or use the existing

368
00:21:53,610 --> 00:22:00,658
TLS unique it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in its</font>

369
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,610
specification but the hash draft takes

370
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:07,440
care of adding the missing binding

371
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:09,719
internally in TLS yeah I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying I</font>

372
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,289
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to channel sir simon</font>

373
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,220
that he thought that it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

374
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:20,279
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> standardize a different one g</font>

375
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,679
while this situation is unresolved with

376
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:27,960
you know and in case people don't

377
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:29,990
implement the session hash I don't know

378
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:35,130
how hard it would be to deploy a new

379
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:37,230
channel binding type also what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would</font>

380
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,960
have to do effectively to do it right is

381
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,789
to say you have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session hash</font>

382
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,399
extension and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

383
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:45,600
as the channel binding that's so one way

384
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:48,449
or another you're going to have to have

385
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,049
the session hash thing so if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font>

386
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,779
to to make progress without 13 TLS 123

387
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:55,609
out I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's going to happen</font>

388
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:58,009
I don't think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to sign</font>

389
00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:00,379
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for specifying and reviewing a new</font>

390
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:04,279
child binding type that works with the

391
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:06,769
older TLS is but if Sam is willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

392
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:09,889
then perhaps we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the energy going</font>

393
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:12,769
for that I just don't see it yeah I

394
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,529
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexei had been mentioned to this</font>

395
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:17,570
to be a hallway conversation and in

396
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,190
particular that there was a document

397
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,918
from Simon that was relevant for this

398
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,059
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I failed to find the</font>

399
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,729
document when I was lookin this morning

400
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:33,259
I i can send the link to the mailing

401
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:35,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">list i'll dig it out I mean Simon done</font>

402
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:39,589
the work the question whether actually

403
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:42,619
existing implementations will add api's

404
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:45,200
or waste to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the point is</font>

405
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:49,029
a bit mood because they might not have

406
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:54,080
access to the jealous unique anyway

407
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:59,469
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if for Simon you know probably</font>

408
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,468
an easy easily added two new chalice

409
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,640
well the this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend at least Simon</font>

410
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:17,160
raise it as an issue as a dependency for

411
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:21,350
the scram<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256 document he thinks that</font>

412
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,180
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel binding</font>

413
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">required channel binding which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non</font>

414
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">broken no not to be broken at least</font>

415
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:38,580
rather so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is really</font>

416
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,110
something we need to ask of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS</font>

417
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,659
working group that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

418
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,229
specify that implementations must output

419
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,730
some of these things yeah so you know

420
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,370
hopefully they'll deprecated the key

421
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:54,030
exporter or make it better and hopefully

422
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,770
they'll they'll produce the you know the

423
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:59,700
adults they'll say that implementations

424
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:03,150
must produce the channel bindings of the

425
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:07,200
various types and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we</font>

426
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,510
should ask them for so I don't know how

427
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,980
Willie<font color="#E5E5E5"> A's I guess we one of us just</font>

428
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,340
goes on the mailing list but it would be

429
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,070
nice if if we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some probably</font>

430
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,590
leave behind it slightly more official

431
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,540
if chairs you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we have helped</font>

chairs to draft a message and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,550
a less walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> curvature cheers can</font>

434
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:31,260
either post the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLS list or talk to the</font>

435
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:32,909
TLS chairs in person by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way all</font>

436
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough friday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon but you know</font>

437
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,410
that yet been a better discretion<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

438
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,700
late<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an in-person discussion but if</font>

439
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,500
if individuals are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us</font>

440
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,480
craft the message will be more than

441
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to forward it to the work TLS</font>

442
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,270
working group okay vanka<font color="#E5E5E5"> deck channeling</font>

443
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,830
bill<font color="#CCCCCC"> mills from Jala</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jabber bill says</font>

444
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,559
there's a token binding working group

445
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:56,850
that he also needs the real channel

446
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,730
bindings so yeah I think there's there's

447
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:03,169
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that need the</font>

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,170
actual session hash

449
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:28,840
okay um oh good we can't fit the entire

450
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:33,550
slides up there so I am been one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:38,830
co-chairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> simo is not here but simo had</font>

452
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:43,810
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the pad concept and</font>

453
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:46,210
you know to some extent draft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

454
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was familiar enough with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to be</font>

455
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,940
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about it so you know sort</font>

456
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:56,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> POSIX it was</font>

457
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,090
sort of a single OS instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> spec no</font>

458
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,180
talks about the local identity

459
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,730
information but the plastic standard

460
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,280
doesn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about remote systems or</font>

461
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,370
remote identity and whatnot information

462
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,899
so there's not a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to have</font>

463
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:16,629
sort of central user and group data that

464
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,210
gets distributed to all the systems that

465
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier logs into lots of places to use</font>

466
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,830
ldap for this but you know it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

467
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,290
frustrating and there's some drawbacks

468
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:29,530
to to requiring all that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that next</font>

469
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:31,889
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so this concept that we</font>

470
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:36,690
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with several years ago I think</font>

471
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:40,300
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was even involved was this</font>

472
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:43,810
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the POSIX profile in the</font>

473
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">off data in a Kerberos ticket and so</font>

474
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,340
then you know the OS if it trusted the

475
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,429
KDC would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> populate the group</font>

476
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and similar things just from</font>

477
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:58,750
the Kerberos ticket that's it is already

478
00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:00,820
using for authenticating user but course

479
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,450
you need the information to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know</font>

480
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:08,230
secure and and authenticated that the

481
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:12,250
KDC has actually issued it even if you

482
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:14,550
can only perform some of these these

483
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,170
lookups about the the authorization data

484
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,330
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the initial authentication and so</font>

485
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,660
that means that's you know that this pad

486
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,389
extra POSIX data might be coming back to

487
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the KDC from other service tickets</font>

488
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,550
multiple times and so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the</font>

489
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:32,420
hammock

490
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:35,540
container is superior to like the KDC

491
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,460
issued container for the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data so</font>

492
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,840
like basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> your people I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

493
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,520
history I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the history is that</font>

494
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,990
people started wanting the pad they

495
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,160
realized they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cam ACK and they</font>

496
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,720
start working on the cam back and we've

497
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">only just now finished the cam acts so</font>

498
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,880
we can start getting back to thinking

499
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the pad so yeah I mean usually</font>

500
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,330
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be something that you</font>

501
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,880
populate and generate at the initial

502
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,620
authentication when you get the TGT but

503
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,330
you could also do some modification if

504
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:04,729
you need to next slide so the use cases

505
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,860
for this and understanding is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font>

506
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,770
has actually had customers coming in and

507
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,360
asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of thing so there</font>

508
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,740
might be applications that can handle

509
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,340
Kerberos tickets but they don't

510
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,350
necessarily know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to the ldap</font>

511
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:23,300
server or whatever server you're using

512
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:25,159
for these these extra user data you know

513
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,919
or there could be a network topology

514
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,030
issue there could be cross Rome setups

515
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,950
they're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of similar where the</font>

516
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:39,910
relying Kerberos server just simply

517
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:42,020
cannot talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user data server</font>

518
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,000
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's in different realm I</font>

519
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,220
know that Nico I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor have been</font>

520
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,030
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these setups where you</font>

521
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,580
have like initial KDC and then you sort

522
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of send your tickets outside and you</font>

523
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,740
can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and there have been some</font>

524
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:01,820
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues relating to this case with</font>

525
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:04,400
like what initial realm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to for</font>

526
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:08,450
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> KDC requests and things like that</font>

527
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there do seem to be scenarios where</font>

528
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,410
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issue comes up and you</font>

529
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,830
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be able to talk to the</font>

530
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,110
authoritative server from the the party

531
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,990
that's receiving the Kerberos ticket

532
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:22,520
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so just sort of the the</font>

533
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,230
general sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data you would put into</font>

534
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,930
this or of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the username which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

535
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,660
not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the principal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name user</font>

536
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:32,120
ID number group ID home directory shell

537
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,960
information that's actually typo it's

538
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,350
not twenty thirty seven but 2307 which

539
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,679
is

540
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> scheme out for this sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

541
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:47,270
and you can have you the group

542
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:49,280
memberships multiple groups and sort of

543
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the origin of where the groups are</font>

544
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,899
you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have Kerberos principles from</font>

545
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,150
multiple different realms you could have

546
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,640
those consolidated into a single group

547
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:03,850
namespace<font color="#CCCCCC"> and still track you know which</font>

548
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,530
original realms are from next slide and

549
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">then there's optional yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

550
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are alternate</font>

551
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,799
usernames or identifier is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nickname</font>

552
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,210
though maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nickname is in the</font>

553
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,980
geckos I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just Ruth other</font>

554
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,600
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful but are not</font>

555
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,309
you always necessarily going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

556
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,980
present and I guess we could be flexible

557
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:31,129
so if there's a case where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

558
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:35,240
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a POSIX compliant new</font>

559
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:38,510
group server or group information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

560
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,340
could also come up with something to

561
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,289
accommodate that within the pad we would

562
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,760
not necessarily be strictly tied to the

563
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:50,059
POSIX concepts I think there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

564
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,340
slide yeah so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this old draft</font>

565
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:55,158
which is long expired which is from the

566
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:58,730
original discussions but we would

567
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:00,080
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> be modifying it we're not</font>

568
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,960
entirely sure exactly what modifications

569
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,639
those would be it would certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

570
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,100
changes to like the pros text and

571
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:12,880
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the to the protocol all data</font>

572
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:16,129
structures as well oh this is nikko so

573
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:20,470
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UID S&G ids really need to be</font>

574
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:24,049
qualified with with a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of origin</font>

575
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:26,120
and there could be multiple ones so this

576
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,190
starts looking like SIDS with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

577
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of compression and that's fine and</font>

578
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,900
it's good and the NFS people might

579
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,530
actually care<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this there's a draft</font>

580
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,390
for you know Federation for NFS before

581
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:41,510
which would it this would be very useful

582
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,860
there remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UID zingia these</font>

583
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,500
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all local to something</font>

584
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,510
they're all local so when you're dealing

585
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,280
with someone else's local you IDs in

586
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,820
you have to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of mapping</font>

587
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,740
and in many cases for one domain when I

588
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,870
one source identifier the mapping will

589
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,090
be an identity function but for others

590
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,370
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else and this exists</font>

591
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,590
in various implementations so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

592
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,270
need that source identifier and you need

593
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,760
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and especially as across realms</font>

594
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,750
and add or remove some of these group

595
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,360
memberships you need to be able to to

596
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:17,390
identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source of each of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

597
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,540
so you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the group and user ID</font>

598
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,920
numbers need a additional call face they

599
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,720
need a koala for honor they all need a

600
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolla fire but you really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font>

601
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,880
them as qualifier and then set of you

602
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDs and jetties that are local to it and</font>

603
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,000
you want to set up all of that because

604
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:37,490
and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really looks like SIDS so just</font>

605
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,320
to cover the identifier associated with

606
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:43,340
these is distinct from the kerberos

607
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,500
realm he possibly yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of</font>

608
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,230
environments tend to have multiple unix

609
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,360
domains or whatever where for one reason

610
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,400
or another they'll have diff you know

611
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,469
different assignments of the same new

612
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,580
IDs and JDS and then but they only

613
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:02,180
really have one realm and its historical

614
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,330
you have to deal but also even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> k</font>

615
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:08,389
identifier is the realm right as you

616
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:11,569
cross realms and you add group

617
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:14,149
memberships perhaps right each KDC maybe

618
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,040
add some you really are crossing

619
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:19,310
namespace boundaries if you really

620
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,168
really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this unavoidable ok</font>

621
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,060
I guess I I also fail to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

622
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:26,029
you know Microsoft has a very similar

623
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,860
concept the they do yeah sort of the

624
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:31,460
inspiration and in fact I would just use

625
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:34,090
the pack but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I would just I</font>

626
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,100
would just you know define a mapping of

627
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:42,980
POSIX identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to SIDS and then just</font>

628
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:46,569
use that yeah Sean Emery in addition to

629
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:50,600
niko just said it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> been Isis see a</font>

630
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:52,730
gssapi interface defined as well in

631
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,230
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ears going to talk</font>

632
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,230
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all right</font>

633
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:05,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think that's it for had no Steve</font>

634
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,430
bout ya on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one do I remember wrong</font>

635
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:15,650
from many years ago there was Microsoft

636
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:18,680
IPO and their way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing this yeah it</font>

637
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:22,820
is it long enough microphone you go well

638
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,370
first of all there i PR I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

639
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,820
don't know anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so I could</font>

640
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:30,740
only speculate but if the IPR is about

641
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,910
carrying this kind of data in your

642
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:37,160
tickets then you've lost already the

643
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment you want to carry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it another</font>

644
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,569
thing by the way that I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewind</font>

645
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:44,750
and mention is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this is a very nice</font>

646
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,910
network optimization for your directory

647
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,730
servers it's a very not nice network

648
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,290
optimization for everything else because

649
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,040
you're carrying these big tickets now

650
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:56,630
where they should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been smaller so</font>

651
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,240
one of the extensions that I'm proposing

652
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,050
for multiple round trips allows the

653
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,729
service to give you a smaller ticket in

654
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,400
exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your big one right it's</font>

655
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,820
kind of session resumption for TLS so

656
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're again I want that but then the</font>

657
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,160
last pessimism that's involved here is

658
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:20,750
people tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have fairly long live</font>

659
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,839
tickets all right TGT is at least and of

660
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:26,090
course oh you got added to a group that

661
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,190
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again or you know oh</font>

662
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,260
you got you got removed from a group you

663
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we need to find a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to revoke all</font>

664
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,950
your tickets so these are problems that

665
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,810
come up when you start using this this

666
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:38,240
you know carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> your authorization</font>

667
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,040
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your tickets on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

668
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are use cases where this is really</font>

669
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way right as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

670
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:49,070
there's there are services that will not

671
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:52,640
have access to ldap and so so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

672
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:56,450
need something but but yeah as far as

673
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,240
the IPR i think it's it's a lost battle

674
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:02,118
if Microsoft has IPR and they wanted to

675
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,160
extract something from from implementers

676
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,289
I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing about IPR is I</font>

677
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,788
there was something ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the</font>

678
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:09,470
past I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't remember if there was a</font>

679
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:11,869
declaration and ITF declaration about it

680
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,098
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft's but it's something that</font>

681
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,839
maybe it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing to check</font>

682
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:18,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah I mean it's definitely before</font>

683
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:22,940
my involvement so it's for implementers

684
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:26,599
to check its it's their problem okay

685
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:31,460
okay we have another presentation and I

686
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:33,829
will stay up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yes</font>

687
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:38,089
deprecating rc4 and Triple DES for

688
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:40,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">kerberos very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> named the</font>

689
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:43,490
death the draft des des des night I<font color="#E5E5E5"> died</font>

690
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:45,799
because it's fun name greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> was saying</font>

691
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,379
maybe it should have been arc for please

692
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:51,849
go away maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite so urgent</font>

693
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,970
as single des was but maybe not you know

694
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:57,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are these persistent rumors about</font>

695
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,700
RC for vulnerabilities that we don't

696
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any concrete data on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

697
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:12,200
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I guess in terms of</font>

698
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,210
motivations you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

699
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,680
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

700
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,349
at the same time if we're going to

701
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,529
deprecate things so these are both<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

702
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:25,970
guess these are the last non<font color="#CCCCCC"> cfx and</font>

703
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:28,670
types for the GSS mechanisms so with

704
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,529
these these are old ones you do not get

705
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:34,190
acceptor subkeys<font color="#E5E5E5"> except your sub keys</font>

706
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:37,910
are useful for avoiding replay caches in

707
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:42,019
some situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lets us almost</font>

708
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:45,920
get rid of 1964 there's just a handful

709
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:49,910
of things left in 1964 other than these

710
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,680
egg types these are the only two egg

711
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,899
types that we have context deletion

712
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">tokens specified for everywhere else</font>

713
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,130
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an empty message</font>

714
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,230
ignore the bullet point about GSS

channel bindings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was confused when i</font>

716
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,789
was reading the slides but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in</font>

717
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,740
some sense they're both starting to get

718
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:09,299
weak and our experience getting rid of

719
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,890
single deaths has shown us that it

720
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:13,019
really does take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time to get</font>

721
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,788
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop using these things so we</font>

722
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:22,200
should start soon maybe we should

723
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:24,059
started five years ago yes it's an

724
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,939
implementation issue but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

725
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:31,019
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidance to people that you know</font>

726
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:33,240
they should stop doing these things next

00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:35,098
slide or showing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know say somehow we</font>

728
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,970
have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting things like for</font>

729
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:44,630
windows 2003 compatibility mode in which

730
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:48,328
it uses the our 4-h<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aes keys</font>

731
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:53,930
for instance as as opposed to so you

732
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:59,579
have a new server and a 2003 compatible

733
00:39:53,930 --> 00:40:03,180
realm so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

734
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:06,509
been explored but as far as the security

735
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:09,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">properties but it's good to get a really</font>

736
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:11,400
long time for yeah some of those domains

737
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,230
to migrate through i guess i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font>

738
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,660
i understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris are they just taking</font>

739
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:18,630
the actual key material from the aes

keas and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they are 4-h mac</font>

741
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:26,430
i do not realize that that's interesting

742
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out right so</font>

743
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,779
I guess tying very closely into that one

744
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,980
of the reasons to get rid of our c4 is

745
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:34,049
that the string the key function is

746
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,730
really really bad so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not using</font>

747
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:40,230
our c4 estrena key function in that

748
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:42,059
Sarah scenario that's interested so

749
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,670
Chris the string the key function is

750
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,380
unsalted md4 so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

751
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,799
rainbow table for all users in all

752
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,440
realms and you can populate that rainbow

753
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:54,599
table very quickly then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

754
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,480
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rc4 key stream via biases</font>

755
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,819
that we're hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in TLS land</font>

756
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,130
quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> news recently Kenny's</font>

757
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the room and you again there's these</font>

758
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,109
possible other attacks against the

759
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,779
cipher that

760
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:12,029
I personally don't know anything about

761
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:14,880
but the real really big issue for our c4

762
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:17,249
is the cross protocol issue because the

763
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,299
the whole point of the rc4<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kerberos ink</font>

764
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:23,038
type was that the windows systems could

765
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:25,920
transparently migrate to using Kerberos

766
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:29,039
instead of ntlm and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that</font>

767
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:34,109
the existing NT password hash was used

768
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:35,910
directly as the Kerberos key and so

769
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:39,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why the lack of the salt came</font>

770
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:44,598
into play and the sort of funky unicode

771
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:47,130
stuff and so with the anti password hash

772
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently there are some some ways some</font>

773
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,259
scenarios in which an application server

774
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:55,589
ends up with anti password hash if it's

775
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:57,210
doing aunty LM protocol and then it

776
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:59,849
happens to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Kerberos key as well</font>

777
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,440
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really nasty cross protocol</font>

778
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,900
attack I do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the details of that</font>

779
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,180
if you do know scenarios in which that

780
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,069
happens please pipe up I would love to

781
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:12,390
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and have more text in the</font>

00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,819
varsity<font color="#CCCCCC"> four is going to be hard because</font>

it's in some of these old<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

now but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other sort of related issue</font>

790
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,730
with these windows systems if you have

cross Rome trusts that were generated

talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> related issues later on</font>

798
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,559
and they're probably other reasons why

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of it will card I don't know</font>

800
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:59,269
what they are right now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font>

801
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,269
hear more and flush out the draft Oh

802
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:05,970
so the moving on to Triple DES Triple

803
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:08,190
DES is not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> as bad as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4 again the</font>

804
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:10,770
main a big concern here is the string

805
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:17,730
the key function which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just unfold</font>

806
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:20,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fold is is pretty lousy I yeah</font>

807
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:23,520
in folders pretty much the block size

808
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,279
again being does based in 64 bits so you

809
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,920
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get cipher block collisions you</font>

810
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,109
with the birthday attack after to the 32

811
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,079
encryptions some people might worry

812
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:36,240
about that some people might not the

813
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,520
ciphertext collision would just be

814
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,868
revealing like a couple blocks of

815
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,180
plaintext it would not be a full

816
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:44,970
compromise which you would get you know

817
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:48,450
with some of the AED modes if you reuse

818
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:51,209
an oz so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too bad Triple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DES is</font>

819
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:54,200
also of course very slow but those are

820
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:57,000
so the main complaints and so if I'm

821
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,129
expecting any pushback on this proposal

822
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,920
I'm sort of expecting here because you

823
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,480
know Triple DES is perhaps not super bad

824
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,849
so maybe we don't need to start

825
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,960
deprecating it right now I personally

826
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:08,280
still think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should start the</font>

827
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,369
process because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to take a</font>

828
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:15,420
while but you know I'm happy to hear

829
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:17,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">from people who think otherwise because</font>

830
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,200
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft never implemented air</font>

831
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:21,630
ball<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft Ripton implementation of</font>

832
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,098
Triple DES as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know so we're</font>

833
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking just the UNIX</font>

834
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,030
implementations and if you're deploying

835
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,770
anything new it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do</font>

836
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:33,359
a s as well as Triple DES the next slide

837
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,980
so yeah that's all I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got for the</font>

838
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,000
presentation does anybody have any

839
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:40,819
thoughts they want to share additional

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,700
attacks complaints about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposal</font>

841
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:46,200
Kenny Patterson and asking a question

842
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,848
from a point of ignorance rather than

843
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">being informed are the keys that you're</font>

844
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,630
using in these algorithms full strength

845
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:55,109
through entropy keys or are they derived

846
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:58,589
from user passwords they can be both so

847
00:44:55,109 --> 00:45:01,740
the Kerberos protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> and well I guess</font>

848
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:03,630
the encryption type profile requires you

849
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,149
to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a string to key function for</font>

850
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,549
generating keys from passwords and also

851
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,240
a random<font color="#CCCCCC"> to key function or just turning</font>

852
00:45:08,549 --> 00:45:15,200
random data into

853
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,640
I think for well feel our seafaring type

854
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,680
the random takia is just the identity

855
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,400
function but the string dequeue function

856
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,558
does take a password input right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

857
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,650
if your keys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not full strength keys</font>

858
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:32,180
then biases<font color="#CCCCCC"> and our c4 or the least of</font>

859
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:35,089
your worries because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just do an</font>

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,839
acute a dictionary attack right as you

861
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:42,009
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I guess an addiction soul okay</font>

862
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:45,319
so yeah rainbow tables right so yeah I

863
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:46,670
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate to say it but then I think</font>

864
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:49,910
getting rid of our c4 is not your

865
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:52,069
priority getting real diversity for now

866
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,690
is not the priority you know get it

867
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:55,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting rid of a protocol it relies on</font>

868
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:58,760
user passwords as the source of all keys

869
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:59,780
is probably your priority a particular

870
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,369
one that's vulnerable to dictionary

871
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,559
attacks right you want a pake based

872
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:06,849
thing if you want to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

873
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:11,119
right and we'll hear about that later

874
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:15,049
shot and we do have mechanisms for PK

875
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,359
nets and fast that protect users

876
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:19,670
passwords yeah but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font>

877
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,598
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to deploy fast or pique</font>

878
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:29,210
knit on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that only speaks rc4</font>

879
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:31,549
well maybe we can I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

880
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:35,859
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is it for the Ben show and</font>

881
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:35,859
it's time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Neko show so</font>

882
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:57,050
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this i'm not sure what the</font>

883
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:58,940
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of it is right so bill now</font>

884
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,590
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suspect that this will end up</font>

885
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,500
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven by things like pci and</font>

886
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:05,660
other business security standards which

887
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,970
would kill the older OS versions and

888
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:13,430
compliant environments compliant in

889
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:15,379
quotes so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess PCI compliance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may at</font>

890
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,049
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point require not using these old</font>

891
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:24,730
systems and then they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away which</font>

892
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:24,730
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice you go</font>

893
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:39,160
right so so there's there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of</font>

894
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:41,619
things that I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have done</font>

895
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:45,700
this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll probably do</font>

896
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:47,559
some implementations soonish the idea

897
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:52,390
here is that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be able to</font>

898
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:55,269
do fast crypto in GSS applications we

899
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,700
have some applications that you know for

900
00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:59,919
example can see it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

901
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:03,759
rubberized net cattle it's really GSS

902
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,369
ified madcap and it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font>

903
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:11,259
speak for message tokens as fast as

904
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:13,239
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right now the crypto is is</font>

905
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:18,670
the limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

906
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:22,180
and so we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some ocv or GCM or</font>

907
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,499
one of those aad cipher modes and we've

908
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">had this discussion many times in the</font>

909
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:29,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">context of Kerberos and it basically all</font>

910
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:33,538
comes down to 44 Kerberos itself it's a

911
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:37,180
no-go because of of the use of long-term

912
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:40,559
keys where we can really provide enough

913
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:44,529
assurances as to IV non<font color="#CCCCCC"> reuse and</font>

914
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:48,789
generally I be reused for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Dieng</font>

915
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:50,529
types is fatal to security so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

916
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:56,410
places where we can really use these the

917
00:48:50,529 --> 00:49:00,729
cipher modes is in session key context

918
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:03,249
or we're using a session key and the

919
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:06,218
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is GSS there aren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

920
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:09,899
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kuro supplications not very many</font>

921
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:13,630
that use the curve<font color="#CCCCCC"> prive and curved safe</font>

922
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:15,009
messages PD use so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need</font>

923
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,920
this for kerberos in general we only

924
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:21,190
really need it for GSS this fits

925
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,469
perfectly into<font color="#CCCCCC"> 41-21 it's a very small</font>

926
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:26,410
modification the only question really

927
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:28,390
for me is should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we share an n-type</font>

928
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:32,129
namespace where should we define another

929
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:34,520
type negotiation payload for for GSS

930
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,460
right and

931
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:43,710
and this is a bit tricky here because of

932
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:46,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way egg type selection is is handled</font>

933
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,780
in the egg type negotiation really it's

934
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,880
the server sending back a nap<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap</font>

935
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,470
encrypted in the egg type that that it

936
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,690
shows from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> egg tech negotiation</font>

937
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,390
payload so obviously there would be some

938
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:00,450
impact on Kerberos but anyways that's

939
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:02,580
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean just in turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Benkei doc just</font>

940
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,710
in terms of the n-type namespace

941
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,230
registry there's already a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> egg</font>

942
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,020
types in there which are not which have

943
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:12,060
very serious limitations on what context

944
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,560
to Allah<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use them in right yeah I</font>

945
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,140
guess maybe some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

946
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,420
mistake but I haven't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

947
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,730
being able strong use the existing egg

948
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:24,180
type namespace is<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient it's just a</font>

949
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">little less work to do we would still</font>

950
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,940
need a new app track message<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rex are a</font>

951
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:32,340
prep message with a new field or or

952
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,740
accessibility or something by which the

953
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,820
server can indicate that yeah this is

954
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,330
the egg type we're going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

955
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:41,550
sure but it's it's it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

956
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:43,080
no-brainer either way so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

957
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,970
one question I have before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font>

958
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:50,210
start implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what what do</font>

959
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:50,209
people want ask for ID number space

960
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:58,080
there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the possibility that you</font>

961
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:58,080
know will later want to actually add

962
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:09,400
ways to use these these aad<font color="#CCCCCC"> egg types in</font>

963
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:12,490
Kerberos with additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> IV derivations</font>

964
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:16,390
from other random or whatever for for

965
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:21,368
kerberos PD use non session EP use we'll

966
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:23,890
see I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care next line and so</font>

967
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of the same thing so next</font>

968
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:31,960
slide the next thing is Kerberos is a

969
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:35,410
one round-trip protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> or really a half</font>

970
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:37,480
round trip and a one-run trip and it

971
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:40,180
doesn't handle error recovery very well

972
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,280
at all so if you your ticket your

973
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:45,640
service ticket is just expired or not

974
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:49,090
valid yet or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have skew clock skew</font>

975
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:52,180
issues or any number of things this

976
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:55,270
perhaps the server got rekeyed perhaps

977
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:57,160
yeah yeah any any number of issues like

978
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:59,530
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server basically will send you</font>

979
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,170
an error back and you're done and if

980
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:04,480
you're if you're doing this in and a

981
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,670
protocol like<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jesús key</font>

982
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,950
exchange where failure of the key

983
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:13,119
exchange is fatal the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection dies</font>

984
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:15,220
right and then the user has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rerun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

985
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,910
command or whatever it's it's very

986
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:21,490
painful so the thing we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

987
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:24,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have automatic recovery from some of</font>

988
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:27,069
these cases where the client says hey by

989
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,130
the way I can also handle more on trips

990
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,450
and the server can say if there's an

991
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:34,000
error is sort of can send back to curb

992
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,830
error with an indicator that I've

993
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,220
returned<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue needed to the service</font>

994
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:42,700
application and if you can recover you

995
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:45,419
can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me another context token with</font>

996
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:49,290
the new ticket the new whatever and

997
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:53,309
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> authenticator and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go right so</font>

998
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:56,549
there's a draft for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font>

999
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:59,910
it's got most of think it's close to to

1000
00:52:56,549 --> 00:53:07,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I think hopefully it won't take</font>

1001
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:13,529
a lot of work to review and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1002
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:15,390
see it adopted or else<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shep hurted but</font>

1003
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:20,069
this is this is very desirable in some

1004
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:21,808
environments so yeah I think I've

1005
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:23,819
described in the story there's also the

1006
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:26,280
our cash avoidance it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also gets your</font>

1007
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:28,170
user to user right you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a ticket</font>

1008
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,150
or even if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1009
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:32,339
ticket you got the the KDC told you oh

1010
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,530
this guy can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do use your user while</font>

1011
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:38,369
you send a bogus initial context token

1012
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:40,410
the service says hi you can do multiple

1013
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:42,720
round trips and here's my TGT that you

1014
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:46,170
need to use for forgetting a user<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1015
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,828
user bingo you got user user this also

1016
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:52,290
handles our cash avoidance in some ways

1017
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:55,349
you you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to make sure that</font>

1018
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the initial context token can't be</font>

1019
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:59,730
replayed against some other service

1020
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:04,680
that's also using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same long-term</font>

1021
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:09,270
keys but but other than that this

1022
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:11,730
handles on replay cash avoidance replay

1023
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:14,960
caches are really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to get</font>

1024
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:18,150
right and in a clustered environment

1025
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,940
extremely difficult to get right some of

1026
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,440
the stuff I've seen on<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0r Kiki data and</font>

1027
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,690
the TLS working group has me very

1028
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,849
concerned because you know Kerberos has

1029
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,309
been trying to use a replay cash for

1030
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:30,660
decades and it's not really none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1031
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:34,890
implementations have really gotten it

1032
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:39,920
right yeah to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that respect Shanna Marie</font>

1033
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:42,509
I think this yeah would be very helpful

1034
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,400
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1035
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,829
applications the services are moving

1036
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:51,900
away from you know shared shared

1037
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:56,520
services luckily there's you know a few

1038
00:54:51,900 --> 00:55:00,599
windows 2000 clients around there but in

1039
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:03,809
case I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a issue a major</font>

1040
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:08,700
issue that we find and usually the void

1041
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:10,970
ensuite play cash corruption is you know

1042
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:14,460
just to put a lock around the acceptor

1043
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:17,009
which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> only kills performance you know</font>

1044
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,260
we did you know a while back I did some

1045
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,210
work on avoiding you know the need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> F</font>

1046
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,130
sinks and so on and that improved our

1047
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,660
cache performance greatly but there were

1048
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:27,960
still many ways in which they are cash

1049
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:30,299
in the standard solaris sorry Kerberos

1050
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,240
implementations out there are just no

1051
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:36,660
good right the our caches are are just

1052
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:39,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">really really hard to get right so we</font>

1053
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,509
need to do this fortunately for a lot of

1054
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,650
applications it's kind of a non-issue

1055
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:45,329
all the applications where the client

1056
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:49,230
says the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> per message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> token if</font>

1057
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:51,030
you're using newegg types RFC 41 to the

1058
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:54,180
one in times it just works out if you

1059
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:57,150
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour cash but it's an</font>

1060
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:59,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">accident right so it's a happy accident</font>

1061
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:04,440
we should we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1062
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:06,599
it the cases where we know that this is

1063
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,380
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay like there are no</font>

1064
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:13,619
non-accidental happiness cases then we

1065
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:18,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need additional round trips but</font>

1066
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways next slide then there's PK cross</font>

1067
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:24,119
manual cross-realm rekeying keying is

1068
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,980
terrible some implementations don't even

1069
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:33,109
have multiple key sets for<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle and</font>

1070
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:36,030
manual cross from key role over

1071
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:38,520
necessarily results in breakage and so

1072
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:41,700
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to turn your ticket lifetimes</font>

1073
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:44,280
down a lot to try to avoid that that

1074
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,290
this doesn't solve that but it but still

1075
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,559
it's a manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> process the operators</font>

1076
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:50,940
learn the keys it doesn't scale it's

1077
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,569
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the biggest problems with</font>

1078
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:58,170
kerberos scalability next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide and so</font>

1079
00:56:54,569 --> 00:57:00,630
the rough idea is basically get a get a

1080
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:02,050
certificate for your from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font>

1081
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,369
realm

1082
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">ouching for your identity and then you</font>

1083
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:13,160
go dhoop ek in it at a remote realm so

1084
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,750
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really PK in it anymore and if</font>

1085
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,299
you add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of Dane we can</font>

1086
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:22,850
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that build peek across that</font>

1087
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:25,369
scales you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> web scale yeah there's</font>

1088
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:29,650
I'll go back for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit there is there's</font>

1089
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:33,140
ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a percent to persist such a</font>

1090
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:37,640
peek across key cross-realm trust

1091
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:40,700
there's ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it where you the keys</font>

1092
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,470
are ephemeral right and there's ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1093
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,089
do it where the clients do all the work

1094
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,379
and there's ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it where the TGS</font>

1095
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:49,000
is do all the work for clients that

1096
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:52,160
don't support it has some privacy

1097
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:56,210
features that are desirable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

1098
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,830
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good next and then there's name</font>

1099
00:57:56,210 --> 00:58:00,820
attributes there's there's a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1100
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:03,230
name attributes that we'd like to have

1101
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:06,410
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them can be generic there are</font>

1102
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:08,570
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the pier you know your</font>

1103
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:10,279
peers a host based service and here's

1104
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:13,540
the service and here's a hostname and

1105
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:19,670
this is the issuer the issuer could be a

1106
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:23,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">CA name x-p kicks name or it could be a</font>

1107
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:26,230
Kerberos realm or it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> any number</font>

1108
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:28,970
of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things trust validation path</font>

1109
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:31,970
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety of things</font>

1110
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:35,689
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available for users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

1111
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:39,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">user name and local names local username</font>

1112
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and so on is there another slide</font>

1113
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:44,450
that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other things that</font>

1114
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:46,850
I didn't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this slide are the the</font>

1115
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:49,279
impersonation attribute which is a way

1116
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:52,759
of saying i'm using this<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk Kerberos</font>

1117
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,380
principle that really has no known no

1118
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,490
access to any no authorization to

1119
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:00,500
anything except<font color="#CCCCCC"> two other two small</font>

1120
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:03,020
number of other services<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those</font>

1121
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,380
services it can impersonate anybody

1122
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:09,350
right this is for middleware so it's so

1123
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:11,010
no need for financial delegation no need

1124
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:13,740
even for<font color="#CCCCCC"> constraint credential delhi</font>

1125
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:16,770
because as for you has issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross</font>

1126
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:19,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">realm you can't loop back to your home</font>

1127
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:22,340
realm and in some environments that's a

1128
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,980
problem with this impersonation

1129
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:28,140
attribute when when a middleware thing

1130
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:31,340
wants to impersonate someone to someone

1131
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:33,629
else it just basically acquires a

1132
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,640
credential for itself but with this

1133
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:37,440
impersonation attribute for its name

1134
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,680
saying I'm impersonating this other

1135
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,770
person and this works safely because if

1136
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,899
the service is trying to impersonate to

1137
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:48,360
doesn't understand this it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1138
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,890
to see the middleware<font color="#CCCCCC"> principal name</font>

1139
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,050
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really authorized to</font>

1140
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,520
anything if it does understand it it's

1141
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:56,550
going to extract the attribute set oh

1142
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,620
you're impersonating<font color="#CCCCCC"> Niko and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1143
00:59:56,550 --> 01:00:00,120
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to check that you are</font>

1144
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,740
authorized to do this and there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1145
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:05,480
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very lightweight</font>

1146
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:08,759
impersonation very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightweight</font>

1147
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:12,480
credential delegation if you like no no

1148
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:14,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">credential evaluation and then there's</font>

1149
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,190
the pad stuff right accessing access to

1150
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,560
to come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> payloads the Cadillac</font>

1151
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:21,930
accesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> to parts of the pad those are</font>

1152
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:26,190
no longer generic but we need to

1153
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:28,080
actually do that too and actually they

1154
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,390
would be generic in some sense right

1155
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,920
just because it's only Kerberos carrying

1156
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:35,940
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make them Kerberos</font>

1157
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,860
specific so that's that's it for me if

1158
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,170
there's any interest on any of these

1159
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:43,530
things some of these will definitely

1160
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:46,530
move ahead on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GSS ink types almost</font>

1161
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:49,230
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> will implement and we'd like</font>

1162
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:52,410
either sep hurting or or making this a

1163
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:57,810
work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pile yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean been here</font>

1164
01:00:52,410 --> 01:01:00,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">just with the the pad and the naming</font>

1165
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:03,210
attributes i mean the pad is the POSIX

1166
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,970
authorization data and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty</font>

1167
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:08,510
generic so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would fall under</font>

1168
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:08,509
generic

1169
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:17,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we should pull up the other</font>

1170
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:20,308
slides yeah so then there's this

1171
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:22,410
McCallum kitten curb service discovery

1172
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,789
we had some discussion on them on the

1173
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:28,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">list about this this is sort of like a</font>

1174
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:31,680
new year I scheme for using dns lookups

1175
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:35,880
to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerberos Casey's and similar</font>

1176
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,828
services to potentially replace the

1177
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,709
existing serve records and reduce the

1178
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:42,390
number of DNS queries you need so I

1179
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:45,509
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hopefully people have</font>

1180
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:47,269
been following lists and unseen this I

1181
01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:49,440
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check if anyone had</font>

1182
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:56,538
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to make at the mic</font>

1183
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:56,539
about it I'm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> support of this draft</font>

1184
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I think the next slide is on the</font>

1185
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:09,520
kitten impersonation naming a true which

1186
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:13,070
was Niko's thing but you covered it yeah

1187
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,950
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so before we get to open mic can we</font>

1188
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:19,370
go back up to the summary slide with the

1189
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:24,490
list of documents yeah so we've got all

1190
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:27,770
these documents there's eight items here

1191
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:29,600
that's a lot of things not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very many</font>

1192
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:31,520
people not very many different people

1193
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:37,640
have been getting up to the mic to talk

1194
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:38,930
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so you know we would want to</font>

1195
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,609
get some sense of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

1196
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,890
actually read or understand the

1197
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:45,200
different documents and then after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1198
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:47,180
we can try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a sense of you know</font>

1199
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,819
how much support there is for adopting

1200
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:52,190
the different documents so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a couple</font>

1201
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:55,100
of things with the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GSS</font>

1202
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:57,290
extensions I Anna registry perhaps we

1203
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,089
can drop two of these right the the

1204
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:00,590
generic naming attributes and the

1205
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:03,410
impersonation of naming attributes

1206
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:08,810
perhaps that should all just be expert

1207
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:12,440
reviewed registrations and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1208
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:14,060
go straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iono perhaps I mean I</font>

1209
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,220
think some of those might be

1210
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:20,240
sufficiently important that we do want

1211
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:22,970
the higher level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of review perhaps it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1212
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry but if there's a question of load</font>

1213
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:29,930
I think we should we you know we could

1214
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">always go that way the others I don't</font>

1215
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:39,080
think have any any lightweight approach

1216
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:40,669
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> either adopt a more sure so I'm</font>

1217
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,770
just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down the list and ask</font>

1218
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:44,300
for like a show of hands who has read

1219
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:47,320
the different documents or he was

1220
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,320
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font>

1221
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">first yeah yeah so we're just gonna go</font>

1222
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,690
through all them asking who's read or

1223
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:05,160
yours familiar so who has read the pad

1224
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:09,330
or thinks they know what it is for

1225
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:14,250
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has read the des des des die</font>

1226
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:19,400
die die a few more who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has read the</font>

1227
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:22,860
group five extra round trip just to you

1228
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:27,800
the GSS only ink types i think was just

1229
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nico's mail but who read that mail</font>

1230
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:43,320
slight slightly fewer the PK cross

1231
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:48,750
proposal who read that the generic

1232
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:51,270
naming attributes who read that we're

1233
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:58,380
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the same handful of people</font>

1234
01:04:51,270 --> 01:05:02,009
here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chorus the Kouros service</font>

1235
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:05,430
discovery i read that i read that

1236
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:08,640
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not sure that again two to</font>

1237
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:12,600
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> people the impersonation naming</font>

1238
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:15,509
attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I who read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but just two</font>

1239
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:19,500
people I didn't read that and who is

1240
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:24,300
here just reading their email that's

1241
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:27,030
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought there we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font>

1242
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,800
think it's premature for us to try to

1243
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:30,990
make any calls for adopting anything

1244
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:35,640
just yet but we could take this to the

1245
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:37,410
list I mean it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> on its it's</font>

1246
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really a good idea to try to adopt</font>

1247
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:44,960
things that nobody's actually put that

1248
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:44,960
but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing</font>

1249
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:58,750
but that's true so sure I think we're

1250
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:58,750
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from our illustrious ad oh</font>

1251
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:07,879
yeah I Sean Emery I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

1252
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:09,190
few of these adopted maybe not all or I

1253
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:13,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if we have enough energy to</font>

1254
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:16,310
take all these on in the past it's been

1255
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:20,210
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> energy to</font>

1256
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:24,500
review all these sufficiently so just a

1257
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:28,040
warning or caveat on that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1258
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:30,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pad pad draft speaking as an</font>

1259
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,130
individual of course since like I'm

1260
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:37,220
Conda in a quasi-state of<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-chair and</font>

1261
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:43,490
individual contributor the Triple DES

1262
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:46,790
die die die I think is important extra

1263
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:52,490
round trip is also important it solves a

1264
01:06:46,790 --> 01:07:01,840
number of real real world issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> pic</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">across I'm not as much you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

1266
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:12,280
demand for but maybe I should boots<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1267
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:14,720
think is also important as well that we

1268
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,910
need some standards yeah I mean I think

1269
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:19,129
maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should try and have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thread on</font>

1270
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list to ask you know we've got all</font>

1271
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:23,690
these potential topics which ones are

1272
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:25,549
people more interested in which ones are

1273
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:27,230
less interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do we have</font>

1274
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:30,260
enough energy to go forward with some of

1275
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:33,110
these and which ones Steve but yes I but

1276
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,730
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got up to suggest is maybe means you</font>

1277
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,630
mean it you know the energy level in

1278
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,310
this working group has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> my ongoing</font>

1279
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:39,410
thing but still people keep managing to

1280
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:41,120
do good<font color="#E5E5E5"> work just not at a tremendously</font>

1281
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:44,089
high pace but that's that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i</font>

1282
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:46,190
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would suggest maybe it not just</font>

1283
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:48,020
asking who's interested but you try and

1284
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:49,970
prioritize them i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean some solemn yeah</font>

1285
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was intending to say prioritization</font>

1286
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:54,080
and i think i fail to see that yeah

1287
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,200
because because i obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nico's</font>

1288
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,700
interested in

1289
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,439
and everything so that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but no even</font>

1290
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might think that some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

1291
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,270
higher priority than others<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I do I</font>

1292
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:07,319
mean I do think that at least three

1293
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:13,960
items here can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be iono kinds of things</font>

1294
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:16,270
the pad III<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would I would I would I</font>

1295
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,720
would volunteer to review the pad as an

1296
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">expert and I there wasn't this he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1297
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">minus over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I know well he's</font>

1298
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:27,969
asking me<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I if I would be the the</font>

1299
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:29,500
expert and the registrant right well the

1300
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,569
expert reviewer for the registry right

1301
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:35,350
yeah which well for my own registrations

1302
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:36,549
which is probably not good no so we'd

1303
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:38,200
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find someone else to be a</font>

1304
01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:40,299
reviewer for that but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we could</font>

1305
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,880
so at least three of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> atoms could</font>

1306
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:46,960
go that way and and the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> die die die</font>

1307
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,880
one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I think that one</font>

1308
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,069
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy one right i mean</font>

1309
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:54,089
listing the attacks is not necessary

1310
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:57,040
like being extremely thorough is nice

1311
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:59,350
but if if that's a problem in terms of

1312
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,290
energy for reviewing look everybody

1313
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:04,060
knows single des is not a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and</font>

1314
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,920
our c4 is not a good idea so just

1315
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:08,020
basically tell people to stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1316
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:12,430
and that's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough move move some</font>

1317
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:15,130
bits of perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the RFC's 1964 biz</font>

1318
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:18,640
that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> 41-21 plus the missing</font>

1319
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:22,600
bits and just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop 1964 to historic</font>

1320
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,890
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know PK cross perhaps the</font>

1321
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,920
easiest way to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

1322
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:30,279
implement and let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let people</font>

1323
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:32,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> downline people</font>

1324
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:35,200
actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardize it we could</font>

1325
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:36,670
write so that's you know that that one I

1326
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,700
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't necessarily need to be</font>

1327
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:42,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopted the only ones that really need</font>

1328
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:44,740
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted in terms of review from</font>

1329
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:47,529
the working group are the service

1330
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:51,969
discovery extra round trip and<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSS only</font>

1331
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:57,640
n types those are not there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no other</font>

1332
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:59,380
way to do those I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the the</font>

1333
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">des die die die what I think would be</font>

1334
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,970
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd outside the working</font>

1335
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:06,519
group if need be because it's it's so

1336
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:08,710
obvious right I don't

1337
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">these people should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just stop using it</font>

1338
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">triple dad's here with us yeah yeah okay</font>

1339
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:19,860
Oh ripple does that's yeah okay I just

1340
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the joke Triple DES triple die yeah</font>

1341
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:28,300
well those I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I mean can go to the</font>

1342
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:30,190
registry directly I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn had asked</font>

1343
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,360
if the the last naming attributes could

1344
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:33,490
be rolled<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the generic gaming</font>

1345
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,160
attributes oh yeah it could be yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1346
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:37,750
could do that I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely do that</font>

1347
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I didn't do that because I</font>

1348
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:41,670
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people would think it was</font>

1349
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:44,170
a bad idea so so I thought that

1350
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:47,530
impersonation attributes perhaps needed

1351
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:52,690
some review but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also fairly</font>

1352
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:55,059
obvious right so it's it's you can't use

1353
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:57,820
it by accident if you're using it you

1354
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,710
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using it on with a credential</font>

1355
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,530
that that really has no authorization

1356
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:07,390
other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spits with</font>

1357
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:09,580
specific peers right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that one</font>

1358
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:11,440
definitely goes in generic finally the

1359
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:14,890
last thing I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say is the generic</font>

1360
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:18,280
naming attributes is a very nice way

1361
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:19,900
treating names is a pig but but having

1362
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,570
both of this play form and a query

1363
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Foreman and a bag of attributes you can</font>

1364
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:29,259
access with as a simple interface

1365
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:31,780
actually it is applicable out outside of

1366
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:35,860
GSS as well right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect for TLS</font>

1367
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:38,559
as well right if you want to provide

1368
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:40,719
applications with access to something a

1369
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,220
little simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> then here's a certificate</font>

1370
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:48,790
chain and you go have your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> asn.1</font>

1371
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:51,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">pickax parser thing that that be handy</font>

1372
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:54,130
right so one of the attributes is yes I

1373
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:57,370
validated it up to a trust anchor and

1374
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:59,410
here's the trust anchor or perhaps you

1375
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:01,570
could set a trust anchor on your on your

1376
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:02,800
acceptor<font color="#CCCCCC"> principal or your initiative</font>

1377
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,900
principal saying these are the trust

1378
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,910
anchors I trust right so having a way to

1379
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,070
to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more policy at</font>

1380
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application or access to a little</font>

1381
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:14,940
bit more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be used</font>

1382
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:18,079
for policy might make for an API that

1383
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:21,530
others might want to copy

1384
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:23,268
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think that might make it</font>

1385
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:26,358
more more desirable as a working group

1386
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:28,339
item them but the tls people for example

1387
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:33,589
are very busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now anyway so I</font>

1388
01:12:28,339 --> 01:12:35,179
don't think they'll care but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1389
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:37,879
decide that we care and<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday we'll</font>

1390
01:12:35,179 --> 01:12:41,809
plug it at them maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1391
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:45,589
a working group item I don't know all

1392
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:48,829
right um so I guess next steps on this

1393
01:12:45,589 --> 01:12:52,699
one is the chairs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly our ID</font>

1394
01:12:48,829 --> 01:12:54,379
will discuss which ones we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start</font>

1395
01:12:52,699 --> 01:13:00,320
bringing in I mean what I will note that

1396
01:12:54,379 --> 01:13:03,439
we've got also ooh this list of

1397
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:07,728
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that still need to even even</font>

1398
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:09,499
go through so I mean sure but I'm just

1399
01:13:07,729 --> 01:13:11,510
saying just saying that I mean there's a

1400
01:13:09,499 --> 01:13:13,280
number of documents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the queue to prep</font>

1401
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:16,219
for working group last call that's an

1402
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,809
awful this is an awful lot of work but

1403
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:20,149
we can we can discuss see which ones

1404
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:22,909
make the most sense to try to bring

1405
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:25,639
forward and maybe we'll go through some

1406
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:26,869
sort of staggering exercise its bit of

1407
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:30,139
staggering is video stephen froese like

1408
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:31,369
and staggering is fine and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1409
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">before you get to the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1410
01:13:31,369 --> 01:13:35,329
current list more will popped up anyway

1411
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:36,919
well that seemed sure right that's

1412
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:38,808
that's why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a staggering right</font>

1413
01:13:36,919 --> 01:13:41,089
i mean but we've got an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1414
01:13:38,809 --> 01:13:43,159
things waiting the wings that are gonna

1415
01:13:41,089 --> 01:13:55,129
require attention this is this is pretty

1416
01:13:43,159 --> 01:14:01,188
big list<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so i think we are</font>

1417
01:13:55,129 --> 01:14:03,139
actually at our open mic time which if

1418
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:05,839
if nobody's got anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives us</font>

1419
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:09,379
15 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have one thing stayed</font>

1420
01:14:05,839 --> 01:14:11,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">entirely so I Sean as he indicated i</font>

1421
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:13,459
think was the plan was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

1422
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:15,409
kind of clear to go / sean Sam<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>
