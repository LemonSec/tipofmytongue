74
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,669
we're trying to solve here on the basic

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,069
problem trying to solve is like not

76
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:07,209
enough TLS on the internet or security

77
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,168
in general but especially not<font color="#E5E5E5"> FTL</font>

estimates out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla Firefox</font>

81
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,659
preliminary that roughly thirty percent

82
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,978
of page loads are over HTTPS and roughly

83
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,900
sixty-five percent of transactions are

84
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,039
on the these numbers are different

85
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,900
because I things like YouTube and Gmail

86
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,090
because gmail is a fantastic number of

87

transactions on doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ajax even though</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't like actually change debate</font>

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,919
on this number is one hundred percent on

90
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">three 110% really but hundred it was a</font>

this numbers in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes would like um</font>

93
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,130
but there's a general feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

123
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,090
now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think um has been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

124
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and on so the</font>

125
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,489
background for this for this Bluff i

126
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,650
think is this new initiative called

127
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,730
let's encrypt that we announced on the

128
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:07,370
last IETF that aspires to do a new free

129
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,300
transparent automatic CA<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna</font>

130
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,390
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very much this is</font>

131
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,010
motivation um but the objectives we have

132
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,440
is it should be free it should be

133
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,610
automatic it should be secure

134
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,200
transparent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah blah blah all these</font>

135
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,190
good things but easy is the biz that

136
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,190
it's like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be getting out</font>

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this right um so if it's going to be</font>

138
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,180
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to have to have</font>

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,770
automation that's clear next slide so

140
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,820
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a protocol</font>

141
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,320
machinery<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint is we automation of</font>

142
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,300
all the major operations so that it

143
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,890
reduces the operational costs for us so

144
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can do this for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free and it is the</font>

145
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,599
operational costs for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server</font>

146
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,099
operator so they're incentivized to do

147
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big pain in the ass that</font>

148
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,760
means the registration has to be has to

149
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,830
be automatic the domain control

150
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,360
validation that is verifying that you

151
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,520
are entailed to operate the domain that

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,850
you claim to be entitled to assert for

153
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,950
that's automatic and on something people

154
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,870
often don't realize is that the renewal

155
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,700
is tificate has to be automatic on so

156
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,410
it's really common to see people who

157
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,450
have what a certificate of year ago and

158
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,470
they forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to renew on and</font>

159
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,880
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the strictly spira sanitized</font>

160
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,650
inaccessible even though it's accessible

161
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 minutes ago that's really sucky so</font>

162
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,330
what we want is on a single time

163
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,860
interaction with the ca from the users

164
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,659
perspective where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say i want to</font>

165
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,310
certificate and then their server

166
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,700
continues to function in perpetuity with

167
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,350
no intervention by them whatsoever um

168
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,630
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by seamless on the UM</font>

169
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,650
we have some demos our site um there's

170
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,810
nothing particular special too

171
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,580
complicated especially the demos um that

172
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,160
you know you type some crap at the

173
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,270
command line apache and say like I want

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,130
the sword and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes and it just</font>

175
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,780
retrieves it and a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes I your</font>

176
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,890
system is running so and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

177
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,479
on it she continues to work that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

178
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,360
you want and finally we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

179
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,190
flexible<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so if cas changed their</font>

180
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,720
policies and practices we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

181
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,610
a face to fighting chance because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

182
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,820
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your server will continue to</font>

183
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,500
operate on even under those changes so

184
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,280
say the ca decides for instance that

185
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,560
they

186
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,729
on that require sha-3 certificates on it

187
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,630
really be nice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't have to do</font>

188
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:05,900
anything to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work next slide so</font>

189
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,480
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some examples of the kinds of</font>

190
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,969
challenges that we think that a protocol

191
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,630
does this has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to arm you know</font>

192
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,280
encounter to<font color="#E5E5E5"> v mq so here's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

193
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,680
on certificate lifetimes right

194
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,630
certificates now tend to have relatively

195
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,780
long lifetimes year five years ten years

196
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,600
whatever um and we rely on ocsp<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

197
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,210
revocation and as low CSP is like good

198
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,210
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a bad day um so on</font>

199
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,429
right now on I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe any major</font>

200
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,979
browser or hard fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no CSP ocsp</font>

201
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,770
failures on so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it certificates</font>

202
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,570
revoked on basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the attacker</font>

203
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,010
has to do is gag the ocsp server and the

204
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,140
browser will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

205
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,270
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> um there's been a lot of talk</font>

206
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">about doing on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tough called must</font>

207
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,699
staple um full palm<font color="#CCCCCC"> banker's draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

208
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,829
this about requiring basically you can

209
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,839
get ocsp response and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can stop</font>

210
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,220
at the TLS handshake and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

211
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,630
to indicate in the certificate that that

212
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,339
better be there or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should fail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

213
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">feels like i doing that with hard fail</font>

214
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,270
on by which i mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that weren't</font>

215
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">there you actually fail you would even</font>

216
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to use P query um there's also a lot</font>

217
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,689
of talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about shortlist certificates on</font>

218
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,970
what students are stiff<font color="#CCCCCC"> achatz which</font>

219
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,230
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifetime on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same order bonus</font>

220
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ESP response so you know somewhere</font>

221
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,550
between a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> days to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a week or so um</font>

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,860
and this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn into OCS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pms staple</font>

223
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,329
there's isomorphism between these um so

224
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,670
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like this is a natural fit</font>

225
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,170
for automatic renewal right on if we

226
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,240
have a system which automatically on

227
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,910
goes and gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> in just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to forget whatever</font>

228
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,980
it needs one on then that's adaptable

229
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,959
but that's adaptable if a CA decide so

230
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to laterally shrink the lifetime of</font>

231
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate down from like a year to</font>

232
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,020
six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two week or whatever on</font>

233
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,060
because the server tells you when you

234
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,460
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assert the ca does and you just</font>

235
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,319
go get so this is an opportunity for CH

236
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,480
we have adapt<font color="#CCCCCC"> our policies on with</font>

237
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,500
people who are you know without

238
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,870
requiring the user to go through a

239
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,250
horrible horrible birds um as opposed to

240
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,690
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel lead and it's a hassle so</font>

241
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,700
it's one kind of challenge you'd like to

242
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:03,020
have this be a result next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

243
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,780
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example being you over those um</font>

244
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,550
so right now you know servers typically

245
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,760
support RSA sometimes in support ecdsa

246
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,430
certificates

247
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,290
um so what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we now know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CFR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G is</font>

248
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,359
defining to curse and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's go do</font>

249
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,790
signatures perhaps over those curves or

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,170
Moody's EDD essay or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

251
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,569
signatures your post quantum or whatever

252
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,459
right on so the you can't make this

253
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite a seamless because obviously you</font>

254
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,130
can't preemptively add these things to

255
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,109
your client before you know they exist

256
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,700
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on if you have an automatic</font>

257
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,250
negotiation one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen is</font>

258
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,020
that basically the ca can add the

259
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,670
capability to issue for these new kinds

260
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,790
of keys and then when you update your

261
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,920
server software it says oh I noticed the

262
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,990
ca can now assume eeeddd SAS I'm going

263
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,250
to get one of those as well on so it's

264
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,990
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite as nice but you can still do</font>

265
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:50,660
automatic upgrade something that's the

266
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">future you like to have next slide um</font>

267
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,870
the final feature that um again this is

268
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">all exemplary I'm not like the sauce</font>

269
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,120
posting exhaustive list but trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

270
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,580
give you a sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of things</font>

271
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,150
challenges we think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face um</font>

272
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:06,240
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um delegate issuance so on say you</font>

273
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,370
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big server farm and um you have I</font>

274
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,350
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know lots of lots of servers for a</font>

275
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,970
given domain or lots of domains for a

276
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,020
given server boat engine or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

277
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,070
some Nixon mask thing where you have

278
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,540
like a big server farm<font color="#E5E5E5"> that serves</font>

279
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,400
hundreds of the mains on thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

280
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,130
servers we'd like some<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment we'd like</font>

281
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,480
to know some you know a binary selection

282
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,330
for each one goes which unchanged in a

283
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,000
daily basis um so it's really a pain if

284
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to keep revalidate and it</font>

285
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,120
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really nice if you could</font>

286
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,090
establish control hood of each domain

287
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,530
once and then whenever you want a new

288
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,870
server that stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and supports a new</font>

289
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,189
subset of the other names you<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply say</font>

290
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay give me a certificate that matches</font>

291
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,550
that exactly um and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

292
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,690
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> actvities done this is a pia it</font>

293
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,280
works obviously there's an

294
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,480
authentication key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is tied to some</font>

295
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,040
class of domains and then you can

296
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,890
request issuance for any subset of that

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,599
um so uh that's basically another thing

298
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,560
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond heaven next slide ah</font>

299
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,290
good i should<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention one more thing um</font>

300
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,239
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon my slides um did the other</font>

301
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,969
thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is on it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

302
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,970
flexibility of validation mechanisms on

303
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,350
so right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> c is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some small some</font>

304
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,850
of them are validation mechanisms it'd

305
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,110
sure be nice to have a system that was

306
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,000
there was flexible about that in

307
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular in this contest which really</font>

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,910
relevant as Dane and so right now you

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,350
know if you offer Dane on and you know

310
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,630
there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very small fraction of</font>

311
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">line</font>

312
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,410
if any which can accept that right on

313
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,760
but I mean the future that might not be

314
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case but there's a chicken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and egg</font>

315
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,939
problem because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard use Dane</font>

316
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,219
without getting a backup certificate for

317
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">ordinary TLS so one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

318
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,030
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a sort of automatic protocol</font>

319
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:40,210
is you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply say you can simply</font>

320
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,819
transition from date from date from you

321
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,040
know Dame<font color="#E5E5E5"> + 509 to Dane only in a</font>

322
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,330
gradual way with the automatic system

323
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,650
picking up the slack of basically

324
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,870
automatically recien your certificates

325
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on your Dean records so that on so</font>

326
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,170
basically this gives you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> temporary</font>

327
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,220
bridge while we should get why didn't

328
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,260
deployment so that's particular

329
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,400
relevance context on and again it's a

330
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,790
feat is something you don't we do if you

331
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:04,180
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of automation so on</font>

332
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:06,610
you know my overall message is that that

333
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,400
whatever protocol on is needed here on

334
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,670
is one that is has enough flexibility to

335
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,199
you know let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward in a way</font>

336
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,180
that requires minimal user intervention

337
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,860
on as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

some really nice work it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if</font>

347
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,330
we could all<font color="#CCCCCC"> use kind of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same stuff</font>

348
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,980
um um you know as usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know we</font>

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">need this anyway so we'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead but</font>

350
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,650
it would great if we could find people

351
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,340
to collaborate with and if there's

359
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,140
frankly when we looked a test on it also

360
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,810
wasn't convenient for the platforms that

361
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:18,400
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested implementing on sir</font>

364
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,350
gardens turns out that in many<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

365
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,770
it's it's more cost effective to use a

366
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,960
commercial CA than to set up your own

367
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,630
internal CA for servers that are not on

368
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet yes i would have liked for</font>

or a flock of this or whatever to be

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,720
usable for internally within enterprises

372
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,580
right so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that actually</font>

373
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,839
on again that's not that's not let the

online validation and usually would be

387
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,519

would assume we compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ship your</font>

transparency um but you know we're

397
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,510
talking to finding a protocol on so I

398
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,520
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd mandate it on in the</font>

protocol specification Michael

400
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,579
Richardson um so I had two<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions one</font>

401
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,310
was about things that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP I'm</font>

402
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:54,020
thinking specifically i'm at pop yes and

403
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,760
that stuff particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for places that</font>

404
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe can be made to work where it's all</font>

405
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,910
one all one box it also has a web server

406
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,649
for that same name but the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

407
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that actually i think is more import</font>

408
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:11,310
more interesting important in the walled

409
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:14,220
garden space is the lights out I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lahm's</font>

410
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:17,609
those those boxes where we're

411
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,149
essentially train training junior to

412
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,490
mid-level IT people to forever click

413
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:26,640
through the certificate warning because

414
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,589
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> just never has one yes and I</font>

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,079
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if if that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking if</font>

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,630
that is is somehow inscape making it fit

00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,849
into these right the client-side fit

418
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,189
into that space these are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

419
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,079
they're not particularly constrained but

420
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,699
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really annoying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monsters so I</font>

421
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,019
think there's a let's encrypt answer and

422
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,060
a acne and serve either a little

423
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,220
different on I think from<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's your</font>

424
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,750
perspective we're not primarily focused

425
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,150
on either those cases initially

426
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,680
um although<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know at some point in</font>

427
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,120
the future we might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing non-web it's just a web is the</font>

429
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,880
first target on from an acne perspective

430
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,980
I'd be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad if acne as it came out</font>

431
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,150
could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be extended to handle exactly</font>

432
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,180
the cases you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about for other</font>

433
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,290
kinds of non web services and then if

434
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,939
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the design there's a sort of</font>

435
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,409
extensible proof mechanism for being

436
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,300
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove possession of different</font>

437
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,709
things and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly hope that that</font>

438
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,560
mechanism we flexible enough to support

439
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things that were not wet on for</font>

440
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,310
the perspective of of Eylau stuff like

441
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,920
that on the like the problem with any

442
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,089
walled garden scenario is is is there a

443
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,260
mechanism for demonstrate what is the

444
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,520
identity you're asserting what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

445
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,450
mechanist rating control identity and on

446
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,800
certainly if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could tell me what the</font>

447
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,140
mechanism for demonstrating control the

448
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,669
entities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> iowa was I could to have a</font>

449
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,870
conversation about what how that would

450
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,640
work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> until I figured</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

451
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,050
confused so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to cut the line</font>

452
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,540
here remember we're and have a general

453
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,190
discussion after the full set of slides

454
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,010
but no no that means the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

455
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,220
in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then Daniel you have that</font>

456
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">JJ hi Daniel can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gilmore so I just</font>

457
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,740
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out that it actually</font>

458
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,450
isn't completely orthogonal to

459
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,260
certificate transparency particularly in

460
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,790
the section that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

461
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,220
ramping down the time for the

462
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,020
certificates one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ocsp</font>

463
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,480
lets you do is you have fewer<font color="#E5E5E5"> certs in</font>

464
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,650
the log and then you have regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> ocsp</font>

465
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,060
update yes if we're talking about

466
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,340
ramping down to shortlist certs and

467
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,500
we're logging everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the log</font>

468
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,810
balloons<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside that's absolutely true</font>

469
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,850
on on so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a nitride about</font>

470
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,740
this a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think</font>

471
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,679
I suggested to bend that perhaps it'd be

472
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,990
nice if CT with log key identity pairs

473
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,130
route in logging certificates um for

474
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,270
precisely that for precisely this reason

475
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:33,140
um Oh fantastic follows a better wife um

476
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,700
so but I'm just just generally um um

477
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,840
you're quite right yeah obviously CT

478
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,350
will not scale well if you have to like

479
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,350
issues because every 22 minutes yeah

480
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,929
yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I think actually that's</font>

481
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,939
just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things you put on the</font>

482
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:55,590
requirements at pile and just trust as

483
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:01,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we're going to come back we'll have</font>

484
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:04,530
an answer so next slide please so i'm

485
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,870
still home baker and with comodo I've

486
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,510
spoken to some of the industry partners

487
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:14,070
but we've not really got into a long

488
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:15,740
discussion with it so I'm talk so when I

489
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,780
was talking from experience here it's

490
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,919
it's confined to komodo but I only speak

491
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,350
of a promoter but i think is probably

492
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,780
the same for<font color="#E5E5E5"> most other large cas so</font>

493
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,389
where we are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we actually have</font>

494
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,418
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make automation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

495
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,490
certificate issue possible and raise

496
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,690
reasonably straightforward so we have

497
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">standards-based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting at the</font>

498
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,549
enrollment we've got easy to use and

499
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,799
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they're two</font>

500
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,770
completely separate paths we would like

501
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,760
these two things to be one now why do we

502
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,309
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from our proprietary</font>

503
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,770
standards to the to a standard sorry

504
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:53,100
proprietary schemes to a standards-based

505
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,100
one next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide well the answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

506
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,678
plugins just don't deliver at the moment

507
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:02,040
to use our automated schemes you have to

508
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,140
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in in your server and the</font>

509
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,010
administrative costs of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in is</font>

510
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:11,190
vastly greater than the time saved in

511
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:14,490
cut and pasting a csr and yes I know

512
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a 45 minutes</font>

513
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:20,280
for current well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what putting a</font>

514
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,149
plug-in into your web server is a lot

515
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than 45 minutes and I'm the problem</font>

516
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:31,049
with plugins is you can't test them

517
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:37,200
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah one plug-in works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too is a</font>

518
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:39,120
combinatorial problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> at three well so</font>

519
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,179
you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't test the interactions I</font>

520
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,500
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to a standards-based</font>

521
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:46,799
mechanism because that's the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

522
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,809
that I can automate this scheme in a way

523
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:53,049
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things actually easier for my</font>

524
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:55,928
customer rather than harder next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

525
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:59,320
so looking at our looking from our

526
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,860
position as an established CA what we

527
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,299
want that's common with the alexan crypt

528
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,110
manifesto is we want frictionless

529
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:11,769
usability so like I posited in prison

530
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:14,889
proof email no absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> no unnecessary</font>

531
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:17,169
user effort the user should not need to

532
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:19,508
do anything differently when setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

533
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,730
a secure website to setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a regular</font>

534
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">website unless some additional</font>

535
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">information is required from the user</font>

536
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:29,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely want though</font>

537
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:32,980
short-lived certs a killer for us would

538
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,460
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no any new SN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 here from my prom to</font>

539
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,820
view the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canon of SN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 schema has closed</font>

540
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,690
we have burned all our<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 compiler</font>

541
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,639
tools we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new stuff we</font>

542
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,739
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason and the reason for that I'll</font>

543
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:50,859
come to that little bit later but it

544
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:52,659
makes it possible to solve all the

545
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:55,178
additional requirements that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

546
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:58,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to without making the base spec</font>

547
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to too complicated we also want whatever</font>

548
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:05,918
I mean Acme in some ways is going to be

549
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:08,669
the first Jason based security spec we

550
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,950
would like whatever tropes that Acme

551
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:14,289
introduces in producing a protocol to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

552
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,230
tropes that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use on other security</font>

553
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:19,090
protocols without having the how we're

554
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,330
going to use JSON discussion coming up

555
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">every time we also need to interrupt</font>

556
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,309
with existing back-end systems and we

557
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:31,379
have hardware security modules and

558
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:35,080
lockdown systems that expect to see a

559
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:36,609
CSR for proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of possession so that's</font>

560
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,119
one place where we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

561
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:42,850
maintaining compatibility with existing

562
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:47,139
sn1 but we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see any new sn1</font>

563
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,998
structures appear next slide so looking

564
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:51,580
at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our point of view specific</font>

565
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:55,450
requirements we obviously want a choice

566
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:59,379
of CA there and we also want a way of

567
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,269
charging the customer and we also want

568
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:04,269
to support all our<font color="#E5E5E5"> p kicks based</font>

569
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:06,370
products I for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be a</font>

570

very<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting move to move</font>

571
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,550
just my TLS customers with DV

572
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,950
certificates to a new enrollment

573
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,649
protocol it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only really going to be</font>

574
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,080
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me is if I can move all</font>

575
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,809
my cust of this to all my customers for

576
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,830
all their needs so that if they choose

577
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:31,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have six TV sets and then upgrade to</font>

578
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,100
EV then that's possible for them we want

579
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,530
to do TLS and we also want to do s mine

580
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,830
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a large number three</font>

581
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:40,149
quarter of a million s mindsets paid

582
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,580
which shocked the heck out of me when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

583
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:46,059
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out but it turns out to be</font>

584
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,649
what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> also so one thing that this</font>

585
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,450
means that you can't assume the issue is

586
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:53,020
the issue of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate is going to</font>

587
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,660
happen immediately if you're doing

588
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:00,820
extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> validation or organizational</font>

589
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:03,429
validation you're going to start the the

590
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,990
attempt to register and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

591
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:07,900
information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to come in</font>

592
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,690
out of bound and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font>

593
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,980
a run this tool once and then you're

594
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">done there's going to have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

595
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,450
delay and some ability to pick up

596
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,340
certificates after the fact but actually

597
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,559
that's not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that difficult different</font>

598
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the certificate renewal problem</font>

599
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,940
which also has to be solved and

600
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,679
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

601
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">add in those additional criteria for the</font>

602
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,660
validation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for EV etc oh and</font>

603
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">private-label certs are also quite big</font>

604
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,520
that we have quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of certs that</font>

605
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:41,050
don't appear in TLS our public CA is at

606
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,610
all so next side another bigger industry

607
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:46,540
specific requirements probably have more

608
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:49,300
impact on the model is we use local

609
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,980
registration authorities for a lot of

610
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,470
certificate issues if you're a large

611
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,170
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> like say a heel at Packard</font>

612
00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:00,160
or whatever you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to have</font>

613
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:03,940
part of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA infrastructure deployed</font>

614
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,309
inside the enterprise and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

615
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,470
certificate issue is taking place on CA

616
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:11,170
back end but you've got a lot of local

617
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,140
control so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an ACME model</font>

618
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,570
that allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide an enterprise</font>

619
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,520

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,550
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that the way you want to</font>

632
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,650
configure that in the cloud is when a

633
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,020
new web server comes up or a new mail

634

type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which certificate registration</font>

640
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:12,060
is only one small fraction there will be

641
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:15,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">a massive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amplification of Acme rather</font>

642

than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the base acting protocol we</font>

can see all the certificates that they

have subscribed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that are currently</font>

647
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:31,590

648
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:34,890
device there 666 example.com we've got a

649
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:39,449
certificate for it what's it doing you

650
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:41,640
know and in some cases you might want

651
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,460
private key information to be traveling

652
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,370
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LRA to the device I'll explain</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that on the list they're</font>

654
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:54,510
a bit complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some</font>

655
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,880
technical points we've got that there's

656
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,920
a record the certificate authority

657
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,340
authorization record which is an

658
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,860
existing RFC there are hooks in that it

659
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,280
was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be expandable where</font>

660
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,199
you're trying to discover where is my CA

661
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,320
what CA should i register under CA

662
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,080
records might be one way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do</font>

663
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,530
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> paul hoffman when we're</font>

identifying the ca for this very purpose

<font color="#CCCCCC">that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have bits in the code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

673
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:48,929
nailed down and exclude particular

674
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:51,689
applications one of the nice things

675
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:55,049
about Jason is you can add in slots as

676
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:59,340
required provided you've not made some

677
00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:01,529
brain-dead assumption in the system so

678
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example don't assume that when</font>

679
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:06,539
you're making these requests of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ca</font>

680
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,570
or the server or whatever don't assume

681
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:13,350
that the key that the server is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

682
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:14,610
use is going to be the same key that so

683
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,799
the key that the service is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

684
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,570
for TLS is going to be the same ski that

685
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,610
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for subscribing</font>

686
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,220
for certificates and authenticating that

687
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:27,990
request you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want those to be</font>

688
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,809
different actually so next slide and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

689
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to rate this isn't our</font>

690
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:35,908
IPR but when you're designing the

691
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,070
validation protocol will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

692
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:42,090
sensitive to the fact that there are

693
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:45,600
quite a few cas out there that have read

694
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:48,990
have patents<font color="#E5E5E5"> pending or issued that</font>

695
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:55,199
cover methods are validating DV certs

696
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:57,059
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know our scheme took</font>

697
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,980
us a long time to work out because we

698
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:02,460
were dancing around I all this i PR I

699
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,100
don't have that all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I PR in my head</font>

700
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,830
sorry I would have to do quite a bit of

701
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">research to work out who owns what and</font>

702
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:14,760
so on but when we're designing this

703
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,989
protocol we should not assume that

704
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,399
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be just one way of</font>

705
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:23,340
validating the cert because if we if we

706
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:30,959
do that then we'll end up being sued up

707
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:33,500
the ass and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sir questions gosh</font>

708
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,750
I answered all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your questions</font>

709
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,100
okay let's bring Richard up and well

710
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,830
he's coming up a quick question who

711
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,540
hasn't signed the blue sheet oh my

please raise your hand again which box

Joyce diamond

717
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,190
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is richard barnes i worked</font>

718
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,900
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> mozilla and I've been helping out</font>

719
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,030
with drafting the spec for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter</font>

720
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,250
code projects which we're trying to

721
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,740
generalize out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> projects be this</font>

722
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,410
general acne protocol next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

723
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,790
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is you know you you install</font>

724
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,590
some piece of software is going to do

725
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the acne magic and auto configure</font>

726
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,370
server with the cert and all that but

727
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,710
what really happens under the sheets

728
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:33,629
when we do the protocol here so i

729
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:35,730
thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful and oak what yeah</font>

730
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,020
yeah so if you're not your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop's out</font>

731
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,240
what you all do you love the URL at the

732
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,800
top you can see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> form on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop</font>

733
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,040
but the idea here is I thought it was

734
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful to look at what an existing free</font>

735
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,899
cert issuance process looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so this</font>

736
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a web form from whoa sign of Chinese</font>

737
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:54,900
CA that is offers a free ssl cert

738
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,010
service and they collect a bunch of

739
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,740
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> information here so you have</font>

740
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell them the domain name and</font>

741
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,170
whatever else you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in the</font>

742
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,929
certificates they have like duration

743
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:05,790
fields and things like that they have a

744
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,140
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you can verify</font>

745
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you control the domain you can</font>

746
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,930
provision a file on your web server I

747
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,149
think they'll do the email style

748
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,710
verification as well you have to provide

749
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,660
them a CSR to show that you own<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

750
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,460
private key that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want corresponding</font>

751
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,740
the cert you want you provide them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

752
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,350
contact an email address and a password

753
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,970
so that you can prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

754
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,949
you know you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy who requested</font>

755
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,240
this cert and<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified it possession of</font>

756
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,460
the domain when you go to pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

757
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,650
cert<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them they also have a CAPTCHA</font>

758
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,240
and a subscriber agreement which it

759
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:37,710
turns out is required by the ca browser

760
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,750
for them if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be a CA so this</font>

761
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">is sort of an example of the sorts of</font>

762
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that we probably want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to capture</font>

763
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,600
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting protocol right these are</font>

764
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,520
the sorts of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the</font>

765
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,840
web server or the thing requesting a

766
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,940
cert is going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

767
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,879
CA in order for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

768
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,350
issue a certificate so next slide this

769
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,200
is a diagram out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> act</font>

770
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,939
nice back of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how the acne</font>

771
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,320
protocol reflects these pieces of

772
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,670
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry the green is so</font>

773
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,669
bright<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a little hard to read</font>

774
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:08,580
but the idea is we have three basic

775
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:10,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">types of object with one kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of sub</font>

776
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,879
object we talk in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of registrations</font>

777
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:17,010
authorizations and certificates so

778
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,440
registrations cover the Who<font color="#CCCCCC"> am I</font>

779
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,760
the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contact information the</font>

780
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,340
authentic the credentials that you're

781
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use to to access the acne</font>

782
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,290
service so that's where we have contact

783
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and authentication and the</font>

784
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,870
subscriber agreement concept so

785
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,670
registration is you when you first show

786
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,050
up at an acting server you register you

787
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,720
go to the new registration endpoint you

788
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,370
get a registration and then you head

789
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,550
over to the new authorization endpoint

790
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:47,340
at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

791
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:49,169
prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I own example.com you put in</font>

792
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,780
the domain name<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want and you do this</font>

793
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,820
authorization process acne then has a

794
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,560
challenging response sort of protocol

795
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,240
for verifying domain control and it's

796
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,280
extensible to support bunch of different

797
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,360
a few different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of ways to do that</font>

798
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:05,970
domain validation I use domains here as

799
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,490
an aside we use domains in the slides

800
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,220
here but the way the protocol structured

801
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,350
there's it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed there's a typed up</font>

802
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,170
for the identifier structure has a type

803
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:18,719
and a value so you can currently define

804
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,980
type as domain name but you in principle

805
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,420
the protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> could support other types</font>

806
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier is like phone numbers or</font>

807
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">mac addresses or whatever the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

808
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,280
validate you'd need different challenge

809
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,620
types to verify possession of those

810
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,960
identifiers but in principle the

811
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,919
protocol is extensible in that way so

812
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,210
you go through this challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

813
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,830
response thing to prove you own the

814
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:38,130
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name and then you can hop over</font>

815
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:41,010
this new cert endpoint and drop your<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSR</font>

816
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:43,140
in and get a cert if once you proved

817
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're authorized the reason for the</font>

818
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:49,140
separations we've got here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> twofold um</font>

819
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">the separation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between authorizations</font>

820
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,530
and certificates you might note that

821
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,480
authorizations look sort of like

822
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:57,720
certificates in that they're set there a

823
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,700
statement by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA that we the CA</font>

824
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,280
believes that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are authorized to act</font>

825
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,960
for this domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we</font>

826
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,250
separated those from certificates is to

827
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,320
support some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the use cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker</font>

828
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,600
called out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his slides where you might</font>

829
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,060
want to have a data center where you've

830
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,889
got hundreds of different servers

831
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,929
serving different combinations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands</font>

832
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,600
and you want to verify you wanna prove

833
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,820
ownership of each of those the domains

834
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,960
that the servers are recovering once and

835
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,060
then be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue a bunch of</font>

different<font color="#CCCCCC"> combinations issue</font>

837
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,840
certificates with a bunch of different

838
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">combinations of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those those names so the</font>

839
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,570
idea is you do the authorization to

840
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,820
prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

841
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,770
control each name and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

842
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,170
certificates with any combination of the

843
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,850
names that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you control the separation</font>

844
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">between registration and authorization</font>

845
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:44,069
was to try and separate things that are

846
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,719
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> regarded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as public from things</font>

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were getting three people</font>

855
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:05,250
because for obvious sort of spam and

856
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,690
privacy reasons that also lets us it

857
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,310
opens up the door for acne to support

858
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,170
sort of user management models<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

859
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,150
groups and things like that adds an

860
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,950
additional level flexibility so that's

861
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overall architecture of how the</font>

862
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,700
protocol hangs together I've got some

863
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,470
examples of concrete protocol messages

864
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:23,509
on the subsequent slides the whole

865
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:26,520
protocol runs in JSON messages over HTTP

866
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,250
all the messages from the client to the

867
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,710
server from the subscriber to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA are</font>

868
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,440
signed with a key pair that key pair

869
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:38,040
acts as the account identifier for the

870
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,900
the entity replying for certificates in

871
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,380
the document without an account key pair

872
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,630
so with registration we begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

873
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,640
associating contact information and

874
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,250
agreement with some terms with that key

875
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,290
pair so that is initiates the user into

876
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,260
the into the ca's management system and

877
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:58,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">the CA just says yes sure I've got this</font>

878
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:00,840
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide when the once you've</font>

879
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,780
registered and have sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said this is</font>

880
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,900
my public key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Who I am you can then</font>

881
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,180
sign requests to authenticate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

882
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,610
authorized for a domain with that key

883
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,250
pair so this the message on the left

884
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,270
here says is the subscriber saying I

885
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:20,460
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> request authorization for</font>

886
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:24,870
example org for that domain name and the

887
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">signature by the account key pair vine</font>

888
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:30,440
associates this authorization request

889
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,130
with that entity that's requesting it

890
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,560
now here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it gets kind of</font>

891
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,180
interesting so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscriber says I</font>

892
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,040
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove control of example</font>

893
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,790
organ<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server responds with an</font>

894
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,040
authorization object so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a status</font>

895
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:46,320
we have sort of pending valid invalids

896
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,420
sort of status as you would expect it

897
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,580
echoes back the<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier and the key</font>

898
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,170
that's that were requested and then it

899
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,750
actually issues a set of challenges it

900
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:57,300
says the service says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you want</font>

901
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to prove that you own example org here's</font>

902
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,420
how I require you to do it next slide

903
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">please so like I said acne has an</font>

904
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,860
extensible set of challenge type so each

905
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,950
challenge message has a type thing that

906
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">says here is the mechanism you should</font>

907
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,319
use to to prove your control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

908
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,080
domain I think there's two or three in

909
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

910
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,720
especially as if additional identifier

911
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,480
types are added you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will need different</font>

912
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,459
types of challenge but then the other

913
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,340
fields and the challenge say here's some

914
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,050
properties of the URI is how you respond

915
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge and then the token is</font>

916
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,790
the the stuff you're supposed to

917
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,830
provision so simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS asks you to go</font>

918
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,900
provision of files of a given path on a

919
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,240
web server and then the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

920
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,970
here's how you go check that I fulfilled

921
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,910
that challenge yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ellis connects me</font>

922
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:49,439
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS is the only way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dacian</font>

923
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:55,350
message you are thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> or could</font>

924
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,750
it also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS paste I believe in the</font>

925
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:00,810
document right now we have simple HTTPS

926
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:03,750
a one mechanism it's based on server

927
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:06,990
name indication in TLS and a DNS based

928
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,860
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um obviously if people</font>

929
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,779
have other ideas for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ways that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

930
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,580
third party could validate that another

931
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:20,100
party owns a domain name yeah we're open

932
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,750
and it may be also that there's sort of

933
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,130
pre validation cases can be handled with

934
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:28,440
different challenge challenge types as

935
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:29,970
well so yeah the flow is you know you

936
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,950
get this challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the authorization</font>

937
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,660
method and then you post<font color="#E5E5E5"> this response</font>

938
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,460
back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI that's in the challenge</font>

939
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,870
so you respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge specific</font>

940
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:42,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on and I sort of leave out a</font>

941
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:45,900
step there but once you once you've

942
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,190
completed this and the the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

943
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,860
gone off and verified to the domain

944
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:53,700
control the client can pull that

945
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,620
authorization URL it got and look for

946
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,410
that authorization to turn green to turn

947
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,810
from pending

948
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,609
and then it knows it's bent is that the

949
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:04,690
ca considers it authorized for example

950
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:06,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm next slide please so now the client</font>

951
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,350
knows that authorized for example.com it

952
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:12,549
can go ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certificate this is</font>

953
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:15,250
pretty minimal Eve generates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PK cs10</font>

954
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">CSR sends a link to the authorization</font>

955
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,900
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client believes authorizes a</font>

956
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,189
certificate signs it to prove you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

957
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,410
that it's bound to his authorized

958
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,990
account key and sends it up to the

959
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,149
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the server sends back the</font>

960
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:31,390
certificate if he agrees and sends back

961
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:35,380
an error code if not yeah suppose I have

962
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:39,609
web servants and I get to owned for a

963
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:42,160
half hour by a hacker and now I found

964
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:45,970
out about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I clean up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server but</font>

965
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:49,330
now he already has a certificate for my

966
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:51,939
server for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years instead</font>

967
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:59,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyway i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know for me to</font>

968
00:39:51,940 --> 00:40:01,060
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it or or something yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

969
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,380
move units are for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i mean</font>

970
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this is the same problem any</font>

971
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,040
convention CA has there's no difference

972
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,320
here all the answers are things like CT

973
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,320
and replication or calling adam Langley

974
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,220
i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety google so we've just had a</font>

975
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,600
whole bunch of sites discovering you

976
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,040
shouldn't allow users to register user

977
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,770
names like administrator if you provide

978
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,090
them email access<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm also going to have</font>

979
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,590
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of sites realizing they</font>

980
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,500
shouldn't allow users to register the

981
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,810
name dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known can we require like</font>

982
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,810
a weird content type on this thing or

983
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:37,750
something that is going to be less

984
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,700
error-prone yeah so there's there's a

985
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,290
bunch of really technical discussions to

986
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,819
be had around the specifics of the

987
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,320
validation<font color="#CCCCCC"> nekkid against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll leave it</font>

988
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,930
yeah i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to capture the</font>

989
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,610
overall architecture here yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I I</font>

990
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,850
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be one of the places</font>

991
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:54,130
where we could get cab<font color="#CCCCCC"> forum to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

992
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:57,940
involved so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to have a</font>

993
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:00,640
definitive list of email addresses that

994
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,230
boneheads don't allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> common garden</font>

995
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,970
people to get and should be something

996
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is not an email</font>

997
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,149
validation mechanism in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document</font>

998
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,730
right now maybe we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> add one maybe</font>

999
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,930
now

1000
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,640
it's worth noting the cab form has been

1001
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on tightening down their list of</font>

1002
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,509
validation mechanisms so this will

1003
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,710
probably require some coordination with

1004
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,480
them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1005
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,460
whatever gets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pod remember we do</font>

1006
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,600
have a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion section so just</font>

1007
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,220
clarifying questions at this point

1008
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:28,319
please just very short domain names

1009
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,609
change ownership which would be good to

1010
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a mechanism that allows for</font>

1011
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,140
creating greater a domain name is

1012
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,180
authorized and potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> all writing</font>

1013
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,779
documentation yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the thing</font>

1014
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it's a really important point</font>

1015
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,490
that this is validates at a point in

1016
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,350
time and it may be useful to have some

1017
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:49,080
sort of reauthorization or scoping of

1018
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:52,319
authorization so force revalidation yeah

1019
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,680
next slide yes this is just summary of

1020
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall process you know you sign up</font>

1021
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your new registration if the ca</font>

1022
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,560
requires some sort of subscriber

1023
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,259
agreement it sends back<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL you</font>

1024
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,090
indicate your agreement then you request

1025
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,430
authorization for your domain the ca

1026
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:11,700
sends back challenges you respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1027
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:13,109
challenges and then you poll to see to

1028
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">see if your authorization is valid and</font>

1029
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:18,840
then once your valid you issue a

1030
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:21,390
certificate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1031
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,490
minimal as possible within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set of</font>

1032
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:26,220
use cases we wanted to require we wanted

1033
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support so any further clarifying</font>

1034
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,240
questions on the protocol as we have it

1035
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:37,290
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan harkens again is there a way</font>

1036
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,660
in this workflow to for the ca to

1037
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,850
specify what type of public key to for

1038
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">decline to generate and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSR to support</font>

1039
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:47,310
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking about ecdsa or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at DSA</font>

1040
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,840
or something like that so can he say

1041
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:54,590
make a key with the p34 we looked a

1042
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,120
curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1043
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,610
there's a couple mechanisms that I think

1044
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,650
we kicked around we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> drawn we were</font>

1045
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,180
drawing this up and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think either</font>

1046
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,040
of them is reflected<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the current</font>

1047
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,870
draft it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it would be</font>

1048
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">desirable to have the ca be able to</font>

1049
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:13,470
express basically the policies for what

1050
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:17,370
it will issue so covering key lengths

1051
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:20,330
key algorithms key and extensions it

1052
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,330
might allow or not allow

1053
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,910
we had thought about there's sort of two

1054
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,189
approaches to getting to that you could

1055
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,680
do it at the certificate request stage

1056
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,030
as by returning arrow types or someone

1057
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">requests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you don't like</font>

1058
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:36,120
or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have some sort of policy</font>

1059
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:37,799
publication mechanism as as an adjunct

1060
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,690
to the existing queries you've got here

1061
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's anything in the</font>

1062
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,300
document right now to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it</font>

1063
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,300
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be a good thing to add</font>

1064
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:54,450
other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks okay</font>

1065
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,850
folks so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 15 minutes for</font>

1066
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,430
discussion now and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two topics</font>

1067
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:02,400
the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two topics is really</font>

1068
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:06,210
around the work do people find this work

1069
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,950
and the scope that's been presented here

1070
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,600
interesting so far are there other use

1071
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,600
cases they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1072
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,050
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is for discussion I'm not</font>

1073
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,300
asking for a hum so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment</font>

1074
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:23,870
when if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to talk about the the</font>

1075
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,910
scope of the work etc you would get up

1076
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,500
Alex my over I absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> love this this</font>

1077
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,620
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much needed in the industry</font>

1078
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,600
because all the providers to deal with a

1079
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:39,770
lot of certificates it's a big hassle

1080
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,770
and there's a real real need for that

1081
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:48,840
hi Nick Sullivan<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudflare so I have a</font>

1082
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:48,840
question about this that is a little bit

1083
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:56,259
about the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this document itself</font>

1084
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,890
on acne is why was the decision may made

1085
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:02,490
to make the account key the

1086
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:05,560
authentication mechanism for getting

1087
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:07,779
certificates the main question I have

1088
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,850
about this is is that if you do have a

1089
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,410
wide deployment and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort of</font>

1090
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:15,040
cloud instances that you're spinning up

1091
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,330
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send this very sensitive</font>

1092
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,210
account key to each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

1093
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:24,430
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to get a machine from</font>

1094
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:26,200
it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely um so the assumption</font>

1095
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">was quite the contrary so maybe we've</font>

1096
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,339
messed this up but the idea was exactly

1097
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,840
to address that use case and the idea

1098
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">was that when the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Machine spin up they</font>

1099
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">would send their public keys to whatever</font>

1100
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:40,480
box intermediated the UM the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRs</font>

1101
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,860
through the box that we've had the

1102
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,630
account key and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would ask for and</font>

1103
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,680
that would ask for approval so if

1104
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,120
there's some I mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was</font>

1105
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,410
precisely to precisely to avoid the

1106
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,420
problem you're talking about so maybe

1107
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,759
it's bungled but that's the idea so if

1108
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:56,290
that's not working properly then we'd

1109
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,900
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it Phil hung back yeah I</font>

1110
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe what we should do is to</font>

1111
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:06,250
split the protocol into two and have an

1112
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">ACME direct and an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acne lra and describe</font>

1113
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:11,860
the two separately because connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1114
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,380
directly to the CA is one set of use

1115
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:18,430
cases connecting up through some

1116
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:20,350
intermediary<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is a different set</font>

1117
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:24,060
of issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably want to</font>

1118
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,060
separate that out and separate protocol

1119
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,430
so back might please

1120
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:42,330
given that why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just aggregate</font>

1121
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:45,210
everybody the front Mike please yeah I I

1122
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,370
think the battery's dead it's turned on

1123
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:52,460
but it's dead anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justin richer and</font>

1124
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:54,660
my question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for tuefel for all three</font>

1125
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,130
proposals so far is that I will very

1126
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,339
strongly get behind anybody that makes

1127
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:03,810
me never have to write a csr ever again

1128
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:06,870
and 2 i'd really like to see something

1129
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that us adopt an approach that will also</font>

1130
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:12,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">work for applications that just need a</font>

1131
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,859
bear key pair that don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CA and</font>

1132
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,920
assigning chain and all of this other

1133
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,560
stuff we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of applications</font>

1134
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> get by with publishing a JW k at an</font>

1136
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:31,020
kind of a hack but it works yeah but

1137
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:34,520
this would actually let me potentially

1138
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,520
distribute it and things like that so

1139

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe channeling yon from the</font>

about support for issuing wild card DV

00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a few people for whom that wouldn't work</font>

something that he deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think pointed</font>

1168
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,950
out when using the dns records but it's

1169
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,470
something that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should focus a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more because it's the biggest</font>

1172
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:03,810
which CA I want to get my services from

1173
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:07,410
and how to discover the different

1175
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,290
the fact that there might be Federation

1176
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,180
of types of CAS that I want the services

1177

from but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one I want I</font>

point but I let me let me up level that

1182
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,420
a little bit what I'm hearing is support

1183
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,899
for flexibility in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ca and support</font>

1186
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:42,360
quick comments and a question comment

1187
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,920
number one it answered your question I

1188
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,140
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very important problem</font>

1189
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm at number two I think it's a very</font>

1190
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:53,150
nicely constrained solution and comment

1191
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:56,580
number three is keep on going and

1192
00:49:53,150 --> 00:50:00,690
question is have a various CA vendors

1193
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:02,160
shunt risk well certainly let's encrypt

1194
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,260
is shown interest then I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1195
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,589
phil<font color="#CCCCCC"> has shown some interest we have</font>

something George moccasin I panic so I

1197
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:12,570
have a small number of comments in like

1198
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,430
sense to make without<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempting to</font>

1199
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,230
objectify any one individual what I

00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,120
believe I heard on entry was please

1201
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,220
preserve my bread business model and

1202
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns me because there are</font>

qualities in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> currency a business</font>

1204
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:26,370

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,350
wish to preserve so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to make</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i wanted to make is intermediaries are</font>

1208
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:35,940
somewhat concerning to me I understand

1209
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,950
the CA are a split but in effect we

1210
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,840
partly here because some intermediaries

1211
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,220
acted badly and issued certs we don't

1212
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,110
think should have existed so there are

1213
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,959
qualities and intermediaries that make

1214
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:48,330
me extremely uncomfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a third</font>

1215
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,520
comment slightly to one side<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am very</font>

1216
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:53,549
very concerned about the traction behind

1217
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,799
day I want deign to succeed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1218
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,449
a limited amount of clue

1219
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:58,549
the universe and if we divide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clue</font>

1220
00:50:56,449 --> 00:51:01,189
into this room in the dining room before

1221
00:50:58,549 --> 00:51:03,380
Dane is complete we won't get Dane I

1222
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:06,049
need Dane modules in browsers I need

1223
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,150
Dane modules in systems Dane is very

1224
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:10,160
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the reasons Dane is</font>

1225
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,199
important is because it gets rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1226
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a business model which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1227
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:17,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">main goals so I'm slightly concerned</font>

1228
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:19,160
about aspects of this project having

1229
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:24,049
said which I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a really cute</font>

1230
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:25,879
model hey that's that let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let the</font>

1231
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:27,890
let the<font color="#E5E5E5"> record state that 52 minutes</font>

1232
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,779
into an hour buff were already concerned

1233
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,569
about a crisis of success which i think

1234
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:36,079
is rather quick work on it our long and

1235
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:37,819
non working group forming<font color="#CCCCCC"> above it's the</font>

1236
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:42,109
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> we shouldn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this because it</font>

1237
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:45,019
might disrupt the Dane business model<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1238
00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:47,209
so uh let's let's close the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

1239
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:49,758
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecker because I have another</font>

1240
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:51,979
question to ask the room but Richard so

1241
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:53,630
three quick points on the question of

1242
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:55,669
separation where there's a need for an

1243
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,489
explicit delegated model or two

1244
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,079
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> flavors delegated and direct I</font>

1245
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:02,179
think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

1246
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">question of whether acne could be used</font>

1247
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:06,499
and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to back fashion where</font>

1248
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:09,199
an end client does<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain flavor of</font>

1249
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:11,390
acne with the CA and then the ca does

1250
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:14,299
are with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA and then the RA does</font>

1251
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:16,098
another flavor of acne with the CI if I

1252
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,839
think that it may just be a profiling

1253
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:20,179
exercise to look at what you need in

1254
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,390
each of those cases second on the

1255
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:24,890
question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wildcards I will say that's</font>

1256
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:27,920
among<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top questions I've gotten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1257
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,808
people since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been involved in</font>

1258
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,009
what's encrypt projects so it's probably

1259
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,179
something when working group is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1261
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:38,689
whether the different what validation

1262
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,459
methods might be appropriate to that and

1263
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:42,879
what the security considerations should

1264
00:52:40,459 --> 00:52:44,689
be around the issuance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wildcards</font>

1265
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,579
ultimately is probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

1266
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:48,558
down to operational decisions by cas

1267
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:50,329
using this interface but it's worth to

1268
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,640
think at least having some discussion in

1269
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:55,779
the working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last point on</font>

1270
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,118
Dane I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

1271
00:52:55,779 --> 00:53:03,380
supportive technology for Dane in the

1272
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:05,359
sense that it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the potential to</font>

1273
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:08,239
interact really well and be a use case

for DNS SEC in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense of using DNS</font>

willing to help improve that because i

1294
00:53:57,979 --> 00:54:03,529
would cry with joy if we could get one

that would be fantastic ever yeah but I

00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:01,900

the browser browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> and other clients</font>

1324

accept certificates and nothing else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1325
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,820
this is about allowing people to talk to

00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:39,279
those browsers securely as much as

1327

possible on as far as on as far as Dane

1328
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,080
goes on honestly I think that the

analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was offered there's</font>

actually put<font color="#E5E5E5"> you backwards um so on that</font>

1334
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because there are no</font>

1335
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:00,760

1336

1337
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,370
practically no clients and because

1338
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,480
there's no and because because

1339
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,500
practically no one offers damn there's

1340
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,390
no incentive for the clients to

1341
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:12,490
accepting and so um what one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Acme</font>

1342
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:14,379
and in general automatic issuance offers

1343
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:16,810
the possibility to break that log jam by

1344
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving you a valuable reason to detain</font>

1345
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,710
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody accepts it to use for to use</font>

1346
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,810
as a stronger form of issuance and also

1347
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,090
to allow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy it in certificate</font>

1348
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,230
while only some small fraction of people

1349
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">accept Dane in the rest except</font>

1350
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:30,370
certificates so as Richard said this is

1351
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,080
a bridge universal<font color="#E5E5E5"> day deployment and in</font>

1352
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:33,310
fact back to the only scenario I've ever

1353
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,860
understood where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get browser</font>

1354
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:38,140
based in deployment on from 0 to 100

1355
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,490
almond or any plausible scenario so

1356
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,509
quite the contrary I think if you want

1357
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,700
if you like getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be</font>

1358
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:47,710
excited about on universal automatic

1359
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:49,120
issuance not happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I know the</font>

1360
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,280
area director was going to send me some

1361
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,330
questions to ask and I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> got them so</font>

1362
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,100
i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask some different</font>

1363
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,049
questions almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly and then turn</font>

1364
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:59,830
the microphone to him for the the last

1365
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:02,890
thing how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the room are</font>

1366
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:04,900
either have currently read the draft or

1367
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:09,910
intend to after<font color="#E5E5E5"> having seen today's</font>

1368
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:12,280
presentations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good forgive</font>

1369
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:15,430
the bad language so shocked i have the

1370
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,980
vapors now how how many people in the

1371
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,410
room are either already on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Acme</font>

1372
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:28,660
mailing list or intend to join<font color="#CCCCCC"> it after</font>

1373
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:31,270
today's presentations<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright how many</font>

1374
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the room currently believe</font>

1375
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:40,000
that this is so complete and baked they

1376
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:41,560
don't need to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michael Richardson</font>

1377
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,290
and Jeff Houston were the only hands I

1378
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,330
saw oh no there's one more in the corner

1379
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,529
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three very trusting people</font>

1380
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,779
and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some</font>

1381
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,250
work to do here otherwise I assume

1382
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're not reading the drafts and doing</font>

1383
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:57,610
the joining the mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font>

1384
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,760
think what I'm hearing I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to risk</font>

1385
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:02,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 22</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hums this is not a working</font>

1386
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,810
group forming buff so this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1387
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:06,670
sense of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room how many of you think</font>

1388
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's work here for the ITF</font>

1389
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,930
please hum now

1390
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:18,680
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there is no work</font>

1391
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:20,180
here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF please on that okay</font>

1392
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,890
that was funny but I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the hum</font>

1393
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,660
again because the laughter over wrote it

1394
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:28,069
if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no work here for</font>

1395
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:30,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ITF please come now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one one</font>

1396
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:32,180
person near a microphone something<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1397
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,890
so the last words will go to our

1398
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:35,720
esteemed area director to see what

1399
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:39,440
questions he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had me ask that</font>

1400
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't those those were good I guess I</font>

1401
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:48,140
I only have one further question I guess

1402
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:50,390
so I think the plan here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there</font>

1403
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,609
seems to be people willing to do this it

1404
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:54,740
seems I think there should be agreement

1405
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:56,060
there's nothing to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and so I</font>

1406
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,370
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question is whether we should</font>

1407
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,660
just go ahead and do it from former you

1408
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,000
know get start getting people writing a

1409
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,859
charter maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next week's put</font>

1410
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,320
in the next month or two or whether we

1411
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,840
should have another buff before we do

1412
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,100
that so how many how many people would

1413
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,470
be so I what I want to know is our

1414
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">people okay with that plan so it so if</font>

1415
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:18,080
the plan the plan is to let's say with

1416
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,760
the plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just go ahead and form a</font>

1417
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,430
working group do the charger on the

1418
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,790
charging on the list and so on in a

1419
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:30,129
month<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two I'm very much in favor of</font>

1420
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:33,650
that plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you want to call it</font>

1421
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:35,210
Adam<font color="#E5E5E5"> Langley</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google so so the ITF does</font>

1422
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,580
have a tendency<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take things and take</font>

1423
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,720
a really long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then come up with</font>

1424
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,640
something that's slightly different from

1425
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">what used in practice so the reason why</font>

1426
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,180
i hummed against having the IETF to do

1427
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,270
something here was that I hope let's

1428
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:49,850
encrypts like spit out of working CA

1429
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:51,770
shortly and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the IETF were to</font>

1430
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,150
standardize something that wasn't what

1431
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,520
they were using and wasn't what the

1432
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:57,770
world was using which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite possible</font>

1433
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,650
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sad outcome there</font>

1434
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:03,680
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at what time we</font>

1435
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">have we just hit our time ok so the mic</font>

1436
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,720
line is closed and so so speaking

1437
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:10,280
visually plastic creeper my

1438
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,689
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen Chris posture is is</font>

1439
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,180
that we intend to spit something out

1440
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:16,400
prior to ITF standardization and would

1441
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,470
hope to harmonize the IETF as long as it

1442
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,690
was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to radically different insanely</font>

1443
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:22,640
cell which I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best</font>

1444
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,480
outcome in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world on but we'd also</font>

1445
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,190
don't think

1446
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,480
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than pleased to</font>

1447
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">people just adopt it whatever the hell</font>

1448
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:36,800
we get ok so we're bracket euro is it

1449
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:38,930
very quick yeah quickly skimming the

1450
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,760
drafts it looks close enough to baked if

1451
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,430
we don't need a working group this can

1452
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,470
be nuttin as an 80 sponsor draft with

1453
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:48,440
all the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can get it</font>

1454
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:56,209
about the point on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list I don't think</font>

1455
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">I agree ok and so ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

1456
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,180
home now if you think just going ahead

1457
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,160
and forming a roping group in a couple

1458
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,480
of months is a reasonable thing so if

1459
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:07,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a reasonable plan home</font>

1460
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:12,500
now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a reasonable</font>

1461
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan please on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>
