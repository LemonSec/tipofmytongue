design team to summarize<font color="#E5E5E5"> the available</font>

48
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,020
publication a model the reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

49
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,229
because in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting some people</font>

51
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:17,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canada model can be using model un</font>

52
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:21,120
designs CFM model so we've owned this

53
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">design team and we so here the contents</font>

54
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,530
of slides container for<font color="#CCCCCC"> parties oh the</font>

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">code and object to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a team</font>

56
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:36,119
secondly is related to the design team

57
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,250
meeting discussion points and then serve

58
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,820
God is the summary design team are

59
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:47,370
listed is the discussion I think there's

60
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:52,200
some some issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the list of</font>

61
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:55,950
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid kid too that's cotton</font>

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">pony from the 90 meeting so last time we</font>

63
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:02,400
would show the contribution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate</font>

64
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:06,150
Holly for her next so what's the

65
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">objective and goal for this design team</font>

66
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:13,020
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sense for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rule to see the</font>

67
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion we kick out the design team</font>

68
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,510
worker I start to try to answer these

69
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,070
two questions the first person so what

70
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,630
degree the choice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nine model</font>

71
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,370
impact

72
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:31,440
on the nine Walker at second is the

73
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:35,370
night mode of be developed as a model

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,440
agnostic here we want to stress not

75
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,690
working who is not a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop</font>

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,940
any new OEM vertical we only focus on a

77
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,969
developer new<font color="#CCCCCC"> low end model so it is oh</font>

78
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,310
and model region we may introduce some

79
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,770
new objects and we identified that

80
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:54,390
comment to the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noah technology</font>

81
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:57,000
next so we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three design team</font>

82
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:02,280
meeting in the first technology meeting

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,350
way here we we summarize the key point

84
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,299
we discussed the food on Google what are

85
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,240
Canada Mortimer can use databases<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,240
common elements we can sort out from

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,080
various web<font color="#E5E5E5"> program technology and</font>

88
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:19,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether om limewater</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support a</font>

89
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,729
connection or rain or creation list and

90
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:30,110
and how dense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can still provide</font>

91
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:33,570
the operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs next so based on our</font>

92
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,790
investigation we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

93
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:40,409
here why is actually save a model

94
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:44,790
another wise activity without 72 1731

95
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:49,110
model and and in a food they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

96
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,630
also using safe mode of the places and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

97
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,360
folder and chaos GGO ma using the

98
00:07:51,630 --> 00:08:00,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">Whitewater 7231 as a basis so we</font>

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:06,780
basically we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> only to handle for</font>

100
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:09,390
line model next so<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

101
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">model with the white or 17 so the wire</font>

102
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,630
model and we can see the difference

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,450
seven model may focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

104
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">but a white audit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> empty was simpler 31</font>

106
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:26,000
hostess about a fourth amendment and

107
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,960
compare the terminology using the in cm

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,090
and a white or the 1731 we can see they

109
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:39,039
have the equivalent the terminology used

110
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:41,810
in different<font color="#E5E5E5"> contexts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ujiri operation</font>

112
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:48,579
regarding one question the kujoo clarify

113
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:53,510
the terminology of a different meaning

114
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,800
definition for model year since in a few

115
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,500
tries is kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mixture of the</font>

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,680
architecture where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we or the mag map</font>

117
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,560
and the other way other<font color="#CCCCCC"> words its</font>

118
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,930
functionalities so please clarify what

119
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,489
do you mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> mother here succubus here</font>

120
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,510
we just as the way they exist in the

121
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:20,210
model so tamilok terminology we didn't

122
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,990
change in a meeting of the existing

123
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,730
definitional terminology you know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

124
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,900
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so now</font>

125
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,660
suppose that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

126
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,270
candidate model can be using for the

127
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,610
line worker and then we identify the

128
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:40,130
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> enemy so other word the</font>

129
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,850
clarifying in the next slide what common

130
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,850
items we saw how

131
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:56,439
okay next next here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common function</font>

132
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:59,519
summarizing FC 7276 they actually

133
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:05,110
summarize a lot of comments on change

134
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:09,759
amount i do an MP also in eft<font color="#CCCCCC"> imma chill</font>

see we<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass discovering the most men are</font>

137
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,359
common function so we can use in these

00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:27,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">this comment on as a basis to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

139
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:33,100
non model next I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

140
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:38,589
second to examine that charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay come</font>

141
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:41,379
back with questions on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> later so so</font>

142
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:44,319
basically discussion on a survey we will

143
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:46,569
identify the following common elements

144
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:49,179

we can slaughter both organs want<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

162
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">no next how can I model can be can</font>

163
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,939
simplify the operation costs that we

164
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,950
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> children's and the pros ratings</font>

165
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,700
because we use in their<font color="#CCCCCC"> call Nicole</font>

166
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,470
moves a transaction to the device so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

167
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:04,010
maximum complexity can be greatly

168
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:06,410
reduced next the second reason because

169
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:10,640
the operational management network is

170
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:13,250
very limited when we require when across

171
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,199
multiple technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

172
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,440
respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a layer boundaries so Who am</font>

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:24,200
message should not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> geek</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of Hungary</font>

174
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:26,720
within a layer so when we do the Edwin

175
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,800
pass troubleshooting and it's very

176
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,810
challenging because the internet pacify

177
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,500
my core network a settlement with each

178
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:40,819
terms may support a different technology

179
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:49,070
next so with the nine model how we can

180
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:51,140
symbolize the operation costs next so

181
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,240
how does lime solve this problem of

182
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,589
leaking from different layers i mean how

183
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,690
it is different from what is today I

184
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,740
mean you have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> layers already</font>

185
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,529
so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the networks are working as is</font>

186
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,529
so how it is different can you please

187
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,529
explain

188
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,189
drive around here with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 model</font>

189
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,850
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> never Chavez shooting with each</font>

190
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:18,969
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> never secondly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can be wrong</font>

191
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,370
separate living with your all of the

192
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,290
layer boundary and it has a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

193
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,790
he would send a recording a consistent

194
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,219
way to the national system so imagine

195
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,349
system can do it through the magical job

196
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,389
to staging different layer to imaging

197
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:36,699
that but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> double shooting allows in</font>

198
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,189
different layers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> soak informed and</font>

199
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:41,500
that entry end and an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

200
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:44,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">chopper shooting okay maybe it's not</font>

201
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,910
yeah it's not clear maybe Gail maybe

202
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,019
later slides make it clear it's not

203
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,399
clear how this will solve the problem

204
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,199
I'm of leaking because I mean as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

205
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,540
layers are today they are already there

206
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,300
if we can solve the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> today I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

207
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,180
so maybe I guess your slides may have

208
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,889
have a explanation later at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

209
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,769
it's not clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me how this will solve</font>

210
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:10,329
it yeah this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> some you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> race that</font>

211
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you had announced a meeting but you know</font>

212
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,769
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks there is another</font>

213
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,949
clarify how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you see me by the</font>

214
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,899
parking costs because you want to have

215
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:23,258
clear collab occasion for days and I

216
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you you need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Sochi is</font>

217
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:27,990
covered you need to bring line model

218
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,620
altitude and then we can

219
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:34,589
how in support is the teacher III think

220
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm I I think it's a good idea I'm not</font>

221
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,899
I'm you know overall but I'm just saying

222
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:43,079
is the arguments which you are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

223
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,630
not not fully convinced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those are</font>

224
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,360
the arguments you know you know it is

225
00:14:45,630 --> 00:15:00,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">overall probably it will maybe help I</font>

226
00:14:48,360 --> 00:15:03,060
guess so second did not he actually

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">cancelled at the sex for grab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operator</font>

228
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,890
providing speak initial version of the

229
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:13,560
OEM comparison so it's an air up here om

230
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:18,209
90s over and just kikyo and pft and we

231
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:22,319
sort out some common function next so

232
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:25,500
this is people provide by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> greg and</font>

233
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,100
we can see for the RP and archaea

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,380
jiangsu actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> men tennis anyone and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hence the intermediate on implicit her</font>

236
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,529
supportive also we can see for the

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:41,030
proactive and annuity of everything

238
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:46,100
another 45 rton

239
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:48,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">bye happy and JSON so but uh although we</font>

240
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,280
can see this table we can see a lot of

241
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,430
common function we discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

242
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,069
perfect previous slides like a full

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:06,560
comment test point<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we using given</font>

244
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:09,020
terminology here next so in a certain

245
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,739
Atlantean meeting we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a lot</font>

of debate on colonists and the rocky oen

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,950

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:22,610
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> time standing yes Xavier motor is</font>

249
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,350
undefined but the line model<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed</font>

250
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,840
the unit is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> joke actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tried in a</font>

251
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:31,610
sec should fail the cable so we give

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:35,840
some argument the free number were you

256
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,970
give to the ravages of testing point we

257
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:56,530
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy this so bread though so maybe</font>

258
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:58,970
we need to update the line model

259
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,720
proposing that he's a chapter to make

260
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,480
sure the the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> model from where</font>

261
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,980
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> akio an otherwise we need he</font>

262
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,610
proposed maybe we'll have a separate

<font color="#CCCCCC">nature is document up here oh and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

264
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:18,010
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need us working chair of this</font>

265
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:27,939
because in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter we only have one</font>

266
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:29,800
time to the line model necklace so

267
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's a summary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the discussion</font>

you accusing our honorees in this OEM

272

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,660
identify some who am required by the

most of em rapunzel is beta flavoring

275
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,210
comments about how these will come to

of some teach I mean they don't choose a

model extension technologies especially

287
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:33,250
more extension so we roughly up worrying

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,879
with non-motor should be she would set

293
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:53,520
oh and technology and I think we

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,080
and other we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can define until you give</font>

also editor of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kiev TX h our draft</font>

323
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:52,930
reactor 12 and my solution for all I'm

324
00:20:49,460 --> 00:21:00,020
is that maybe the commonality between

325
00:20:52,930 --> 00:21:03,230
IPO are ibps OEM and ethernet aps om

326
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:06,490
supima hobby it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more clarified</font>

327
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:10,370
as we pointed out the previous right

328
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:13,280
since we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> there 120 architecture or</font>

329
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:16,939
motel or already we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very very</font>

330
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,570
stable models architecture also defined

331
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:25,550
in the draft round or gap analysis here

332
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:31,010
so maybe and my solution is we have more

333
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:32,870
study or ip-based om<font color="#CCCCCC"> the we should find</font>

337
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:45,350
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my solution to the I'm working</font>

338
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,850
group circuit I think you talked about

339
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,280
the layer manager I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

340
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:56,510
identify some elements the common

341
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:59,540
elements like that can be defining a

342
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,030
base model you can bring up again and

343
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:08,080
later they want to and we have already

344
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:12,139
under clear the model how<font color="#CCCCCC"> trees and</font>

345

348
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,940
harder

349
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,780
trying to the more information model<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

350
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> common architectures and here we are</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be the good inputs to the lamb</font>

355

limited to the bay area there 12 so the

356
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:50,690
program is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with the layer</font>

362

should be more discussed and we should

363
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:24,080
find out what to do here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

364
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:26,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">a single i think last item we got a</font>

365
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,159
comment that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> only look into</font>

idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> him no other layer</font>

367
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:44,300
but I please state your names at the mic

368
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:49,520
so you can regular skate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erickson yes I</font>

369
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:56,870
understand that their interest to do

370
00:23:49,520 --> 00:24:00,420
generic OEM model of everything but is

371
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:06,379
probably first we need to develop model

372
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:10,260
for ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM or technologies that ITF</font>

373
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:16,320
created and has access and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

374
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:19,170
work with their MAF<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli itu to try</font>

375
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:26,429
to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because before we start flying</font>

376
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:33,600
we need to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working that was the</font>

377
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:36,090
Russian it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> my summer on the</font>

378
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,699
Greeks point and maybe and we have a lot

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of difference and the defining itu-t or</font>

380
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,850
when a 4-under maybe I should be sought

381
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,820
yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is I dear boy what is I</font>

382
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">think um and maybe ip-based ome the baby</font>

383
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:55,070
key elements for the order this is Maya

384
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:59,460
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my command here thank you</font>

385
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the car</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infinera so actually I had</font>

386
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,720
a similar question so if we're just

387
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,560
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one layer so I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

388
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:11,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually go across have a</font>

389
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,649
generic model multiple layers which is

390
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,160
great right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe you can you know to</font>

391
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:19,200
call come up with a month you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

392
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,210
functionality and maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can apply</font>

393
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,700
different layers right so it would be

394
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,130
great I'd yet but looks like just

395
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,800
limiting yourself to the scope to the IP

396
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:32,630
layer so then it's actually is very

397
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,629
narrow I don't see a value then

398
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:46,630
I was not clear enough not I p

399
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:51,690
particular but technologies that IDF the

400
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">god so it will be drill at IP its mpls</font>

401
00:25:51,690 --> 00:26:02,950
mpls-tp but will not go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethernet or</font>

402
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:04,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">otn or TDM or wavelength switching</font>

403
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">because these technologies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

404
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,550
controlled by other standard defining

405
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,390
organizations it is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

406
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,639
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them on realigning and we'll</font>

407
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,470
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at their model but i</font>

408
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,410
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are many organizations</font>

409
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:24,160
for example i may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined therein</font>

410
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:26,410
model for the carrier ethernet so we

411
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:32,770
would not try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redefine the model for</font>

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so but not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less speaking as the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility here it would help people</font>

414
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,330
if they would read the Charter right

415
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,700
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Charter is very clear okay</font>

416
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:47,080
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me do it this in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me</font>

417
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:49,480

421

developed outside of the ITF full<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

422
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,380
now it does not mean and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did</font>

423
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,950
rightly in design team that we should

424
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,410
not look at CFM or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU one to have</font>

425
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,470
like a consistent analogy to get

426
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,680
consistent model to start with that's a

427
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,420
big difference the second reason why

428
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">people should be the Charter is the</font>

429
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:22,210
third blood pounder is lying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

430
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:28,930
define a new OEM protocol get guidance

431
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:32,620
the Charter says the working group will

432
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:35,010
not develop any new OEM protocols for

433

solve them let me read the Charter

437

439
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,710

is fine right but it's only limited to

448
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:43,220

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:27,080
examples of the data planes and the OEM

463
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:32,240
technologies that the working group will

464
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,999
consider in scope I just uh none battled

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:38,339
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is to some extent clouding</font>

483
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,229
your vision in terms of the picture you

484
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:44,099
should be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at no to give an</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are currently published facing</font>

487
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:51,359
things on like CFM type terminologies

488
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:56,099
which again makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are well</font>

489
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:57,089
specified but as an example it

490
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,668
constrains you're thinking about

491
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:04,019
maintenance domains maintenance domains

492
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:05,729
in those technologies are I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

493
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,309
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> small world for what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf</font>

494
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:09,959
technologies tend to cover because if

495
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:11,339
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the biggest</font>

496
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:13,439
maintenance domain that tends to be

497
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:16,458
specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> these technologies it's</font>

498
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:19,499
basically a pair of service providers

499
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:21,059
IETF has potentially chains of inter

500
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:24,059
domain service providers that we're

501

<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do away Emma and please let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

502
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,979
make a few points Creek and they're not

503
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,979
happy to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

504
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:38,980
so so that is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to make</font>

505
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:41,559
is that my suggestion is well starting

506
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the lower layer text and you know</font>

507
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,780
their analysis is a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

508
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:49,420
thinking don't constrain yourself to

509
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:52,299
that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure to think bigger from the</font>

510
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:56,260
day one the second thing I would say is

511
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:58,210
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be covering a little bit</font>

512
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:01,690
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the details of the existing IETF</font>

513
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:04,840
technologies is no Greg pointed out part

514
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem we have here is that IETF</font>

515
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,030
technologies have not been designed with

516
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,299
OEM built in from day one as other text

517
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:15,520
it's just a legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the IETF so we</font>

518
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:17,440
have technologies that are usable for

519
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,900
some components of a way up<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not</font>

520
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite the same thing you need to make</font>

521
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,240
sure those you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a start to how</font>

522
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,740
they're listed that's good one of the

523
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,049
pieces that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing this is my third</font>

534
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,250
test ad and how then at that point

535
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,470
enumerate once you've discovered the

536
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,380
component what the tests are that you

537
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,900
can do and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point you now have</font>

538
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,760
the start of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model of saying if I want</font>

539
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to test this and I have no I know what</font>

540
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,520
the test I know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is here is my</font>

541
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,390
API or protocol that I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

542
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,389
cause the test two

543
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:30,480
Greg mercy Erickson<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay couple things</font>

544
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:32,549
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to note Jeff think it's very</font>

545
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,870
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's interesting</font>

546
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:43,408
perspective so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

547
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:48,268
model that is CFM 1731 mpls-tp trail

548
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:50,970
that has explicit notion of maidens

549
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:56,909
domain so the maintenance domain can

550
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:59,879
have multiple providers so what what it

551
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,830
has has layers so layers can give you

552
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:06,840
different scope within the same domain

553
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:10,529
the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is not part of IP</font>

554
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:14,069
or I p.m. pls for a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

555
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:17,220
that's a big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have concerned</font>

556
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:20,040
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how to correlate that implicit</font>

557
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,980
versus explicit and that's what we had a

558
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,000
discussion in our design<font color="#CCCCCC"> team that</font>

559
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,589
whether we can bridge this difference or

560
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,060
might be we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what we</font>

561
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:34,020
talked about and that's what we are

562
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:37,020
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group to work with us</font>

563
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:41,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">and think about it is do we need to</font>

564
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:44,849
build our explicit IPO am data model

565
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:49,020
that will have explicit domains and

566
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:52,470
layers and map identities and then it

567
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:57,619
will be more core so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> built IPO</font>

568
00:34:52,469 --> 00:35:00,899
am model in similar to what we have in

569
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:03,359
CFM and the rest and then we can

570
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:09,290
generalize but at least build something

571
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,290
data model<font color="#CCCCCC"> and data model for their OEM</font>

572
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:16,230
entities so and then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that after we</font>

573
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,230
deals there for

574
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,859
oh yeah model then we can start working

575
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:26,280
about the layers and do the correlation

576
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:28,980
discovery and they're exercising of

577
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,400
their OEM functions whether it's

578
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,830
proactive or on demand and that's

579
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,010
something that chin suggested and what

580
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:40,140
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are entertaining is that the other</font>

581
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,109
thing might be either it will be a part

582
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:47,629
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this exercise in our effort or it</font>

583
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:50,369
might be what we can only do is defect

584
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:54,690
characterization<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent across</font>

585
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:58,890
different at different data planes

586
00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:01,609
because then this everything and whether

587
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,930
it belongs in a certain management the

588
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:07,490
maintenance domain or it's just

589
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:11,339
characterized by IP address it becomes a

590
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:16,729
technology specific and can be hidden in

591
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:19,109
a container under some localization name

592
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:23,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's something that we're</font>

593
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:31,170
really discussing very intensely and we

594
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:33,980
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a conclusion on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

595
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:37,500
we're saying roughly the same thing yeah

596
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:40,410
I ethic but I'm encouraging the group is

597
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically design team is as you</font>

598
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,129
think of these things you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

599
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,440

604
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:00,420

<font color="#CCCCCC">digitally TDM writing over that ok if</font>

612
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,560
you pick some of the joke t-shirts or

613
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,480
gigantic stacks of stuff that we've seen

614
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,880
over the years that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing</font>

615
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is really the sort of challenge</font>

616
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font>

617

is the largest maintenance domains that

those technologies suggest to you

619
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,779
potentially are very small by comparison

620
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,860
to the messes that customers really

621
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:40,050
build for themselves and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

622
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:42,690
that you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

623
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,460

624
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,460
but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think for what</font>

625
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,890
the big problem is and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've spent</font>

626
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,830
much time worrying about no existing

627
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,390
terminology worrying about you know what

628
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">is considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintence domain for</font>

purposes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> new layer to technologies</font>

630
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,319
and don't start thinking what you call

00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:05,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next bigger thing that is an IP</font>

632
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,230
thing that rides on top of Cecily you

633
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,430
potentially trap yourself into the point

634
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,550
of trying to build something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

635
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:14,310
trying to do Oh am at something that's

636
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,260
too small you'll eventually want to

637
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,390
discover that once you've gotten certain

638
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,460
level of testing but no so if you've no

639
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,720
gotten two layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your LSP down and</font>

640
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,750
you've discovered that that's where your

641
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,299
problem is at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a further</font>

642
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,970
topology discovery bottle for mpls may

643
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,530
suggest to you that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a layer one</font>

644
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,980
optical element that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

645
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:37,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">retrieve those some no stats from that's</font>

646
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,380
great but first<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to figure out</font>

647
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know the top level</font>

648
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,650
component and all the service level

649
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,800
components that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing on top of</font>

650
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:49,530
so you need to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a vocabulary</font>

651
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,020
bigger than what's be given to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

652
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,420
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that to be able to say what</font>

653
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,630
am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address if I can cut off</font>

654
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the night just a second we're running a</font>

655
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,630
little bit short on time we only have 20

656
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes left I'd like you to finish your</font>

657
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,380
presentation then we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

658
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,420
steps of that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go there</font>

659
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,450
does anybody have to not sign the blue

660
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:16,410
sheets yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we know where the blue</font>

661
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,120
sheets are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good okay if you could</font>

662
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,720
finish the presentation I think you have

663
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,770
one more slide yeah actually reach other

664
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,629
conclusion actually

665
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:35,250
I agree the commonality between the mpls

666
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:37,440
OMG<font color="#CCCCCC"> OMFG i think the bottom line is for</font>

667
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,200
the IP layer lime mode of congregation

668
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,140
model doesn't it doesn't need to be

669
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,960
supported but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a belayer can using the</font>

670
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,310
lamb order to provide a consistent

671
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:53,040
reporting and we're doesn't hate

672
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:55,620
reputation we<font color="#CCCCCC"> singhalese some graphical</font>

673
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,000
concerns when we discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

674
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:04,650
corrected and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> day is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we talked</font>

675
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,090
about some disagreement I think we have

676
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:12,470
already discussed them so I don't need

677
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:15,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go go to the last page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

678
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,709
either open up the mic for more comments

679
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:19,590
or talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps of the</font>

680
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:29,520
working group anymore comments on the

681
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:31,650
person yes microphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm from the</font>

682
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">character new to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the group so I didn't</font>

683
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what by board but I think the next</font>

684
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">step should be something about</font>

685
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,550
requirements not data modern there's

686
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,529
tons of groups doing the guy already

687
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to agree i was about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

688
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,620
something about that so I guess we've

689
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,940
opened up the part about next step so if

690
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,130
you want you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a seat or you can</font>

691
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,970
stay stay standing if you like if you

692
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to chime in the requirements is</font>

693
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:59,220
very clear in the Charter we just want

694
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,110
to provide a consists in the recording

695
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,240
congregation renovation I think they

696
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,160
said only refundable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so maybe you</font>

697
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,439
can do gap analysis with current data

698
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,299
models and provide recommendation to

699
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,910
them this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what luck to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

700
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,930
model that not satisfy how<font color="#E5E5E5"> yous guys out</font>

701
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,930
there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

702
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,920
usually people jump to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

703
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,930
quick and not need that but we need

704
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,880
solution to be problem statement

705
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,620
requirement best practice they declare

706
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,440
what not working didn't care about what

707
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:34,109
a great extension is too many data

708
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,780
models and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on conflicting on his</font>

709
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:41,190
problems we respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think we</font>

710
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:48,030
need God<font color="#CCCCCC"> then one too many data models</font>

711
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:50,910
in traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're here then one so</font>

712
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,590
if i try to summarize the request if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

713
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:58,049
try to summarize we've been doing you

714
00:41:52,590 --> 00:42:02,850
looked at two models to start with itu

715
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:05,610
one and the CFM one now you came to the

716
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:08,670
conclusion that you had somehow the same

717
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:12,500
technology right you came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

718
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:18,870
conclusion that yet the same companies

719
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:20,640
right so do i understand that basically

720
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:23,040
it doesn't matter which<font color="#CCCCCC"> one you select</font>

721
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,990
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have something</font>

722
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:31,230
consistent regardless is this the

723
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:36,330
conclusion i think a base we identified

724
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:39,600
i think after as 72cm second to provide

725
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,850
a common functionality also we base our

726
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:46,020
allocated we sing calm they have some

727
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:48,330
common elements we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we</font>

728
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,670
can summarize the risk an image into the

729
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">common temperature just like a photo</font>

730
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:57,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">domain tester</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point purchasing and</font>

731
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology type RPC I think these with</font>

732
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,380
all the common elements when we compare

733
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,288
staffing model and why<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar 7231 so i</font>

734
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,130
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure we should repeat</font>

735
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:12,549
to do with Kim correct me if i'm wrong i

736
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,749
remember in the design team mailing list

737
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:18,650
somebody proposing that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

738
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:20,709
model agnostic and I think that was was

739
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:24,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final consensus of the group</font>

740
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:26,419
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think my model actually is that</font>

741
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">object generic model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we were</font>

742
00:43:26,419 --> 00:43:32,989
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the motor to map it into the</font>

743
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:36,140
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer we so I think it should</font>

744
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:38,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">be divided as economic state what does</font>

745
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it mean mother agnostic it means if I</font>

746
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:44,869
understand this that whatever I tu or

747
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,699
CFM it doesn't matter because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

748
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:50,599
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same elements is this what you mean</font>

749
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:53,059
by model agnostic yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

750
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,609
moment slightly different names so

751
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:57,049
basically the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is what that</font>

752
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,969
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on this young model</font>

753
00:43:57,049 --> 00:44:02,089
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to use those those</font>

754
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:04,939
common components and technology and

755
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,759
just do the young model yeah that's what

756
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:09,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">I suggest I think we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

757
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:12,979
sufficient a common elements to<font color="#CCCCCC"> style</font>

758
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:15,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">welcome and if you have any identify and</font>

759
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:20,239
a new common elements awakened<font color="#E5E5E5"> I jesse's</font>

760
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:21,890
in basic data model I think alright so

761
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,709
the next question then in terms of next

762
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:27,019
steps so in the first meeting last time

763
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:29,719
there was like the draft from<font color="#CCCCCC"> tisa that</font>

764
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:32,089
was using CFM there was some pushback on

765
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:33,380
the terminology right so now you're

766
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling me lithography is the same</font>

767
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,089
whatever model we choose so is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

768
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:40,759
the next logical thing you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

769
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:44,509
use or is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we are using say Adam</font>

770
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:48,679
lighten model<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually we try to make</font>

771
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:57,080
an imaginary<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way we move technologies</font>

772
00:44:48,679 --> 00:45:01,520
specific information out so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

773
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:11,529
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have a different</font>

774
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:18,290
opinion on ability and model<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I bnib</font>

775
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:20,600
mpls ldp based so what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

776
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:24,680
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new document with some</font>

777
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:28,549
changes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably we can say</font>

778
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,020
whether it's applicable right very good

779
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,900
so what i'm drinking extracting the

780
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,480
group here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what is missing you</font>

781
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,370
know and whether design team has done

782
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,350
his job and you have to thank the design

783
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:43,160
team right that's what I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

784
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:44,750
extract if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could weigh in here as you</font>

785
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">know as an individual contributor this</font>

786
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:52,540
time there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two next steps that I say</font>

787
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:55,160
the first is that there was troubling

788
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,840
confusion about what the working group

789
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,370
is doing and what it isn't doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

790
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,260
what its modeling and what it's not

791
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:02,720
modeling and even how these young models

792
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,150
are used there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very enlightening</font>

793
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,779
conversation between Greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mirsky and</font>

794
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,860
Jeff house it would be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that</font>

795
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,040
conversation could be captured in a

796
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:15,920
five-page informational draft so we have

797
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,840
clear clarity about what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the</font>

798
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,700
second thing which i think is enough to

799
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,060
finish what the working group is doing

800
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:26,600
is to complete the yang model that we

801
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just agreed we needed now the issue here</font>

802
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,960
is we received email from tissot a while

803
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,700
back saying that his job

804
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,820
responsibilities have changed and he's

805
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,680
no lo oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll confirm with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thisa but I</font>

806
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,410
don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> he still can engaged in</font>

807
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,109
the project so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> may need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a new</font>

808
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">editor we may need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some massive</font>

809
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:51,200
rework but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two I to work</font>

810
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:53,299
items ahead of us our first a very short

811
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,259
draft about how this yang model is used

812
00:46:53,300 --> 00:47:00,110
and then finish the yang model does

813
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody agree with that what does</font>

814
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,530
anybody disagree

815
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:17,500
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical man system so i would be so</font>

816
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:20,380
based on our discussion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on</font>

817
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,820
the mailing list we already got enough

818
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:28,050
comments and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> greg</font>

819
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:33,340
we would want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that model more</font>

820
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:36,100
more agnostic and dynamics used but

821
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:40,570
still use the technology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is welcome</font>

822
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:44,440
means but those are those can be suited

823
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:46,990
for IP so that what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing and</font>

824
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,600
we'll get it reviewed with regular on

825
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:54,459
for conclusion for that second thing is

826
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:58,089
second comment we got is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

827
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:00,730
model should be a superset of all the

828
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:04,600
IDF technology whereas the initial young

829
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:06,910
model is is not actually a superset of

830
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:10,480
our idea of technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font>

831
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,990
the second work we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do and</font>

832
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">I see lots of people running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

833
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,640
shattering the very broad question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

834
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,330
have we already have some yang models

835
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,190
for BHD and other volumes in IETF then

836
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:32,680
what happens to those we deprecate those

837
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:38,290
or this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace those noble double</font>

838
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:41,290
speaking of VFD chair so our the BTW has

839
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:43,210
design team to develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the airing the</font>

840
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,230
intention has always been if the line

841
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:49,210
produces a certain model to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used then</font>

842
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:57,460
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they work that the i-team does</font>

843
00:48:49,210 --> 00:49:00,490
will be more to comply with us so burn

844
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:03,180
wat class so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around that you</font>

845
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:06,220
can create you need an information

846
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,049
informational RFC and how to use this

847
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,390
young model becomes the deliverables the

848
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:13,270
Charter says applicability documents

849
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:19,450
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> does this secretary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I web each</font>

850
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:24,759
other great mercy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ericsson I just want</font>

851
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:28,330
to say I think that lime model would not

852
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,970
be super set in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Esther</font>

853
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:34,090
determine everything and everything has

854
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:36,879
to be congruent so their mind would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

855
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:40,360
some our<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology specific containers</font>

856
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,290
and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do is at least</font>

857
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:46,540
what I saw as a task one of the task in

858
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:49,750
front of the design team is defined the

859
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:52,630
common set of functionalities and see

860
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:56,820
whether this set is sufficient enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

861
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,820
have it expressed in common model

862
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,299
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments from Java first one is</font>

863
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:07,420
from Carlos<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignite arose as I agree with</font>

864
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:11,670
both of Ron's points and from Tom Taylor

865
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,670
I can help with a short draft for sure

866
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so let's see the design team i</font>

867
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,390
believe is complete now the two work

868
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:30,490
items we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have before us one is that</font>

869
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:33,850
applicability statement and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

870
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe we had a candidate for that the</font>

871
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:44,890
last time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we meet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that did we we did not</font>

872
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:47,710
so slight reorganization we lost well I

873
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:53,319
wonder how that came up oh that's in

874
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:54,760
your slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um we didn't have a</font>

875
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,370
candidate for that applicability

876
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:01,840
statement the conversation seemed to be

877
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:08,080
between Greg and Jeff and Jeff wisely

878
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:10,660
left the room Joe greg has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

879
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,930
sentenced to produce it would if we

880
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:22,319
sentenced you would you producer Jeff

881
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:31,960
left he<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew when to leave the room ok</font>

882
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:34,300
um next<font color="#E5E5E5"> um his is everyone happy with it</font>

883
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:37,180
was I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I need to hear a name</font>

884
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:40,150
three times before I remember it he left

885
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:43,330
the room to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fellow who offered to</font>

886
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">take up hisses work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Deepak oh he just</font>

887
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:50,170
moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok um would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you be willing to rev</font>

888
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,840
that draft taking the advice that you

889
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:54,730
heard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room today about what we</font>

890
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,600
will model what we won't model how we'll

891
00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:01,359
deal with extensibility for individual

892
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:10,089
away and mechanisms things like that

893
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:11,380
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on is we are based on</font>

894
00:52:10,089 --> 00:52:15,578
the comments of<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaking it</font>

895
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:17,349
performance-based are those common slide

896
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:21,549
that we saw common functions<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

897
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:26,950
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for comments to the model so</font>

898
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:28,720
if I i think i miss alexis has produced

899
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:31,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

900
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:35,288
comments 0 hour if there is something

901
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:39,069
that missing from those light you know

902
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:42,339
means it should be included that British

903
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:46,900
also would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful because we try</font>

904
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to generalize with them as basement you</font>

905
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:55,299
know means we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we very</font>

906
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:57,039
tightly scope the working group it has

907
00:52:55,299 --> 00:52:58,480
exactly two things to do the

908
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:03,299
applicability statement and the egg

909
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,299
model does anyone does everybody agree

910
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:15,900
does anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business our</font>

911
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:19,269
ad is coming to the microphone right

912
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Benoit speaking so you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

913
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:25,689
third deliverable in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter oh I</font>

914
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:27,578
guess I forgot the<font color="#CCCCCC"> target it's an</font>

915
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:34,239
architecture for OEM that can be used as

916
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:36,849
guidance for the other ITF working ah so

917
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,759
you know I understand the phase approach

918
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:41,410
right so if this has to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in later</font>

919
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:43,529
that's fine but let's not forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

920
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:47,950
yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't even thought about that</font>

921
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:50,259
dressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so share on the Rio Bravo</font>

922
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:52,569
one person I have how about the

923
00:53:50,259 --> 00:53:54,420
interaction between these OEM layers for

924
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:58,020
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> OEM in one layer</font>

925
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,720
wanna report to other layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a is rd</font>

926
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:04,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know we have message mapping and</font>

927
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:09,410
the heart disease we have hope you just

928
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:13,730
woke up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg yeah as as I mentioned the</font>

929
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:17,180
design team discussed it and it's a what

930
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:22,440
defect characterization in reporting so

931
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:27,779
yeah that is there is one of objectives

932
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:30,359
that will be looked at so even in

933
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:35,430
current young model we had tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie</font>

934
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:38,069
in different layers so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again as if</font>

935
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:40,399
it's a single layer means that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

936
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:42,960
a single layer but if there is a

937
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,349
possible tunnel is being formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

938
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,839
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an underlay and if you can make</font>

939
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's more of an in operational if those</font>

940
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:54,509
functions are available to operators you

941
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:57,118
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely go down to your client</font>

942
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:59,730
later go up to your server layer also so

943
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,410
that that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> our goal to make it</font>

944
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,410
you know usable in there

945
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:13,330
I think share on the very good how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

946
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:17,259
the protection switching all are we also

947
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:19,060
going to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that because the</font>

948
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:26,020
protection switching between layers they

949
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:28,420
also have to be coordinated protection

950
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:36,850
switching coordination is part of who I

951
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:38,620
am protection switching is not yeah when

952
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:42,549
we talk about on him it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

953
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:44,980
bigger traceroute it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance</font>

954
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:47,860
measurement fault management and fault

955
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,830
management includes a protection switch

956
00:55:47,860 --> 00:56:00,070
over and<font color="#CCCCCC"> armed suppression and</font>

957
00:55:50,830 --> 00:56:02,170
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with that said on</font>

958
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:06,820
what I'm hoping for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next meeting</font>

959
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">is first cut at the applicability</font>

960
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:14,080
statement an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you are an</font>

961
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:16,299
update on kisses document and if we

962
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,950
could if we could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

963
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,360
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF can it be great if we had</font>

964
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,149
some conversation on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list</font>

965
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">about both at least now i think the</font>

966
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,140
working group has a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus thank</font>

967
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,140
you very much to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> design team to</font>

968
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:31,920
everybody on it Jenn Gregg especially

969
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:35,710
Tom Taylor if you're listening out there

970
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:40,600
thank you all and I think it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

971
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:43,130
beer the drink not the protocol

972
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:58,930
yeah but it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of beer</font>
