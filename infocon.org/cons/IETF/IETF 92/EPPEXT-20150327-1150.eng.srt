00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,720
look I'll blame it on our ad that's not

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,869
really fair anyway we were actually i

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,109
was actually off just sinking and

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:28,480
coordinating with our any<font color="#E5E5E5"> d here as we</font>

00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:29,500
transition from<font color="#CCCCCC"> pete to very to make</font>

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,000
sure that we had everything under

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,800
control to be careful about which

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,870
meaning of sinking you're talking about

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:44,080
of course about sinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh guess just</font>

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:46,239
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is the meeting that</font>

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,540
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to hand out the blue</font>

00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,910
sheets um and Jabbar scribe and minutes

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:56,230
taker Alexander volunteered four minutes

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,360
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anyone who's willing to be a</font>

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,819
jabber scribe and I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,470
able to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here so because I'm</font>

okay let me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a breath here and</font>

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:37,560
now I'm sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down that's right it's</font>

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,130
Friday welcome certainly do appreciate

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,430
everyone you know sticking around long

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,429
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be here I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have a few</font>

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,350
key people who were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:55,490
stick around for the week and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish</font>

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:02:01,970
up here including my co-chair Antoine

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">asurane but he is here in spirit with us</font>

30
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,890
so EPP extensions this is the agenda

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,660
that I had proposed for here so our

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,410
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity of course is for</font>

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,630
agenda bashing anyone have any

34
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,350
suggestions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes to or comments</font>

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the agenda so we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a quick</font>

36
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,820
moment here and put the requisite note

37
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,739
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh up here which basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

38
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,290
means that you're here so the IETF owns

39
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,150
you if you have any questions are

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,880
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a few rfcs</font>

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,500
that you should check<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure that</font>

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're comfortable with all of that so</font>

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,430
well we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had one big success story</font>

44
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,290
here so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everyone and</font>

45
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,720
especially to Scott he's the author of

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,519
this document and certainly worked the

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,980
process and pressed us along to make

48
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,440
this happen so we have our registry

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,760
which exists and there's the pointer and

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,510
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just take a moment</font>

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,519
just to remind us about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of</font>

52
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">this registry a couple of key points</font>

53
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,400
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that it works we've</font>

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,549
settled on the idea that this is really

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">very open in broad registry the only</font>

56
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,450
requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that a specification</font>

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,100
exists and it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep in</font>

58
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind that that specification doesn't</font>

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,030
even have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exist within the IETF</font>

60
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,930
context so it certainly does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

61
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,060
be an internet draft or published as you

62
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,459
know an informational RFC that's not a

63
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,730
requirement here the actual

64
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,310
specification can

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:38,048
in any accessible publicly accessible

66
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:41,560
location and we do have a list of

67
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:44,290
technical experts led by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott</font>

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hollenbeck and Scott can correct me if I</font>

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,849
if I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this wrong or P prefer to say a</font>

70
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit differently but the important</font>

71
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:55,000
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind that the only role</font>

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,700
of these technical experts is just to

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,579
ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any specification that tries</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry is</font>

75
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,500
self-consistent you know that it makes

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,280
sense that there's no obvious glaring

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,180
concern with this document the important

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,099
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these experts</font>

79
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,560
are not in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> position to reject any</font>

80
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,978
registration in the registry I mean it

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be a significant concern</font>

82
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and an issue the technical experts will</font>

83
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,419
use the mailing list that we have the

84
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">EPP extensions mailing list will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font>

85
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,469
for all of its discussions and dialogue

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,550
so anything they're doing any comments

87
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they make will be you know</font>

88
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,090
transparent and open seen by everybody

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,090
the experts may interact with the

90
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,669
authors and you know try to to make

91
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,130
suggestions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the document</font>

92
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:51,250
or you know whatever basis that they

93
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,780
want to do but you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end in</font>

favor of publication unless there's some

97
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:06,010
very obvious and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> glaring reason</font>

98
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,479
to reject it and there'll be some

99
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:13,240
discussion on the list if that were ever

100
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:15,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i think the shoulder</font>

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,360
is to say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any questions or</font>

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,760
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like that is that we are</font>

currently looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 18 extension</font>

we've assigned to experts per document

110

so that everyone you know will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

reviewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> six documents the experts know</font>

of opportunity to share

114
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,050
that's before I Anna will start asking

<font color="#CCCCCC">questions and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the process</font>

116
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,860
we're going to follow the review

117
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,389
comments we post it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and once</font>

state what they are and then really

would like to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have any</font>

discussion from this group if there's

any more discussion to be had about

where to go the<font color="#CCCCCC"> epp the key relay</font>

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
document is the one which has been

132
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:34,599
getting the most discussion on the

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,060
mailing list especially recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

134
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,180
that the authors were asking for it to

135
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,349
be a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> trac document but there's</font>

136
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,129
a fair amount of discussion about

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:46,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether or not that document really is</font>

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:49,659
inappropriate forum for standards track

139
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:52,719
still some discussion going on about the

140
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,520
use of some of the burbs you know how it

141
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:57,580
integrates with EPP and whether it

142
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,310
aligns with what we understand you know

143
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,839
the EPP architectural model to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and I</font>

144
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that those all have to be resolved</font>

00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,159

00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're all depending on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

147
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,699
resolves there might be some changes

148
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to happen in the document so I</font>

149
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,529
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're ready to move that one</font>

150
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,300
along unless the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors want to instead</font>

151
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:18,879
switch to it being informational in

152
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,529
which case you know the document could

153
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,270
go as is because it represents what

154
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,839
they're actually doing and what they've

155
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,770
deployed and it certainly meets the

156
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:34,139
requirements for inclusion in the

157
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:34,139
registry the oh I'm sorry

158
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,979
you're right thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

159
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,690
Alexander I hadn't really i had not your

160
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,008
eye in terms of process and in terms of

161
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,870
formality it really should go for

162
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,280
working group last call just because

163
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,150
it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this working group under this</font>

164
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter and the way it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah the way</font>

165
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,169
this working group was was formed to

166
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,460
deal with these documents so if you

167
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,900
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> informational</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could go to</font>

168
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,460
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call for that and</font>

169
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:03,378
then move<font color="#CCCCCC"> along and scott</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is standing at</font>

170
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,049
the mic so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> scott hall and back again</font>

171
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:07,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">i just want to remind everyone that's</font>

172
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,169
the last note on the mailing list from

173
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,389
rick rivers one of the authors was that

174
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,948
they were they had decided the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors</font>

175
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,330
had decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to revise the approach</font>

176
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,550
that's currently in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

177
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,620
they were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to modify the approach</font>

178
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,909
to use one the gym<font color="#E5E5E5"> gould had suggested</font>

179
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,789
so i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've already made the</font>

180
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:24,199
decision that they're not interested in

181
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,259
publication as is as informational and

182
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,340
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in revising it for</font>

183
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:35,180
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good candidate for a</font>

184
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:37,968
standards track document so good thank

185
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">you for that um yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we see the</font>

186
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:44,990
new document will do another<font color="#E5E5E5"> review and</font>

187
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:47,149
we'll see where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay moving on to</font>

188
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,779
the launch bays document there was one

189
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:54,230
discussion about an errant comma points

190
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:56,600
point in the specification it's some

191
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,610
level it's a minor editorial thing oh

192
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,540
I'm sorry that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my I should get</font>

193
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of this then we won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

194
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,689
problem

195
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:13,400
okay which is sounds like an editorial

196
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,040
thing but it does change an

197
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,630
interpretation and maybe Jim do you want

198
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,939
to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say a word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about more</font>

199
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,439
about that yes I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

200
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,940
issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the comma i think</font>

201
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,070
it's a it's kind of an it feedback i

202
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,020
think i believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be getting more</font>

203
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,100
of those kinds of things as it goes

204
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:37,790
through the process so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

205
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,970
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that requires a new</font>

206
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,219
version of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and we have no</font>

207
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,830
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with publishing a new version</font>

208
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,350
with the comma in there but there's one

209
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">other item that was sent to me privately</font>

210
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,390
was to include one additional

211
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,640
implementation status for from one of

212
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:59,360
the other parties that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could include</font>

213
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,720
in there if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a need to republish</font>

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,400
for this but I've already requested for

215
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,150
working with glass call so the question

216
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:14,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is is is it ready post this or require</font>

217
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:17,620
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex my offer I believe so many</font>

218
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,300
version of this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in various</font>

219
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,850
names have been two names have been

220
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,079
around that we could we could probably

221
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,110
working couplet call it together with

222
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,360
dsm-v draft I think it's pretty stable

223
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:34,610
and there are implementations out there

224
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,560
so go and get it published right so

225
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,270
thank you for that I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do believe</font>

226
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,579
that this document is is ready for

227
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,670
working group last call<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I would</font>

228
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,920
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see would like to see the</font>

229
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,430
iteration see the revision and get an 05

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,160
with that comma in there I i don't i'm

231
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,300
neutral on the implementation issue and

232
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,260
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that should be in the</font>

233
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,670
document or not you know it wasn't put

234
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,350
to the list no one's had a chance to

235
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,540
comment on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if anyone</font>

236
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">else feel strongly about it I guess Jim</font>

237
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,280
gold that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an action item from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,620
last IETF was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> include the</font>

239
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,160
implementation status information to

240
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,160
help with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg review</font>

241
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,790
we've gotten i think it was about five

242
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,290
or six responses from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list for that</font>

243
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,420
that we've included in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest</font>

244
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of the draft so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

245
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,639
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's necessary to add yet</font>

246
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,529
another one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just want to open that</font>

247
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,610
up there's a possibility if we are going

248
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:39,879
to publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new man you have to I mean</font>

249
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this way if we might have enough as it</font>

250
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:47,470
is but I have no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with adding</font>

251
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:50,199
additional input so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess what I would</font>

252
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,819
suggest is as long as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

253
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,920
read the document any way to put the

254
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,449
comma in there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might as well add it</font>

255
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,910
and put it there it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a substantive</font>

256
00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:01,089
change so let's do that that information

257
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">would normally be included with the when</font>

258
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:05,379
the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd you know writes up</font>

259
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,120
the document and because they indicate

260
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,370
implementation status and they call that

261
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,569
out in that right up so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

262
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">well be complete we have the information</font>

263
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:17,529
i would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it so for this</font>

264
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,139
particular document I you know I mean

265
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,300
I'm prepared aight to simply do a

266
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,689
working group last call as soon as you

267
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,758
know version 5 appears and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

268
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:31,149
we can can make that a fairly speedy

269
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,439
working group last call will test this

270
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,639
out on the mailing list but I would

271
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:36,250
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a week would be enough</font>

272
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,730
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> just enough time get there working</font>

273
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,680
a document<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd some time to prepare</font>

274
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,110
what they have to do so that that's

275
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,620
ready to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it can go out the</font>

276
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,699
door and be done so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good</font>

277
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,439
no one objects will check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the</font>

278
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:55,180
mailing list but I'm not imagining will

279
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:59,949
have any objections next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the tmch</font>

280
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,569
SMD<font color="#CCCCCC"> time in hasn't been too much</font>

281
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:03,579
discussion here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is stable</font>

282
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,889
document I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

283
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,109
working group last call and unless

284
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:10,420
anyone wants to object I suggest that we

285
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,509
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> start that on this document that</font>

286
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,459
as soon as I can do that on the mailing

287
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,740
list I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the authors have</font>

288
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:19,119
asked for it but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

289
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,019
appropriate to declare that that's the

290
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,019
right thing to do at this point

291
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:30,439
yes this is Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> buldum he did ask for it</font>

292
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,620
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last message to list just take a</font>

293
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,930
look at it I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had grabbed</font>

294
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,600
it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that he had asked for</font>

295
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:45,859
working his last call on it but I

296
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:49,339
support it in any way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is francisco</font>

297
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,240
dias so chattering<font color="#CCCCCC"> gustavo yes he has</font>

298
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">requested this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be good for my son</font>

299
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that takes care of those</font>

300
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,570
documents and then the last one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

301
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,449
ID and map document this one has had the

302
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:09,290
least amount of discussion on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

303
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also struck by the fact that the</font>

304
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,420
document currently says that they're

305
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,190
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for experimental status that's</font>

306
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:22,430
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually says in the document</font>

307
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:24,380
itself so I mean even<font color="#E5E5E5"> as speaking is</font>

308
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,810
working group chair I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

309
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">precisely where to go with this document</font>

310
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,739
in part because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so little discussion</font>

311
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,479
I mean I can make some suggestions and I

312
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,640
have some comments from a process point

313
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,160
of view about it being<font color="#E5E5E5"> experimental or</font>

314
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,290
not but like to see if we can get any

315
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,120
discussion here about this document and

316
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,360
its status and what we should do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

317
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,940
I guess is Jim Gould based on my

318
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,400
discussions that I had with the authors

319
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,500
of this draft and there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

320
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,410
discussion earlier on specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

321
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,790
me around this one which led to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IV</font>

322
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,740
end table draft that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted but i</font>

323
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,000
believe and i'll let the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors speak</font>

324
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,620
to this though that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe their</font>

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,750
intent was for it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go standards track</font>

326
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,390
although it's i'm not sure why it would

327
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:13,940
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> experimental so that explain over</font>

328
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,770
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would suggestions that was so</font>

329
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,220
little discussion and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group is quite</font>

330
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">small that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about assigning like</font>

331
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,380
546 reviewers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that specifically review</font>

332
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,360
the document before we progress it

333
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,080
regarding experimental or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

334
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any opinion that</font>

335
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:38,630
okay so I heard two things one was Jim

336
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,490
suggesting that he thought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> author's</font>

337
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,990
really wanted standards track so maybe

338
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:46,640
this is just a an anomalous wrong

339
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">checkbox when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was submitted</font>

340
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,980
or something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's fine if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

341
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">look in the end the tools and the actual</font>

342
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,710
document that's what it says is its

343
00:15:53,510 --> 00:16:00,800
intended status that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was struck</font>

344
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,660
by that he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim cool again actually I</font>

345
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,670
think that this came up at the last I

346
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,230
ETF and we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

347
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,819
meeting minutes on that because i

348
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,160
believe is we were going up talking

349
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,840
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of these drafts each</font>

350
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">person was describing whether or not</font>

351
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,660
what the intent was I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had</font>

352
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:21,859
said that they wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand his track</font>

353
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,930
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just at the double jack and i</font>

354
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,480
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard alexander you were</font>

355
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,069
suggesting explicitly getting designated

356
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,980
people to review it so that we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

357
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,020
we have some actual documentation here

358
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

359
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,870
especially we are going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand to</font>

360
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">the track it is important to have some</font>

361
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of discussion on the list and at</font>

362
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,240
least some people to acknowledge that

363
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:45,140
they want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support the document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

364
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,880
move it forward you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and this is why</font>

365
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was just from a process point of view</font>

366
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,000
concerned his chair I just felt like

367
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this document hadn't really had enough</font>

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,300
discussion in that regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll have</font>

369
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,140
to look to the list and see if we can

370
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,599
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few volunteers to acknowledge</font>

371
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,720
their support for this this draft do we

372
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,599
know about implementation looking at gym

373
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,600
and he's shaking his head no but

374
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">geddes team gold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah I recommend</font>

375
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they add an implementation status</font>

376
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,080
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like we did with the other</font>

377
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:24,449
graphs we personally have not

378
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,300
implemented it we have our own custom

379
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,490
extension that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to migrate</font>

380
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:35,540
over to it once we can do the IDN table

381
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:45,060
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that we haven't</font>

382
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:46,350
implemented this either so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what</font>

383
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,300
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear as an action here is</font>

384
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,550
two things we should reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

385
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,590
authors to have them to indicate some

386
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,330
implementation status in the document so

387
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,159
that that's clear as we move the sink

388
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,449
forward and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get some</font>

389
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,250
volunteers on the mailing list to

390
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,860
indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> their support for this document</font>

391
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,720
moving on to the standards track and

392
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,389
we'll see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get I'm just going</font>

393
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pick a number in say 33 sound like a</font>

394
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,010
good number I'll ask for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the</font>

395
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,350
list 25<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexander saying five I know</font>

396
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,970
that's what dns op used to do used to

397
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,840
require five people to acknowledge a

398
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,640
draft before they move it forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

399
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,590
not opposed to that I mean we'll bring

400
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,480
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and press on that idea I</font>

401
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,090
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are certainly five</font>

402
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,620
people who we could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know who we</font>

403
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,709
should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to to read this</font>

404
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:36,330
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that that long a document um</font>

405
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:38,700
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that difficult Alexander</font>

406
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,530
Alexander um could we get volunteers

407
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,540
right now because I will typically

408
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,389
review it yeah and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the five</font>

409
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,670
names right now then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people</font>

410
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,560
have long flights back home and so like

411
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,120
that previews would come home on Monday

412
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,870
look for volunteers<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we have</font>

413
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,909
one with Alexander yes Jim gold I've

414
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,439
actually reviewed it and most of my

415
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,210
discussions were based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a review so i</font>

416
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,600
got i could volunteer since<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've already</font>

417

425
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,110
reviewing extensions you should not even

426
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,290
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be asked if you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

427
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:34,669
reviewing these documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those</font>

428
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,799
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on the standards track you'll</font>

429
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,600
not be asked by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna after the fact but</font>

430
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means the assumption is that you</font>

431
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,879
are reviewing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them before they get to I</font>

432
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Anna very good point thank you for that</font>

433
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:55,660
don't get to say no anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so those</font>

434
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,860
were the four documents about with which

435
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:04,160
this working group was charted with

436
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:05,959
originally and so I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is</font>

437
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:11,270
good where we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> track here to</font>

438
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:13,130
attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move these along and I think</font>

439
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that takes care of that will bring you</font>

440
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,710
no final decisions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list</font>

441
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,650
because we do have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of key</font>

442
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,270
people who aren't here but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

443
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:26,510
all in agreement about where to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

444
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:29,150
these things so okay other topics that I

445
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,620
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open the door for that would</font>

446
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,010
be relevant to this working group and

447
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,840
talking about would of course be too we

448
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,780
had a registrations operation workshop

449
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not certainly was not an ITF event</font>

450
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,299
per se but it is certainly relevant to

451
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,610
this group and I could say something

452
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:49,070
myself but I wondered Scott if you might

453
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,360
want to just give a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary for</font>

454
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,549
this group about that put you on the

455
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,580
spot I did not prepare you in advance

456
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,750
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is scott</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hollenbeck</font>

457
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,330
it's a topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know well I certainly</font>

458
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,100
don't mind talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I did post a</font>

459
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,199
summary of the workshop to the reg ops

460
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,000
mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if any of you are not</font>

461
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,540
on that list it's probably one worth

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,429
getting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's red jobs at NL net lab</font>

463
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,840
CML right yes and they use mailman so if

464
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:15,590
you just poke around a little bit it

465
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,439
shouldn't be too hard to find

466
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,149
subscription information the the first

467
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,900
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the workshop was explicitly</font>

468
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,350
focused on EPP extension activity

469
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,350
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did an introduction of the new</font>

470
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,610
registry the registration process you

471
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,719
know what the role of the designated

472
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:37,179
experts are and then Jim<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghoul</font>

473
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,800
registered the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 extensions</font>

474
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,110
you know to demonstrate that registering

475
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">an extension is as easy as filling out</font>

476
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,379
an email template and shooting it off to

477
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:52,090
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna excuse me so that part was really</font>

478
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:54,580
pretty easy we had a number of EPP

479
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:58,149
extension discussion topics which for

480
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,710
the most part we do we deferred you know

481
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots and lots of well what happens in</font>

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF types of discussion to today the</font>

484
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group it you know think of it as</font>

485
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,050
a group of interested people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

486
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,970
don't want you to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this work</font>

487
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and so I could plan that</font>

488
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,540
there should be some mix some more

489
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,120
discussion after maybe when I'm done

490
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,350
talking here the other thing though that

491
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is we also</font>

492
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,389
opened up the door to a couple of non

493
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,370
EPP topics because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more to</font>

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,040
registration operations than domain

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,379

latour from Sarah of all affairs from

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">CloudFlare you know Oliver has been</font>

498
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,890
banging the drum about the role of DNS

499
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,390
hosting providers in this ecosystem and

500
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,620
so we gave you know those two guys a

501
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,880
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

502
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,639
kinds of things that they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

503
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,150
and what a boil down to is that the

504
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,630
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can srs model is typically a</font>

505
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,850
registry to registrar relationship as a

506
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,230
hosting provider like Oliver has been

507
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,360
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work through a</font>

508
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,860
registrar to make changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to delegations</font>

509
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,389
and to deal with anything having to do

510
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,570
with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my customers and my</font>

511
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,860
services and so he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been you know</font>

512
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,629
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if there's interest in</font>

513
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,050
Dinah's hosting providers specifically

514
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,730
becoming a playing member of ecosystem

515
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,169
that would have direct access to the

516
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,830
registries to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they need to</font>

517
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,230
do so we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that for a little</font>

518
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,399
bit the other thing we talked about you

519
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,680
know richard barnes from mozilla

520
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,020
introduced the let's encrypt initiative

521
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,400
and the acne protocol and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might be</font>

522
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering well what does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have to do</font>

523
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,400
with domain names well it's about

524
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,570
publishing information in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS right</font>

525
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,190
let's encrypt they do believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

526
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a</font>

527
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,550
an opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a relationship to</font>

528
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:43,170
some work in gain gain is uses the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

529
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,250
to deliver its information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

530
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,980
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this might be something of</font>

531
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,120
interest to this community the other

532
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,650
thing we spent a little time talking

533
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,719
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well do we want to continue</font>

534
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,820
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what might we talk about next</font>

535
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,560
there was general agreement that we

536
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,110
wanted to do another<font color="#E5E5E5"> workshop in advance</font>

537
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,690
of the ITF meeting in Prague topics are

538
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,310
TBD well but it did seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that there</font>

539
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,000
were two that seemed kind of prominent

540
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:08,490
or possible one was our death the

541
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,810
registration data access protocol and if

542
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following the work of</font>

543
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,710
the weirds working group you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should even</font>

544
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">though actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been closed i'm</font>

545
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,460
sorry so now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go looking for</font>

546
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,990
the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did do but anyway</font>

547
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,500
weirds produced a protocol called are

548
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:25,260
down yet another candidate replacement

549
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,900
for who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one might actually</font>

550
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,020
have some traction in that the rirs in

551
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,120
particular are already running<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

552
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:36,480
there are this contractual language in

553
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,639
the contracts for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can licensed</font>

554
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,190
registries to implement it and run it

555
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,840
after certain conditions are met it's a

556
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,070
lot lighter weight<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot easier to</font>

557
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,199
implement than some of the other

558
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:49,320
candidates that were discussed and

559
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,810
proposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> over time so anyway this one I</font>

560
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,850
think's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some traction and I</font>

561
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,240
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have a</font>

562
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,199
workshop<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about what</font>

563
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,620
operations and operational parameters

564
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,540
look like before the policy people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

565
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,120
making decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how this should</font>

566
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:11,070
work in the absence of real operational

567
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:13,620
experience so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was one topic and the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no role of service providers in</font>

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the registration ecosystem was another</font>

570
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,280
continued discussion on the reg ops

571
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,230
mailing list so if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

572
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,580
following along and participating in

573
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,590
that please get on that list and please

574
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:32,159
join<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the discussion so thank you for</font>

575
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,720
that and and I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I do think</font>

576
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,190
this is an important workshop and it has

577
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned out it's turning out to be pretty</font>

578
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,390
successful we're really getting you know

579
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,370
the right people to come into this group

580
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and really talk about some of these</font>

581
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,419
technical issues and you know we'll be

582
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,890
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the extensions</font>

583
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,519
that will come through this group too so

584
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,739
it's a it's a good

585
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,659
I would encourage people to subscribe to

586
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:53,919
reg ops and make your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own decision about</font>

587
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,219
how involved you're going to be and

588
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,739
engage with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff and pay attention</font>

589
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:01,299
to the workshop what I meant here by

590
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:04,419
topics brought forward when I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

591
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:09,489
here is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there was a</font>

592
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:11,619
set of some EPP extensions that were

593
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:14,229
talked about very they do exist as

594
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:15,820
internet-drafts and so there's the

595
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:17,950
possibility that they might be

596
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:23,619
interesting documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

597
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:27,099
this group for a look at creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> itm</font>

598
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:29,918
standards so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that on the</font>

599
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:32,408
next slide I want to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think just use</font>

600
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,909
this as a mark point here and just say

601
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the point of view</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

602
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:40,389
this working group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our current</font>

603
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:41,799
charter you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our the set of</font>

604
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:43,299
topics that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked about and</font>

605
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,829
finished and having gotten to the end of

606
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,869
the slide in the registration workshop

607
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:50,049
you know that's been the work of this

608
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:55,439
working group I think our future here is

609
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:57,700
as in are under our current<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter is</font>

610
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,709
not especially long and fairly

611
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,450
short-lived and in fact I would not

612
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:05,529
expect for this group under its current

613
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,719
charter to meet in Prague ideally the

614
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:09,279
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have look like they're</font>

615
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:11,409
they're pretty well under control and

616
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,450
very close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> being ready a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

617
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:16,629
them actually are really are right on

618
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,639
track for working group last call with

619
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:21,218
you know measured in days here so we can

620
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:24,488
move them along so that's our current

621
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:27,959
expectation so that brings us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

622
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:30,849
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible topic of do we want two or</font>

623
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:33,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">more precisely is there a need for us to</font>

624
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach ardor and be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available to do</font>

625
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:39,809
future work and what that future work

626
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:39,809
might be so

627
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,129
going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry and its</font>

628
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:52,669
existence that's been published<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

629
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a singular purpose that</font>

630
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,140
this working group could serve or a

631
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,178
recharge diversions working group could

632
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,299
serve in terms of its relationship with

633
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:06,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension registry that's out there</font>

634
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:09,440
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for any extension that seeks</font>

635
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be an internet standard and be</font>

636
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,740
published as a proposed standard as

637
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,649
opposing as opposed to just being

638
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,289
documented this working group could

639
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:20,840
provide a home with participants that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

640
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:23,649
have for reviewing those documents and

641
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,149
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the technical depth of</font>

642
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:28,399
review that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> and would</font>

643
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:30,320
ordinarily be required and give us an

644
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,489
opportunity to examine implementation

645
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,860
experience and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too what</font>

646
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,890
I did here was go find a few of the

647
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,629
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been talked about I</font>

648
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:44,120
think I got everything here but there's

649
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,669
at least four I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're cursed me</font>

650
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,830
now that I might have missed<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but in</font>

651
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:53,299
any case we do have some candidates that

652
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:56,080
could easily be brought in here if these

653
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:58,580
authors are interested in doing that I

654
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,730
there has already been some discussion

655
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:05,600
on the mailing list about Gavin Brown

656
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,549
zpp fees document he had submitted it

657
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,689
just to the registry but there's been

658
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:10,520
some discussion on the mailing list

659
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,890
about making that standard track and

660
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,809
making it a standard and I see at least

661
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the mailing list some agreement</font>

662
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:21,139
among those participating there that

663
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,179
we'd like to see Gavin do that I have

664
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,950
not talked myself to Gavin about whether

665
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:28,100
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be willing to do that with his</font>

666
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:30,980
document he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not said anything on the</font>

667
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,299
mailing list in particular about that it

668
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,590
looks like Jim wants to come up and

669
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:39,710
speak to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that issue yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

670
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,059
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing is the fact that the</font>

671
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">extensions that are being registered</font>

672
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:46,668
into the registry I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

673
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,549
experts that are reviewing that will see

674
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:50,640
overlap and potential for coming up with

675
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:53,010
proposed

676
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,430
in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> to standardize some of</font>

677
00:29:53,010 --> 00:30:01,290
these but with these specific documents

00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:05,610
and Gavin in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he has switched</font>

679
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:08,159
it to the track<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat standards track in</font>

680
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last published version of the draft</font>

681
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe that isn't intense but it</font>

682
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,860
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font>

683
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:19,500
explicitly but I would support it to go

684
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,389
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be included in the insured working</font>

685
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,760
group and one of the grass that's

686
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,580
missing here is the IDM table graphics

687
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,900
that's right the IDN table am and as far

688
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,970
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drafts that I'm involved with</font>

689
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,300
including the<font color="#E5E5E5"> change pull allocation</font>

690
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:36,210
token and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IBM table I would like</font>

691
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:40,770
those included in a recharter another

692
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,940
working group the idea in just one

693
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,160
moment so the idea in table is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

694
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:51,600
document right I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the</font>

695
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:53,040
name up here yes it's a rule of Ibn i'm

696
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,790
not sure if there's a dash 290 in the

697
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">table but that's close enough and that's</font>

698
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,260
that was done with the co-authors of the

699
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,800
idea and math extension that's currently

700
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,800
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Charter</font>

701
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,970
go ahead just on leave usually well i'm

702
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,670
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering looks like we're kind of</font>

703
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,490
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of documents here for</font>

704
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,830
describing extensions some of them are

705
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,410
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended to be standard tracks</font>

706
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:25,260
because it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be probably implemented</font>

707
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,960
by multiple registries in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future so</font>

708
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,230
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of base blocks for the</font>

709
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,330
future while some others like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wilcox are</font>

710
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,070
basically just describing the state of

711
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world and my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding was that</font>

712
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,290
these would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> only used for as a</font>

713
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,460
baseline<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where the over lives are</font>

714
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:46,560
so would we make that second category

715
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,670
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> track actually doesn't seem to</font>

716
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,889
make sense to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be much better</font>

717
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:55,080
information all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me let</font>

718
00:31:52,890 --> 00:32:00,390
me focus this discussion in this way and

719
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:02,010
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> your question and the question I</font>

720
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:06,210
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put to the working group here</font>

721
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:08,400
today is whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we believe that</font>

722
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,550
we should recharter and that there will

723
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,800
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to do okay these were just</font>

724
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,879
examples of potential documents that we

725
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,710
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider pulling in and adopting</font>

726
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,440
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me take a moment to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

727
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:25,110
what I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect in the way this</font>

728
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,280
working group would work has compared to

729
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:33,689
how the registry works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just put</font>

730
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:37,020
this out there for discussion the goal

731
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:40,860
of the retarded working group would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

732
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,800
to only examine extensions that want to

733
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:45,419
be on the standards track but<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to</font>

734
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,639
one of the points that you just asked

735
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">about Jeb one of the other things that I</font>

736
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,510
would expect to happen is as this

737
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:58,620
registry becomes used and more and more

738
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:59,970
extensions get listed there I we expect

739
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,260
that there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some amount of</font>

740
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:07,590
overlap<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will appear and I would</font>

741
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,300
expect that individuals beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

742
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the technical experts who review these</font>

743
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:15,300
extensions would actually propose to the

744
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group that it might consider</font>

746
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,990
that it sees out there and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we</font>

747
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,460
would have to work with the authors of

748
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,230
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> documents to see if we could</font>

749
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,029
interest them into bringing it to the

750
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,830
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so it wouldn't be the</font>

reaching out to pull work items in but

753
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,460
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have to propose that and</font>

the domain name registration one by one

yes Jim gold with some of the extensions

778
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,089
that we just recently registered

779
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,440
although we didn't create them as

780
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,649
internet-drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think there will be</font>

781
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,379
some overlap with some of these other

782
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:54,270
drafts that may be discussed in this

783
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:56,699
group like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the bundle and we</font>

784
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,650
have a related domain extension that may

785
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,629
be of interest so the question is is

786
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,810
whether or not if some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

787
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:07,280
informational drafts and that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

788
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">is overlap and interest in working at a</font>

789
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,099
consolidated standard it might make

790
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:19,740
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to merge some of these</font>

791
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:21,690
together so again let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me try to be</font>

792
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:25,379
specific here about at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestion for how this process would</font>

794
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,390
work

795
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,460
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to prevent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know any</font>

797
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,680

798
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">in mind there will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be individuals who</font>

807
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,250
anyone would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a position to propose</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group that we should</font>

809
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,800
reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these authors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if we</font>

810
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,480
can't get those multiple authors and

811
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,960
their multiple documents to be willing

812
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come together to you know merge them</font>

813
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,180
and create a single documented standard

814
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,810
for doing that work I mean it's in all

815
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,490
of our best interests in to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

816
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:33,390
single way of doing things rather than

817
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:34,859
having multiple versions so and so

818
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">before I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked my question again Jim</font>

820
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:43,140
like i believe this follows up on that

821
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:45,839
discussion about the IBN EBP extension

822
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,609
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> here from Wilcox I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

823
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,780
the intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> was for that to be standards</font>

824
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,270
track of my guess was discussed

825
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,710
previously and if there is intention for

826
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,190
that to be brought up by the working

827
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:59,070
group I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have that</font>

828
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,140
merge in with like I said the extension

829
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,530
that we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have or others may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have on</font>

830
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so it might be that topic might be</font>

831
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,340
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group I just</font>

832
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,700
wouldn't support that draft as being the

833
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,700
basis

834
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:20,570
and Jeff just only um I do agree on for

835
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:24,560
those that will be stellar tracks but do

836
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">we again want to be a the recharter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

837
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,220
group to be a vehicle for RFC's

838
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,800
informational RFC that would just host

839
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,200
what has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the past whenever</font>

840
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever they might overlap or not it</font>

841
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,868
will matter it would just be snapshots

842
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,910
of what some registries have done the

843
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:46,010
past and it doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

844
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,680
standout track or not they're just there

845
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,450
as a snapshot of past implementation

846
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,919
basically do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that in every</font>

847
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,720
charter and I would say no again I want

848
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to carefully focus the purpose of this</font>

849
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,009
working group is only to discuss

850
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:04,400
extensions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are to go on to the</font>

851
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:08,119
standard track and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is barry i will</font>

852
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,990
add as ad that's what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> independence</font>

853
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:15,369
dream is for that's what the independent

854
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,368
stream is for

855
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:25,249
so the only question<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that I</font>

856
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,539
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask of this group and we'll</font>

857
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:28,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to take this to the list because</font>

858
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:31,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">again we do have a couple of key people</font>

859
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:33,619
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing but I think based on my</font>

860
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:35,419
private discussions with a variety of

861
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:37,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">people we have general agreement about</font>

862
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:40,189
this and I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the support</font>

863
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:42,039
of our ad as long as there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

864
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:45,890
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue this work</font>

865
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:49,009
that it would be it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

866
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,739
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recharter this group and give</font>

867
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:53,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">it the the singular purpose of reviewing</font>

868
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:59,419
extensions that are destined<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

869
00:38:53,659 --> 00:39:01,219
standards track we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't necessarily</font>

870
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:02,959
have to make a decision right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

871
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:06,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have to create the</font>

872
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:08,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">charter with documents in mind right I</font>

873
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:10,038
mean we don't they don't they don't have

874
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:11,808
to be listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Charter right away</font>

875
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:17,150
just have a defined scope for what we're

876
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:19,579
doing I say say again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry Alex Oh</font>

877
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:22,909
dad Barry said yes he agreed to me but

878
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:24,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah I said yes and Alexander said we</font>

879
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:26,839
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them in the milestones yeah</font>

880
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:28,549
that's absolutely correct we just the

881
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,578
Charter says what you're going to do in

882
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:32,929
general and the milestones say what

883
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:35,089
documents you're going to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

884
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:36,559
when when they're due so we can have

885
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:38,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">some discussion on the list about</font>

886
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,189
picking documents as part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

887
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:43,579
proposing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going</font>

888
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:45,288
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can do that now as a bit</font>

889
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:48,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a transition discussion one of the</font>

890
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:50,239
things which I did talk to our ad about

891
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:51,919
have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyone else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

892
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,439
working group about so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

893
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:59,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there now to see what folks</font>

894
00:39:54,439 --> 00:40:00,859
think but we do have the 1i there are we

895
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:03,140
have four documents in our working group

896
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,939
right now three<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which I think we're</font>

897
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:09,078
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move along pretty quickly right</font>

898
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:10,939
away it's not clear yet to me at least

899
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,909
as working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chair what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> status</font>

900
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:15,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">is of the key real a document maybe will</font>

901
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,799
fall into the fast-track category also

902
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:20,779
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> revision comes out and so that</font>

903
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:24,469
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things that</font>

904
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:27,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had proposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our ad is um would it</font>

905
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:29,539
be okay we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the recharter ring</font>

906
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,038
and we simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought that one document</font>

907
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,920
forward if it's not on the fast track

908
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,140
yet

909
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,780
we would bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it forward into this new</font>

910
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,040
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group with this new charter if</font>

911
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,070
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the standards</font>

912
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,900
track that just provides a<font color="#CCCCCC"> demark point</font>

913
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:47,130
in the life of this working group versus

914
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,680
the new one and Alexander Alex under my

915
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,120
effort um first<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight I don't</font>

916
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,640
understand what the fast track would be

917
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,859
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made up that term what I meant</font>

918
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,299
was just that we're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to closure</font>

919
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,220
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish them before we</font>

920
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:04,440
actually ran an interesting new document

921
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:07,049
Drake yeah yeah anyway i see sorry for

922
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,240
the confusion if we if we consider a

923
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:12,720
charter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says that the working group</font>

924
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,359
will well pre-release<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work on</font>

925
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,750
documents of the specifying EPP

926
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,460
extensions that are in standard strike

927
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,700
then that would actually include the

928
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">relay document as according to Jim in</font>

929
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,299
the new revision radio to say no we are

930
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,129
not going for informational so we're

931
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,360
going to realize it so essentially i

932
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,030
think that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter could simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

933
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,120
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a charter to</font>

934
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,470
work on EPP extensions that have the

935
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,750
goal of being in standard strike

936
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,930
document and yes about it it could be a

937
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,670
two-line charter yes I put everything

938
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">else into the milestones and we can</font>

939
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:50,330
adapt<font color="#E5E5E5"> a milestones on every meeting</font>

940
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,230
that's the intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I let's make a goal of</font>

941
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:56,180
setting a record for the shortest

942
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,180
charter the fewest words in each other

943
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other critical thing to talk</font>

944
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,700
about with any working group is what its

945
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:08,070
lifetime is likely to be and so this

946
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,200
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a topic which Barry and I had</font>

947
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,230
had talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about he had had pressed me</font>

948
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,240
on this question and I will now exposed

949
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:19,200
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group the response that i</font>

950
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,810
gave him in this category to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extent</font>

951
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,120
that the registry of extensions really

952
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:27,360
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live forever you know what</font>

953
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,190
one could it always has the concern that

954
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,730
this working group could be very

955
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-lived and live forever too but of</font>

956
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,110
course we really don't want to do that

957
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,118
and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response that I given to bury</font>

958
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,920
and

959
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,359
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked a little bit about this</font>

960
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,009
issue with a few other people but not

961
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,589
the issue of a lifetime of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

962
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:49,999
group there's a certain expectation that

963
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:52,308
there'll be a number of extensions that

964
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:54,558
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear over the next year</font>

965
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:56,930
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next couple of years so we're</font>

966
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:00,319
expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fair amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

967
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:02,990
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the near term</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

968
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,660
suggested was I think that they'll come

969
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,339
a time when that pipeline you know kind

970
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">of ends when suddenly nothing new is</font>

971
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:11,509
going to appear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be finishing</font>

972
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,160
up what we're doing or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe they'll</font>

973
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">just be one item left in the pipeline or</font>

974
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,529
something there'll be a I suggested that

975
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,890
there would be a fairly obvious time

976
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:24,079
when clearly our workload is shrinking

977
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,098
and and it's you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

978
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't look like there's anything</font>

979
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:29,240
significant coming and it seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

980
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:31,939
that that would be a good time and we'll

981
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ourselves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

982
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,289
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad is going to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it with us and</font>

983
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,450
we could just subjectively decide that

984
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:40,849
you know now is a good time let's end

985
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:44,058
this working group and then what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF</font>

986
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:46,339
we do going forward is when somebody

987
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants a new extension</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

988
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:51,230
standards track they'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do quick</font>

989
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,509
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one off working groups to deal</font>

990
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,950
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one extension as they happen</font>

00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:56,680
or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you get a package of them</font>

992
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">together we could do them together and</font>

993
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,489
Barry please and I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't</font>

994
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:04,579
tend to reuse this working groups

995
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:07,700
mailing list for it so it's basically we

996
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:09,769
are reconstituting this working this

997
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group the only reason I want to</font>

998
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:14,450
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way rather the other option</font>

999
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,549
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the working group in a</font>

1000
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,649
sleeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> state until the documents come</font>

1001
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:21,019
and then wake it up and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1002
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,089
it becomes hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work to wake working</font>

1003
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:25,160
groups up without going through a

1004
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:27,880
chartering process to remind<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

1005
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,879
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay attention</font>

1006
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:36,869
Jeff Jeff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's an objective</font>

1007
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:43,500
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluate if we reach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that point</font>

1008
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:45,210
where we should close down<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Barry</font>

1009
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">just said he doesn't need it doesn't</font>

1010
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:50,280
need to be objective<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but personally</font>

1011
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:53,368
I've seen this several work groups in

1012
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,770
the past going zombie<font color="#CCCCCC"> samee alive for</font>

1013
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:57,329
some time because some people in the

1014
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,890
group actually thought that it was

1015
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:00,780
finished some others thought that they

1016
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,029
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get one or two document more</font>

1017
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,000
out of the door personally I'd be in

1018
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:08,970
favor of putting a deadline say two

1019
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,339
years and say if we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my tree</font>

1020
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,230
charter about that after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'll close</font>

1021
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,119
it it's dangerous sometimes to put a

1022
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:18,839
deadline but I think two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1023
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,089
resuming its that order zombie

1024
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:25,470
possibility and maybe that possibility

1025
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:27,630
is real I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Barry would you</font>

1026
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,790
object to having that not be in the

1027
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,829
Charter but rather be a milestone that

1028
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,630
we put in afterwards which we could then

1029
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:42,410
change without getting the whole iesg

1030
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:44,940
involved if we wanted to good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1031
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,799
so let's include that in the minutes

1032
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,690
that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular point and we'll make</font>

1033
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,859
sure that that gets entered on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1034
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:53,010
mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if there's any</font>

1035
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:55,049
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion about it but that seems</font>

1036
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,790
reasonable to me too unless anyone wants

1037
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,790
to object to suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> something different</font>

1038
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

1039
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:08,920
any other discussion about reach our

1040
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,770
Turing so the actions that I would

1041
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,980
propose from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on this</font>

1042
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:18,300
particular topic hope I'll pause Wes

1043
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:21,160
wants to channel somebody from Ming Kong

00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,010
row meeting you suggested that this

00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,560
extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be a standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trac</font>

1049
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,270
working group so I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I read a</font>

draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this topic later the EPP xed</font>

1051
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:39,970
working group is if it is retarted me

1052
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:42,550
adopted a note yes it would be a

1053
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:45,490
candidate for adoption name so yes thank

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the door I mean basically</font>

1056
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,750
open the door and anybody who has a

1057
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,970
documented extension you're welcome to

1058
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,290
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the group and you know the</font>

1059
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:59,620
group will then have a discussion about

1060
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,480
the standards track you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity</font>

1061
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,609
for the document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1062
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,100
get agreement will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking I mean all</font>

1063
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,810
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal IETF you know requirements</font>

1064
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,810
and process would come to bear on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font>

1065
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,460
that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I mean you get broad</font>

1066
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,020
technical review with a large part of

1067
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,120
the community be looking for

1068
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,220
implementations that kind of thing

1069
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,200
interoperability I mean all the usual

1070
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:23,200
kinds of things one would expect would

1071
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,180
have to get handled and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1072
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,549
should probably emphasize that a little

1073
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:33,310
bit because one of the things we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1074
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:34,630
be careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> of is that we really do want</font>

1075
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure that we focus only on</font>

1076
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,020
standards track documents that's the

1077
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,509
goal of this working group because we

1078
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,400
don't the goal of this proposed new

1079
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,900
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group we don't want to conflict</font>

1080
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,240
with this registry that's out there

1081
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,890
we've already agreed that the registry

1082
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,140
is there for people to document whatever

1083
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:54,520
they're doing and you know there's

1084
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:57,730
that's that's a fine way to proceed so

1085
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,770
if there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always true that somebody</font>

1086
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,000
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to really want it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the</font>

1087
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,310
standards track to bring it to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">working group we don't want to find</font>

1089
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:07,480
ourselves in a place where people are

1090
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,770
just trying to toss it into the working

1091
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,350

1092
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,850
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it be bounced out</font>

1093

1095
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,610
to want to standardize it because we'll

1096
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,500
all commit resources to it and we want

1097
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,630
to be fair about that too and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1098
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people understand that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,050
it to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group just to get</font>

documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and free review go ahead</font>

1102
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:35,620
Alexander Alex my offer as the former

1103
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here with a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

1104
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,609
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group looking in the room I'm a</font>

1105
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,650
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit concerned about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume on</font>

1106
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:46,090
the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the room because</font>

1107
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:48,220
I mean we have like 20 people know about

1108
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,470
10 of them are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading email so</font>

1109
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,089
it boils down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially a couple of</font>

1110
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,339
individuals we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the work</font>

1111
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,930
so it would be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1112
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,720
interesting things would be to keep the

1113
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:00,609
traction in that working group over the

1114
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,680
next two years if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to continue</font>

1115
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I see a major point would be to</font>

1116
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,730
actually get people from the richest

1117
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:11,890
reciting multi idea for which is hard

1118
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:15,250
yeah because they usually not go to ikea

1119
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:17,470
meetings but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1120
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,060
probably down to like 10 people in a

1121
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:22,779
year from<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1122
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:24,640
problem i mean i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1123
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,230
of those subjective criteria that we

1124
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,490
will keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes time to</font>

1125
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,380
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether to continue the</font>

1126
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,419
working group or not and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1127
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,450
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spin it down and deal with</font>

1128
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,430
documents on an individual basis this

1129
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular issue I mean EPP in</font>

1130
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,029
general and all things EPP related I

1131
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,540
mean fundamentally there are at least

1132
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:44,680
two you know industry partners if you

1133
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,720
will that have to be part of this

1134
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:49,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">process registries and registrar's I</font>

1135
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,319
mean we do have a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of significant</font>

1136
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:55,330
registries here today we have and there

1137
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,160
are others on the mailing list so I

1138
00:49:55,330 --> 00:50:00,450
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually fortunate and that</font>

1139
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,430
we seem to have the registry community

1140
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:05,350
reasonably engaged depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

1141
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,490
want to judge numbers I mean you know

1142
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that we have happened deficit</font>

1143
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:12,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">novice around is not much of a</font>

1144
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,630
comparison when you look at the number

1145
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,660
of service providers that are out there

1146
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">now but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of registrar's that's</font>

1147
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,600
always been problematic and we know that

1148
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:24,379
I think the workshop that that actually

1149
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,910
you know verisign had

1150
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,099
you know pushed on this first time

1151
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,649
around it's really going to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1152
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,869
more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> community thing we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got go</font>

1153
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,150
daddy in particular you know probably

1154
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:37,460
the most significant registrar engaged

1155
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:40,549
and they're actively involved and I know

1156
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:42,500
that Roger<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carney</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was here earlier when</font>

1157
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:43,549
the meeting started he waved to me from

1158
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,890
the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room as he was leaving</font>

1159
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:48,319
he had an early flight out so he could

1160
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:52,160
stay till the end but he is engaged he

1161
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,650
and actively so and I know that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1162
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,750
us there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us registries who</font>

1163
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,950
are going to do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here going</font>

1164
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,900
forward to try and bring more

1165
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:02,149
registrar's in and we would obviously

1166
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,650
encourage more people to do that we're

1167
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:06,079
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as we start to show some</font>

1168
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:09,170
successes will actually start to see

1169
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,980
more people interested too so you know

1170
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:16,730
and it's hard to say but that's an

1171
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:18,380
important evaluation criteria for for

1172
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,390
all of our documents I think as we go

1173
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,759
standards track as a working group we

1174
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:26,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to manage that to make sure that we</font>

1175
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:29,230
have evaluation by a few key people and

1176
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:31,339
Federico wants to come to the mic I

1177
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:36,890
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a comment regarding</font>

1178
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:40,038
the new document the prevail document

1179
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:41,900
it's basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sellers document I</font>

1180
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:45,019
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really important</font>

1181
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,849
document because I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1182
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:51,669
comment here regarding the Brazilian

1183
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:51,670
market because of the policy

1184
00:51:51,759 --> 00:52:00,250
developments inside of icon there is a

1185
00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:00,250
lot of registrar these days that are

1186
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:08,920
starting to withdraw phone from

1187
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:08,919
agreements with Vikon and become

1188
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:16,640
resellers especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our in our</font>

1189
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:18,170
market so this this is definitely very

1190
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:24,058
important work that we should

1191
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:25,529
standardized so thank you for that ed

1192
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,539
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make a comment on priority</font>

1193
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:29,069
gret making you talking what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were</font>

1194
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:31,140
talking about not not names convoy what

00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:32,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">I meant for who is engaged in this and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">he PP EXT meeting and I haven't read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1198
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:39,049
lolly<font color="#E5E5E5"> history but I've no general idea</font>

1199
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:41,519
was down the group but there's

1200
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:44,160
possibility that this might begin to

1201
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,488
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to D s hosting providers to submit</font>

1202
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,479
des records I'm saying possible as I

1203
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:50,369
understand what the protocol is all

1204
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:52,828
about but it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

1205
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a span admission for the</font>

1206
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:57,029
protocol if we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the management</font>

1207
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,589
of the DNS beyond the registry register

1208
00:52:57,029 --> 00:53:01,079
a model that we were so used to thinking

1209
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:02,459
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I would think about it although</font>

1210
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,890
I may regret<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sciences maybe is a bad</font>

1211
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:08,189
idea but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do see possible scope</font>

1212
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:12,390
creep for the protocol might come into

1213
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:15,288
play so the only comment I'll make about

1214
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:18,058
that is and I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're aware of</font>

1215
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:20,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oliver's some is generally the one who's</font>

1216
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:23,569
been vandalizing this bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1217
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:28,109
operators as more of an integral<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

1218
00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:30,199
this registration process certainly that

1219
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:33,420
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the potential solutions is</font>

1220
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:35,069
getting them engaged using EPP as a

1221
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,769
protocol as part of the process but

1222
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:39,808
there are other ways of doing things and

1223
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:41,218
that's an open question in the previous

1224
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:43,769
slide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had here where I talked</font>

1225
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:45,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">about future topics you know the</font>

1226
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:47,968
workshops are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

1227
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:49,469
with this issue in the large and at the

1228
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:51,150
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that they're coming close</font>

1229
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:54,299
to a solution then I would expect that

1230
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:56,279
solution to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> home in the IETF in</font>

1231
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:58,049
an appropriate way whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1232
00:53:56,279 --> 00:54:02,789
group or some other group that remains

1233
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:04,829
to be seen and Francisco please this is

francisco diaz<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> francisco</font>

1235
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:11,309
respond so he's saying the intention

1236
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:13,529
with the idea map trapeze to make its

1237
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:17,489
under he<font color="#E5E5E5"> says that his intention is to</font>

1238
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:20,249
update it and submit a search and he's

1239
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:23,489
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss potential merging with</font>

1240

other drops like Jim's<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop if that</font>

1241
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:29,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">makes sense okay so thank you for that</font>

1242
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay not seeing anyone else at the line</font>

1243
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,660
and wes is not looking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he wants</font>

1244
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,480
to channel anybody from the jabber room

1245
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:41,430
so let me try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and restate again we try</font>

1246
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">and just summarize and capture again</font>

1247
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,180
what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the actions from this</font>

1248
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular step and and the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1249
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:53,069
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work going forward I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

1251
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,190
during would be a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't</font>

1252
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">see anyone objecting at the moment so</font>

1253
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:01,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll take that as a positive hum and we</font>

1254
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,819
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring that question to the mailing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">list just to confirm that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1258
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,010
go forward we should have some

00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:12,210
discussion on the mailing list about

1260
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:16,260
what that charter is going to look like

1261
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:18,240
and the chairs will take as an action to

1262
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,460
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a first proposal on what that would</font>

1263
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,279
be get some discussion on the list and

1264
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,230
we'll work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ad to move that</font>

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,480
forward and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll pause here now while</font>

00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,380

supposed to be real late or not then

1269
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,420
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zhu said that the purveyor or</font>

1270
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,760
reseller information is important to

1271
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,290
both registrar's and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users so</font>

1272
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,740
there's a big requirement for them to do

1273
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:45,390
this extension yes and thank you for

1274
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:49,589
that that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a draft that was</font>

1275
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:51,480
discussed at the workshop just purely my

1276
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,920
interpretation that I didn't sense out

1277
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,360
of the workshop that that was an

1278
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,850
immediate candidate for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

1279
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,790
group but that in no way is intended to

1280
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:02,009
reflect that it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be brought to</font>

1281
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,520
the new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so i apologize if</font>

1282
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:08,550
there was any implication there and

1283
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">francisco yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> francisco wrists and in</font>

1284
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,050
the case of the if by the seller you

1285
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,600
mean the having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to provide</font>

1286
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:18,090
the reseller a solid point to the race<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

1287
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,250
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meant yes yeah and</font>

1288
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:23,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not yet yeah that's certainly a</font>

1289
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:25,800
topic of interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

1290
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,300
case of gTLDs the reason coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> polish</font>

1291
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation that will require all day</font>

1292
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Italy is to provide this information to</font>

1293
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this information so they would have</font>

1294
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:36,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to request this from registers so there</font>

1295
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,990
is an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having a standard</font>

1296
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,959
extension to do this right

1297
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:45,209
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to this nice short list</font>

1298
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,309
of five possible I think we've gotten

1299
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">another four or five already has</font>

1300
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:51,480
possible candidates for documents to

1301
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,980
move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think our assessment</font>

1302
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,480
earlier that there would suddenly be a

1303
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,910
great deal of activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the short</font>

1304
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">term to move some stuff along is pretty</font>

1305
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:02,759
true and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll be good okay so quickly</font>

1306
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,319
a quick recap<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list and</font>

1307
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,180
confirm there's no objections to reach

1308
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,950
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turing and we will start a</font>

1309
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:11,220
discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list I'll make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1310
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:14,308
proposal with Antoine for the new

1311
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,509
charter and we'll have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

1312
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:17,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the list to move</font>

1313
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that along and then as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as that's</font>

1314
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:24,538
complete and we submitted to our ad and

1315
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:26,220
it goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg process I would</font>

1316
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:30,420
expect after that event<font color="#E5E5E5"> has occurred</font>

1317
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:32,189
then we come back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we I mean maybe</font>

1318
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:36,089
our ad will let us overlap this a little

1319
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:37,799
bit but then we get to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1320
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:40,109
documents and decide which ones we're

1321
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:41,819
going to take in or look for authors to

1322
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:44,880
submit documents for standards of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i</font>

1323
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:47,099
should say we certainly have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree to</font>

1324
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,520
review anything that anybody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1325
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,599
submit as a as a standards track we may

1326
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,880
have to have some discussion about

1327
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,289
priorities here because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1328
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,250
have a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of documents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1329
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:58,349
think we're going to be doing them all

1330
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:01,799
in parallel but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess we'll sort that</font>

1331
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:03,779
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing list too and our 80s</font>

1332
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:06,390
at the mic please absolutely overlap

1333
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:09,210
this stuff once you once you and I agree

1334
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a charter just assume it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1335
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:18,750
get done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start the work and</font>

1336
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,430
we'll check the boxes appropriately so

1337
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,160
in parallel over the next month i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

1338
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:26,368
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know wrap up the documents</font>

1339
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,078
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have before and also be talking</font>

1340
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">about our new charter and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that done</font>

1341
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,210
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can then immediately</font>

1342
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:36,390
transition in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> May June</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time praying</font>

1343
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:41,640
to working on these new documents and

1344
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:43,319
moving them along<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1345
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the assessment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore that I</font>

1346
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,579
would expect as long as we've got a

1347
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:52,140
series of documents to to work with then

1348
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:54,570
that will plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet in in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague</font>

1349
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,250
I mean I'm assuming they'll probably be

1350
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:58,560
a set of documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have some</font>

1351
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:04,680
reason to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting in some future</font>

1352
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:06,450
discussion so okay and this actually is

1353
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,549
my last slide just a replay of the

1354
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">agenda so we covered everything on the</font>

1355
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:16,620
agenda and the last item down there is

1356
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:17,880
any other business so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is</font>

1357
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,410
comfortable this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just any other</font>

1358
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,120
business question any comments about

1359
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,730
anything and then we've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or</font>

1360
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,250
anything new we should talk about this

1361
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jim gold one suggestion is to if you're</font>

1362
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:30,840
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting in progress make</font>

1363
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:34,470
it earlier potentially have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know</font>

1364
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:36,330
closer to win be the row meeting maybe

1365
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:39,149
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore we can get more people to</font>

1366
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:42,270
be here in person that's a good

1367
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:43,500
suggestion I mean I know that the ITF is

1368
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:45,410
good about that they don't they don't

1369
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:50,400
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't draw the short straw</font>

1370
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:52,170
all the time they try but I know Barry

1371
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,960
that the registration workshop is not

1372
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:57,960
really an ietf event but no will try as

1373
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:02,430
I remember you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday in in</font>

1374
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Honolulu as well weren't you related</font>

1375
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:08,370
late in the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime maybe it</font>

1376
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:12,000
wasn't pride yeah oh well maybe it was

1377
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:14,069
before I didn't meet in Honolulu I

1378
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,360
thought we'd I actually don't room i'm

1379
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:17,340
pretty sure i haven't we did meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

1380
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:20,640
little but I'm get<font color="#E5E5E5"> way rotting over to</font>

1381
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:23,670
your meeting yeah but in any case just

1382
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,319
put in in the freeform text but early in

1383
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:28,500
the week preferable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make sure</font>

1384
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that happens right so since I guess</font>

1385
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,260
that workshop will probably happen on

1386
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,140
the weekend if we could get a monday or

1387
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,420
tuesday that would be great and Wes

1388
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,370
there's two plus ones in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java room</font>

1389
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,500
for earlier time slot please yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

1390
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,029
everybody likes early times I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1391
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,240
actually actually knowing in advance

1392
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:48,900
even if it's lady in the week like today

1393
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:51,720
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not bad to have the the role in</font>

1394
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,910
this afternoon or maybe tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not</font>

1395
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,950
in the middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the week that that</font>

1396
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:58,620
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad for people that only will</font>

1397
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">be following this working group and the</font>

1398
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">rolla meeting and that's a good point</font>

1399
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,069
too I mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> row has to have its</font>

1400
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:07,950
own discussion about what

1401
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:09,930
he wants to have its meeting I mean yeah

1402
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it were to to want to try</font>

1403
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,990
and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the week and on</font>

1404
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:15,440
Saturday that might be interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1405
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:18,560
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead time does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that need</font>

1406
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:22,110
because we we don't get the agenda out

1407
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:24,930
too early so yeah if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to</font>

1408
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:26,790
coordinate unless one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings is</font>

1409
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:28,799
set fairly early it's harder to

1410
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:30,450
coordinate that I think role was pretty

1411
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,000
good this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time around to know pretty</font>

1412
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,740
early on when it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be so I</font>

1413
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,080
would suspect that it'll probably do the

1414
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,759
same thing the next time around also so

1415
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,620
you'll know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make your request</font>

1416
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,560
you know when that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1417
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:49,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">right just make the request here</font>

1418
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">appropriately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weekend so we'll do</font>

1419
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,950
our part to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that work I know</font>

1420
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:56,190
Scott that you're not actually driving

1421
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:58,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the next time around but maybe</font>

1422
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:00,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all just work together to get the</font>

1423
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,609
scheduling a little better organized

1424
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:03,870
yeah sure Scott<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hollenbeck here just the</font>

1425
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,610
one little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of feedback I'd like to</font>

1426
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,560
share is I did an awful lot of polling

1427
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:10,410
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance of this particular</font>

1428
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,990
workshop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consensus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font>

1429
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:14,160
actually said they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend was</font>

1430
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they'd rather do it earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1431
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,359
week then later I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> after a long</font>

1432
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:25,560
week of fun here everyone's looking to

1433
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:28,080
go home yeah so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> frederico is going</font>

1434
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:31,470
to come to the mic here I Scott's

1435
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:33,960
completely right but but I met my the

1436
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:35,819
reasoning of my committees for us to

1437
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:39,390
bring more veggies for us or people that

1438
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:42,120
would not stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF week but</font>

1439
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:46,319
would stay for the first day or the last

1440
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:48,930
one so would even could use the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF</font>

1441
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:53,100
they pass or something for for this

1442
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:57,509
meeting so I mean just to be fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1443
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:59,700
process here if you will you know we

1444
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:01,980
have a desire to want to have our

1445
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting as close to the registration</font>

1446
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,060
workshop as possible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have to</font>

1447
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:08,910
recognize that the registration workshop

1448
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:11,850
is not an ietf event and so you know

1449
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,490
Barry is agreeing to be kind to us as

1450
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:17,460
far as that scheduling is concerned but

1451
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:18,720
ITF scheduling is IETF scheduling we can

1452
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,180
only ask and hope

1453
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,759
the best so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1454
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:27,660
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets stated pretty clearly here so</font>

1455
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:30,119
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have unintended expectations</font>

1456
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:32,549
and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> took prove that I'm not</font>

1457
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,349
entirely insane I just looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1458
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:37,349
proceedings from Honolulu and there are

1459
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:41,520
minutes blue sheets<font color="#CCCCCC"> and audio recording</font>

1460
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:44,369
and so on for this so i presume we did

1461
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,859
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need in Honolulu I was pretty</font>

1462
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:48,599
sure we did but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just can't picture</font>

1463
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:53,310
that meeting as uniquely as any other

01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:02,819
business from anyone anything in the
