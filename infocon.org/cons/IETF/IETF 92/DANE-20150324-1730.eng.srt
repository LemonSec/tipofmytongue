71
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:24,219
implement Dane for IRC and we are

72
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,349
missing something to indicate that the

73
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,060
IRC server needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support TLS so I</font>

74
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,890
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give the assurance that my super</font>

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,200
dusty lesson that I could can't find

76
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,200
anything in Dane that allows me to

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">signal this so I guess there should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

78
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,979
draft or something or this or I'm too

79
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:43,810
stupid to find it an easy way for the

80
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">appeared the draft process would be for</font>

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,010
you to write a<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft about this I'm not</font>

82
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,800
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in this just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

83
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:56,620
problem find a volunteer yeah

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,199
we'll have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Western about it I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

85
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,270
some kind of ID I'm Paul office I I

86
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,169
think you can just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TLS a record on</font>

87
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:08,169
what it's a underscore 66 67 dot tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> dog</font>

88
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:13,628
here are you see server name and you

89
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:16,270
would do the right thing yeah so let go

90
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,889
yeah right its text so yeah this isn't

91
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,750
really a bender bashing match but what

92
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,800
to do that really quickly and the is the

93
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,900
author of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstract which is</font>

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,460
somewhere in the state of this stuff it

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,530
specifically has recommended that each

96
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,878
new protocol should write a new draft

97
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:36,628
and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say much other</font>

98

than great 68 67<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok great ok the chairs</font>

99
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:42,370

soon as this openpgp working for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Islam</font>

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">is over so that would be happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

106
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:02,909
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two documents that we would</font>

107

like to just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of soon next slide</font>

108
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:11,380
or milestones well we are falling behind

109
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:15,099
schedule as you can see the yellow is

110
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:19,210
what we what I'm proposing will be the

111
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:21,130
new milestones for these and there are a

112
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,779
few milestones where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

113
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,029
documents right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to</font>

114
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,919
start to either see some documents or

115
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:35,289
indication of people writing documents

116
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:38,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a relatively near future so are you</font>

117
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:41,919

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,080
said before I guess you forgot there

120
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,690
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a document for Dana and ipsec</font>

121
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,580
and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on implementing an</font>

122
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,529
implementing something but we figured

123
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,240
it's too soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write at the doctor yet</font>

124
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,590
so there are still some issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

125
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,300
pretty quarter document they want to

126
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about before we submit a draft but</font>

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,770
like consider a minus one perhaps

128
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:07,240
submitted timeline roughly will this be

129
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,990
done before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we close all the working</font>

for a second day and we have we have

139
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,979
code and we're fully funded so you know

140
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,229
I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to sort deferred to the</font>

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,570
and obviously this is an experiment so

147
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,570
you know there will be some demo effect

148
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:25,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and while this is happening we've</font>

149
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,320
just realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we forgot the obvious</font>

150
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,229
thing of who is going to take minutes

151
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,539
and who is going to scribe we've got

152
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:36,080
over carried away would be within the

153
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,559
echo thing and so yep new sheets are

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,620
circulating whoever has the blue sheets

155
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:50,239
they should come back this way Paul<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

156
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:57,080
who will be meeting minutes meeting

157

161
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,470

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:27,290
thank you excellent so seeing as you

163
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:31,279
have started scribing does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean</font>

164
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:34,189
you're willing to carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> inscribing who</font>

165

what me yes oh I was looking for the

166

172
00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:00,410
meat echo stuff but if they said they're

187
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,450
white box so I'm that's not gonna work

190
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,959
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much and so there's so so this can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

191
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,300
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick I got 10 minutes lot</font>

192
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,860
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot to say so we've been</font>

193
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,050
playing around with the the SYM thing

194
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,340
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the discussion started how to</font>

195
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,380
implement it how to give it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

196
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">people how to use it and in doing the</font>

197
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,830
implementation and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some</font>

198
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,599
really early pilots with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds</font>

199
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,690
something interesting uh interesting

200
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,160
avenues to take mostly there are things

201
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list and the</font>

202
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,699
the text we suggested everything we have

203
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,969
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ate our dog fit a little bit</font>

204
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,970
and let's see so one of the things that

205
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,590
came up was we we talked about the

206
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,360
underscore anchor underscore sign we

207
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,620
found that that was very easy to sort of

208
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the support come up at the end</font>

209
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,890
when we talk about labels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font>

210
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,689
but doing discovery for different types

211
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,040
of keys in different ways is a lot

212
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than getting a big lump all at</font>

213
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,920
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> and separate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount so we really</font>

214
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the suggestion that came up a while</font>

215
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,689
ago and implemented it we also there was

216
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,060
also discussion of adding a field called

217
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the axis field and I think probably in</font>

218
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,910
the next presentation you'll hear a

219
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,080
little bit about why that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

220
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,240
was a good idea in other places as well

221
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,800
but certainly when doing work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

222
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,130
one week<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it was really really useful</font>

223
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey we found um you discovered</font>

224
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,640
something you learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> something from DNS</font>

225
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,380
but really you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go somewhere else</font>

226
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,569
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get it from an ldap</font>

227
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">forest or something like that an ad for</font>

228
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,040
us or no infrastructure and so having a

229
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">uri we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of bored the access build</font>

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,520
and said having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a uri there can be</font>

231
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,530
really useful especially if the dane

232
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,340
record gives you crypto so that only

233
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,410
other into that you

234
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,890
riu can then secure that transaction

235
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,780
with what you learned earlier and so we

236
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,460
we actually released an open source

237
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,720
library to do day<font color="#E5E5E5"> in s fine with all</font>

238
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,960
these features<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called lip smaug</font>

239
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,390
it's up on github now we also we also

240
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,480
released a Thunderbird<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin which we</font>

241
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,040
very shamelessly board from enigma which

242
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,960
I think we've mentioned we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

243
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the last time the working group</font>

244
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,280
met and you know we're really interested

245
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,950
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> people downloading it using it the</font>

246
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,930
there's a serve a walkthrough on how

247
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,640
you'd install it it has a generator so

248
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,439
that you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a cert and it'll</font>

249
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,360
generate the SYM a records and so you

250
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,860
can copy and paste them into a zone it

251
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,440
even has a helpful script if you want to

252
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">generate your own s/mime certs and</font>

253
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,800
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure exactly how to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font>

254
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,069
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation</font>

255
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,719
is simple but complete enough to do so

256
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,270
wow that came out really well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well</font>

257
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,980
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more screenshots that you</font>

258
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,840
know what don't take my word for it be

259
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool if you um if you felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

260
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,550
downloading and trying it um we also

261
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,189
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting work that I guess</font>

262
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,770
Glenn will run through in a minute but

263
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,530
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be around all week and if</font>

264
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,819
you're interested in doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this please</font>

265
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,410
download it or seek us out<font color="#E5E5E5"> or both and</font>

266
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,940
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool i'd</font>

267
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,980
love to demo it for you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now i can</font>

268
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,830
send email security<font color="#CCCCCC"> crit sign everything</font>

269
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:55,250
all by learning keys from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> s1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

270
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:57,410
God food delicious so the whatever you

271
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned we want everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

272
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,020
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> the creamy goodness you can</font>

273
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,120
move so we have this is it's a white

274
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,520
listed service that we put outfits free

275
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,100
give folks away<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of experiment</font>

276
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,040
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gang records</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you there right</font>

277
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,960
now there's a proof of concept for an S

278
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,189
wine type and an experimental type to

279
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,380
support some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff we're</font>

280
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:22,670
doing but the idea was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give folks way</font>

281
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,650
to create a delegation so that they

282
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,750
could host some of these more bizarre

283
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:31,939
records off on a name server that behave

284
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,710
itself ostensibly and we also ran into

285
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,080
dealing with some of the authorizations

286
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,840
for changes to zones it creates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

287
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of a problem you're talking about</font>

288
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,880
folks personal crypto material key

289
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,829
material for a user within a zone does

290
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,840
you really want the zone administrator

291
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,130
changing the keys that you're using for

292
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,710
signing the pic to your email for

293
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,230
example so we tried some different

294
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,030
approaches to that and if you if you

295
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,160
want to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with this send a</font>

296
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,959
note to me or<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and we can get your</font>

297
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">net block white listed on the service so</font>

298
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,950
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go around it and</font>

299
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,470
that's that's it for this piece I think

300
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the something on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one the</font>

301
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,590
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought my next in queue yeah</font>

302
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:21,560
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> go already hug before the baby hi</font>

303
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:30,500
people great and you had five mix so

304
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:36,680
that's good we can go a bit over<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font>

305
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:40,190
like I can bear to go right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font>

306
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,469
uh this next one I recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

307
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,120
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing list</font>

308
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,740
highlighted that there's a bit of a

309
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,870
mismatch between what we're doing here

310
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,180
payment associations and the way the

311
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,980
group is chartered and I think that's

312
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,160
worth talking about but what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

313
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,690
highlight is there are some changes

314
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,510
happening in the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been part</font>

315
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:02,470
of conversations in the w3c the web

316
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,240
payments group in the credentials group

317
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,860
and in the wrestling with some of the

318
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,950
problems and problems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think dane</font>

319
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,440
really is an excellent tool for solving

320
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,540
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not email so when you look at</font>

321
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have for this</font>

322
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,520
working group this clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little</font>

323
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,709
bit outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that scope having said</font>

324
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,860
that I think it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring some good</font>

325
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,370
conversation for us so what we did is we

326
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,860
created a new record type that tries to

327
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,570
resolve this and we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some code behind</font>

328
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,720
it we worked with some folks at armory

329
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,390
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody hears use Bitcoin those</font>

330
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,510
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a really nice secure wallet</font>

331
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:44,000
for handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin they implemented</font>

332
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,990
some code in their wallet to actually do

333
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,200
the Dame look up BSA an email address it

334
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,790
could render a Bitcoin address so if I

335
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,310
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to be able to pay me</font>

336
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,290
coin I can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them my email address</font>

337
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can ultimately get me the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

338
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:03,140
without me giving them a 34 character

339
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,119
address or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan Reiner it's really</font>

340
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,000
interesting work to blow this out into a

341
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,359
far more complex mechanism it seems like

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,800
cryptocurrencies go that way but but to

343
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,679
really do some interesting things with

344
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,899
multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> cig and other signing and and</font>

345
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,320
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the stuff up in their tree</font>

346
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:25,520
on a non main trunk branch of the armory

347
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,500
wallet but the question this begs is

348
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,560
obviously doesn't really fit with the

349
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,960
Charter but<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do it seems</font>

350
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,260
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's more stuff coming</font>

351
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,880
that Dane is really a nice solution

352
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,010
coupled with being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sack you end up</font>

353
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,320
with this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat chain of trust it</font>

354
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,680
can deliver all kinds of of reliable

355
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,260
information of folks where do we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

356
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,320
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas so so if payment Association</font>

357
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,200
doesn't belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the question is then</font>

358
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,100
where would it belong or does this group

359
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,540
recharter to take on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

360
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">association you know as you see more</font>

361
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,899
folks bringing it do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

362
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,590
encourage innovation encourage folks to

363
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:09,680
find other good uses for Damon<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS sakky</font>

364
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:14,919
so so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to leave that as a no</font>

365
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:18,610
question hopefully talk about comments

366
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,610
from anybody in the audience

367
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:06,590
and something i should also mention if

368
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,289
people do think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be working on</font>

369
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,149
this it would help<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they you know</font>

370
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,769
review current documents and help us

371
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,360
move other documents forward so that

372
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:16,129
there's time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> space for this and</font>

373
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously we need to check with our ad</font>

374
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:21,590
on you know if it is charter if we can

375
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,869
be traffic ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

376
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,970
encourage discussion on this document on

377
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:27,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list for now and we will</font>

378
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,840
take up the question of adopting it

379
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,330
after we have had some more feedback and

380
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,129
thank you for bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I see no</font>

381
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:39,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we can't take this on unless</font>

382
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:42,019
we find a better home<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks okay okay</font>

383
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and while we're waiting for that to be</font>

384
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">figured out um could I get a hum on if</font>

385
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,879
people are interested in this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

386
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,440
think it's useful if you think it's

387
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,820
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be two hands one if you think</font>

388
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,379
that this is interesting and useful and

389
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,899
the second will be if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think this is</font>

390
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:57,799
not interesting in useful so if you

391
00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:02,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is interesting and useful</font>

392
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:06,970
come now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is not</font>

393
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:10,100
interesting and in no way useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> um now</font>

394
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,809
great then for the scribe or a minute

395
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,610
person there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of humming for</font>

396
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:17,600
this is interesting pretty much nothing

397
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:21,428
for not so darn way to intrude oh yeah I

398
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,428
guess can we get yeah person to person

399
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:35,200
in theory the audio is supposed to now

400
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:40,180
appear out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speakers behind us is</font>

401
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,970
the theory whoever that is might want to

402
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:50,080
also start typing it into the Java room

403
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:52,270
in case Oh what he what a victor typed

404
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,919
into the jabber room a bit ago was there

405
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,840
is there enough energy in the group to

406
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,370
review the new work I've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble</font>

407
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,179
getting feedback on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were on</font>

408
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Charter mm-hmm so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the if you</font>

409
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,940
think this is entering in useful you

410
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,860
have we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to get through some of our</font>

411
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,560
existing work hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a bit of</font>

412
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,149
an incentive<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to do that um if</font>

413
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,700
we do actually have enough energy to

414
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:19,540
actually get anywhere with us I don't

415
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:26,560
know was that Victor who was first in

416
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:33,850
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let's try the next one hi it's</font>

417
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:36,610
Dan York do you guys hear me<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

418
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,740
Victor's now behind me in the queue I'm

419
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,840
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna say this was like I thought</font>

420
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example of the kind of</font>

421
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,850
new things<font color="#CCCCCC"> were were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh Dana's enabling</font>

422
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,889
and so I was delighted to see this

423
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,899
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here and I hope that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

424
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,190
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to make this work as we</font>

425
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,190
move through some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> documents</font>

426
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,810
so nothing substantive other and say I

427
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,280
will go and review the document I'd

428
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:01,419
encourage others to I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you brought</font>

429
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:05,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">it here and my audios blasting in the</font>

430
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">room I'm told creepy having done</font>

431
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,390
speaking from all right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I have</font>

432
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,310
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get myself out of the</font>

433
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,900
queue so I can't walk away from the mic

434
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:22,179
so somebody has to take it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> me or</font>

435
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,950
something so feedback from me echo

436
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,740
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no clue from a remote user about</font>

437
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to stop themselves from being in the</font>

438
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:36,690
mic line whoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're gonna give</font>

439
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,690
Victor another world

440
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,090
nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately we don't take it</font>

441
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,620
picked audio from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor so I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

442
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor has typed into the jabber room</font>

443
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:58,429
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

444
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:04,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now for the fun part of the</font>

445
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:07,580
discussions as you know we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

446
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:10,610
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last call on openpgp key and</font>

447
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,020
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going along very smoothly and</font>

448
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,090
everybody looked like they were very

449
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy about it and then people started</font>

450
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,560
asking questions and we threw out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

451
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:25,520
dragged up a few ghosts from the past so

452
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are now in a process where we are not</font>

453
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,910
the expert any more on the topic that

454
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:35,720
has been raised so we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer</font>

455
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:38,600
Pete Resnick as a guide or a pope on

456
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,930
this issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how to work out</font>

457
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mapping between various ways of</font>

00:23:41,930 --> 00:24:01,190
spelling and email address yes orbit

459
00:23:51,100 --> 00:24:06,439
fine you figure it out yes no I'm trying

460
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:09,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a long time I'm very cheery with</font>

461
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,160
one day mobile hours and 10 minutes left

462
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,220
that counting or anything um so the

463
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,550
problem presented as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand it i</font>

464
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,170
did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little reading up on this is we</font>

465
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,540
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand</font>

466
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,790
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the address somehow into the dns</font>

467
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the problem with the left hand side</font>

468
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,110
of the address is it is case sensitive

469
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,440
the other problem with the left hand

470
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:35,149
side of the address is it can be one of

471
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">these funky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eai things but i don't think</font>

472
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've even gotten there yet we have good</font>

473
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,710
love that um thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> three that's a little</font>

474
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,440
funky about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

475
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:48,560
dress is that it's documented as 64

476
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,060
characters and labels can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be 63 I'm</font>

477
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,730
not convinced that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a real problem</font>

478
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:57,860
yet but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll maybe get back to that</font>

479
00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:00,559
so the I'm sorry you it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

480
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,559
well no no I I mean if we wanted to do

481
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,770
it directly as opposed to tensions it

482
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,780
the case sensitivity problem is a

483
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,270
problem whether it's directly or hashes

484
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,760
because if it gets cached<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are going</font>

485
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to end up with things in someone's hatch</font>

486
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that someone's going to compare case</font>

487
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,299
sensitively and not know to do something

488
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">more interesting case intensity and not</font>

489
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,340
know what to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

490
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,780
interesting with um I i I'm not even

491
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,189
sure where to start the discussion

492
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:34,340
precisely there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as I understand it</font>

493
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:38,480
a couple of suggestions for ways to go

494
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,299
about doing this um and I think we

495
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">should just do a little queuing here and</font>

496
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:46,299
have a chat about some of the ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

497
00:25:44,120 --> 00:26:55,820
some of you in the room have ideas John

498
00:25:46,299 --> 00:26:59,000
Paul I there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are plenty of people what</font>

499
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,460
you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that your proposal</font>

500
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to just use whatever case whatever</font>

501
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,390
version of the left hand side you have

502
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:46,800
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't work oh well</font>

503
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:52,380
o people in the remote can't hear you

504
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:55,020
can you try to make in front so to

505
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,570
summarize<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am proposing that the</font>

506
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,360
documents say this hasn't been solved by

507
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the applications area in two decades or</font>

508
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,580
more and we should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be yes it is well</font>

509
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,320
no it doesn't need to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

510
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially that we are not the ones to</font>

511
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,980
to start now here's a question than

512
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,260
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jon and I had dinner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last night</font>

513
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,470
he asked has any other application

514
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,110
that's not ldap had this issue for and

515
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,450
if so can we follow along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> John</font>

516
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I drew a blank but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else</font>

517
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,710
who isn't saying we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ldap</font>

518
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,230
directory then you know if we're the

519
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:34,890
first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font>

520
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:38,640
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the answers yet John Levine</font>

521
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:41,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">I i put my foot in this fairly severely</font>

522
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if we we look back through</font>

523
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,800
the book if we look back through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

524
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:49,830
the various male RFC's and stuff we've

525
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,960
tried really hard to avoid putting any

526
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,760
semantics at all on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local park you</font>

527
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,590
know and we can we've tried really and

528
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,940
although we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that pretty much</font>

529
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,959
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world doesn't have to</font>

530
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,240
ask a case holding the Speck explicitly

531
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,520
doesn't say does it doesn't allow you to

532
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,080
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we also know that in the</font>

533
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,280
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the AI nobody knows what case</font>

534
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,320
holding needs and you know it's it no

535
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,780
it's known to be insoluble you know well

536
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,300
we're so I entirely agree with Paul that

537
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,370
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of writing down</font>

538
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,980
with a bits do you can say

539
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:28,020
you know take take take take the address

540
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,970
it as you know as given and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

541
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,230
and encode it you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if anything</font>

542
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">else happens you lose my concern is that</font>

543
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:41,010
this sets a dreadful precedent because

544
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:43,440
reality is that people will guess you

545
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,809
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that either we should</font>

546
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,360
solve this problem or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can you</font>

547
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:51,030
describe what you mean by guess in this

548
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,740
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is if we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

549
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,370
down the hashing route I'm gonna do a

550
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,140
hash I'm gonna go look that up and it's

551
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,270
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna succeed or fail right now</font>

552
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,550
how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guests now happen what what</font>

553
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,490
happens now you try other cases so if

554
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,590
you had something that was Pete Pete

555
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Resnick with capital P and capital R now</font>

556
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,459
you try it with all lowercase and if

557
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that doesn't work maybe you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try it with</font>

558
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,210
a capital P but not again and so on yeah

559
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,520
or you stick where you stick a dot

560
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,970
between Pete Pete and raised it<font color="#CCCCCC"> beyond I</font>

561
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,440
mean the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

562
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,870
lots of heuristics that will work a lot

563
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,610
of the time you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

564
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,500
like it's pretty common to have stuff

565
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,510
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> good names with dots between them</font>

566
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,610
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty common to have have the</font>

567
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,590
first word the first unity the first

568
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,550
letter of each word to be capitalizing

569
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:40,770
but this but the spec doesn't say that

570
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and particularly when you</font>

571
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:46,980
have mail systems lash-up the ldap<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

572
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,170
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't my understanding it's fairly</font>

573
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,350
it's fairly common that it's like you

574
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,450
have one user john smith you know and

575
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:57,928
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking all that for j smith and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

576
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:00,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you know and then then tomorrow his</font>

577
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:03,150
boss whose name is John Smith gets an

578
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:06,600
address and now Jason is ambiguous so

579
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:09,929
ldap will say sorry try again so you

580
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,990
know this is it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad problem and</font>

581
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:14,820
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I and I would be really</font>

582
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,150
uncomfortable even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though technically</font>

583
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,059
Paul suggestion would work it's that

584
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:23,070
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty much for</font>

585
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,379
telling people to use heuristics that I

586
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,090
don't think you want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so then</font>

587
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,130
it sounds to me like you're saying do

588
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,169
what Paul said and put a lot of really

589
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:34,179
really scary language in there that says

590
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,509
it would be nasty to guess actually

591
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:38,799
if it were up to me I would say you know

592
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:40,720
maybe hashing isn't the right way to do

593
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,158
it maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put maybe instead we</font>

594
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,070
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> use like an app to record or</font>

595
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,539
something that points to an HTTP yeah at

596
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,789
the points you know that points to some

597
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:50,230
sort of server secured through name they

598
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:51,519
can actually interpret that they can

599
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually interpret the local park the</font>

600
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">way ml so ever would the only thing that</font>

601
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,039
can interpret it is an SMTP server

602
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:04,119
because RFC 5321 says to do otherwise

603
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:05,980
would violate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we could wiggle</font>

604
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:08,320
it to the point that we could we could

605
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:12,070
we could say that we have some other

606
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,649
server that is not that is supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

607
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:21,158
do the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mail server does</font>

608
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:22,449
yeah next Keith Moore I am somewhat an

609
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,590
agreement that perhaps this working

610
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,259
group is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right place to sort</font>

611
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,139
this out I'm also in agreement with John

612
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:31,029
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I what I was concluding</font>

613
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:33,729
right as he was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that DNS</font>

614
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:36,100
trying to map this into dns and get this

615
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,200
in a single look up via just<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns isn't</font>

616
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,719
going to work you really do have to go

617
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,460
to some other Oracle because because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

618
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,899
the quirks of the DNS protocol and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

619
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,480
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quirks of email</font>

620
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:48,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses you can't use DNS as case</font>

621
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,529
folding that's not sufficient you can't

622
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,960
use hashing that's not sufficient so

623
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:55,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the right thing to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is use DNS</font>

624
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,100
to find an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle that you can use to</font>

625
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:59,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">look this up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you present that</font>

626
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,408
Oracle exactly what you present an SMTP

627
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,869
ver SI 2 and that Oracle has to give you

628
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:08,590
the so if you present<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to failure</font>

629
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:10,570
cases one was um using<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is case</font>

630
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,600
holding that would get you false

631
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,090
positives using hashing will get you

632
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,549
false negatives yes there are separate

633
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,990
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I was make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

634
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:21,580
didn't you didn't can't those were the

635
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,899
same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started my first thought</font>

636
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,129
in my head was well you could do both

637
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,719
you could try one if that doesn't work

638
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">try the other and I'm actually convinced</font>

639
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,369
as too<font color="#E5E5E5"> many gaps that that you that you</font>

640
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,899
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is too messy so I really think you</font>

641
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:33,639
basically have to go to some third or I

642
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:34,779
think someone that was shaking his head

643
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,309
so I might find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reason that that</font>

644
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work but in that case I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

645
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:39,700
we're completely hosed and so you what

646
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,070
you want before you go down is what you

647
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,980
want is the Oracle to return some

648
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,658
canonical form that you then look up or

649
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,830
do you want the oh no I don't know why

650
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,630
all the Oracles that give you

651
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">ki I think the Oracle would give me the</font>

652
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,010
key i don't know why i<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce expert</font>

653
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,890
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're gonna drain</font>

654
00:33:54,010 --> 00:34:01,390
the remote q Oh who's up remotely please

655
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:03,940
go it's always Victor<font color="#CCCCCC"> a victor if you</font>

656
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:07,539
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak that's fine if not someone can</font>

657
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:14,520
jabber scribe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> victor cannot someone</font>

658
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:16,570
wanna it as Stevens got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy now so</font>

659
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,629
Victor make types of the new he does

660
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:23,950
I'll go but he said most areas has

661
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:25,598
worked fine for me and he also said or

662
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:29,138
is it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what jelly is his work</font>

663
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,690
for him muslimah the comment from<font color="#CCCCCC"> victor</font>

664
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,710
is how often do people enter email us is

665
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:38,409
given noble in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reply or use</font>

666
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:42,369
address book and those who have a very

667
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:45,070
high success rate of<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it very</font>

668
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:46,570
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably overestimates</font>

669
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,609
because it very much depends on what's

670
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,589
generating the thing that you're

671
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,469
replying to there have been plenty of

672
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:55,810
systems historically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that generate funky</font>

673
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:58,209
left-hand sides when they are

674
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,259
automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> generated that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

675
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:03,040
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what you would type</font>

676
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,680
normally and most of those are occurring

677
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,339
on systems that are case-insensitive

678
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,080
anyway so I you're probably going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

679
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,630
up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same place of getting false</font>

680
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,970
negatives it's not entirely clear to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

681
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,800
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that false negatives are big</font>

682
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,500
giant problem but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's a nun</font>

683
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,070
deployables so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I know for a</font>

684
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,710
fact that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people who use gmail</font>

685
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:29,500
use upper case for their names and put

686
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,390
dots in in arbitrary places neither<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

687
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,310
which gmail cares about and they have

688
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:37,359
probably stored the name all<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowercase</font>

689
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so the lookup won't work and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

690
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:48,069
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another remote who's next in</font>

691
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:51,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">line on the remote it's a queue jumping</font>

692
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:54,130
mechanism so yes go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead go right Ryan</font>

693
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:55,920
so I think the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a very high</font>

694
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,310
level to summarize it is it's a

695
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,110
discovery versus publication

696
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,970
differentiation and I

697
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,040
the discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> really needs to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

698
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,169
the application it could be through a

699
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,950
mechanism which happens to be published

700
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:13,830
in DNS but not deign as long as there's

701
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">some way to do a lookup to canonicalize</font>

702
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:19,710
I mean there are certainly things that

703
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:21,630
could be done in DNS to assist such as

704
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:25,220
encoding<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known rules from</font>

705
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known servers but beyond that I</font>

706
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:31,049
think it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to sit on the</font>

707
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,290
application side as opposed to on the

where the Oracle is applied first

710
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:45,960
somehow and then Dane is used yes so I

711
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,180
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got up to say very similar</font>

searching in the DNS I don't understand

721
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,450
why it would be something that we would

722
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,859
bury in a infrastructure service for

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,120

739
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,740
microsoft there is some experience of

740
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:14,460
building identity systems based on image

741
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:17,549
and one of the classic

742
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:23,910
problem is that an email is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

743
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">term identifier like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a when john leaves</font>

746
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,089
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i look at that the property</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

747
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:39,210
there I look at the failure mode of this

748
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:40,799
the failure mode is that you you it's

749
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:43,109
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the false positive is the failure</font>

750
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,270
mode when the false negative is too bad

751
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:47,609
but you try again you get it the false

752
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:50,820
positive is Vida failure mode right and

753
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:53,910
and that that is a huge force positive

754
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:58,320
and that's to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a mechanism to say hey</font>

755
00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:00,000
how do we deal with that yes but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

756
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,089
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's specific to this</font>

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,520
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side issue let's</font>

758
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:11,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">say a different issue i think it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

759
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean on otherwise I mean hashing with</font>

760
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:17,640
launching I have large enough hash that

761
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:21,119
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low probability of</font>

762
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:24,210
getting a false positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

763
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,460
good enough but so is there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> false</font>

764
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive problem that is not um</font>

765
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:35,070
something that is a false positive now

766
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:37,800
independently in the email system that's

767
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:39,900
the hash collision if you have a hash

768
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,570
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I right hash collision right so</font>

769
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's hash collision is the potential</font>

00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:48,450
false positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there another one day</font>

771
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:50,280
and no i don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you jump if you</font>

772
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,589
have another one please no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font>

773
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,330
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cuz even even the me</font>

774
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:56,910
stating the dogs or the things like that

775
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:59,430
I mean all of those heuristics are very

776
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:01,799
unlikely to generate right a false

777
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,540
positive because since people do that

778
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,400
all the time I mean that means that

779
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,550
there would be a mess at the recipient

780
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,990
so does anybody think we want to worry

781
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:21,119
about hash collisions here good thank

782
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:25,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right answer yeah Chris</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Newman I also do not want local part</font>

784
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,260

group

786
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,770
god I feel very strongly that there is

787
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,540
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and only one protocol where local</font>

788
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:40,650
part resolution should happen in that is

789
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:43,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">smtp and i am i think it may very well</font>

790
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:47,820
be not just for this application but for

791
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:50,790
other applications uh important to solve

792
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,970
the local part lookup problem and to do

793
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:56,490
it soon so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would be supportive of</font>

794
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,740
activity to do it but the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

795
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,959
to be go through it look it up through

796
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,600
sm VPN feels very strongly about you

797
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,490
would have a new smtp verb or something

798
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,319
like that yeah well we could you know a

799
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:15,830
modification of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> burfi command</font>

800
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:19,470
basically but with more feature so so

801
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:22,650
I'm probably a little confused how this

802
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,399
would work so like my mua would go off

803
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:28,290
and go and talk to some smtp server

804
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,420
where I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i oh and</font>

805
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,009
say please expand this and then it would

806
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,720
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and then it would fix that in</font>

807
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,760
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I typed and that it would send it</font>

808
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,299
to the smtp server that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually</font>

809
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">using for my mail check I would need my</font>

810
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,490
mea would need to connect to put 25 or

811
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,040
whatever on someone else's mail server

812
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,120
and say please convert this for me yeah

813
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,420
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work as a</font>

814
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,089
downpour 25<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

815
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:58,230
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be worked out yes</font>

816
00:41:54,090 --> 00:42:00,510
somewhere else yes but the the the key

817
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:03,000
thing is the local part resolution

818
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,570
problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more hot as much harder to</font>

819
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,320
solve than you think for example mailing

820
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:12,960
lists most mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list software does</font>

821
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,330
its resolution in flat files there's no

822
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,370
directory look up so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

823
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:20,299
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the MTA you can't resolve</font>

824
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,799
those local parts that's just an example

825
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,520
you can create lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lists of things</font>

826
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,830
like this so the MTA has this knowledge

827
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,990
nothing else does there's no director

828
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,480
you can look up there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no other place</font>

829
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,939
you can look this data not to

830
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-circuit a lovely conversation but</font>

stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> here Chris</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I if you do have</font>

833
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:51,959
to do the Oracle in bit um is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there now</font>

834
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:55,660
any use in putting this stuff in Dane

835
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,950
how is Dane<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's some heads</font>

836
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,230
going yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there might still be</font>

837
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,089
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let the line continue on I'm</font>

838
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:03,340
actually I had a clarifying question

839
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,430
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be done in</font>

840
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:10,869
the smtp give me the HP done n smtp or

841
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:13,240
by the smtp server by the smtp server<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

842
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:15,550
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the understood that sure</font>

843
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,180
sorry yeah sorry thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for the</font>

844
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:20,410
clarification and there's rowboat folk a

845
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:28,690
remote person in the queue<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see me I guess again oh very</font>

850
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:45,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">good no writing it alright so it does</font>

851
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:50,099
work oh no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I I already</font>

852
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:53,950
said it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room but a plus one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Falls</font>

853
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:57,940
suggestion that pain does not deal with

854
00:43:53,950 --> 00:44:00,250
this at all but the addresses in

855
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,990
whatever forms you want and that's it

856
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,770
and then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to look</font>

857
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:09,220
up service that's fine and look up

858
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:10,960
service done elsewhere then you

859
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:16,930
should use deign to secure the look of

860
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:19,380
certain service excellent all right all

861
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:23,799
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> engine how do I turn this off</font>

862
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">great the medical people will kick you</font>

863
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,280
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 minutes left um Henry Sullivan uh</font>

864
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:35,950
what I heard John Levine suggest is that

865
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:37,240
we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like napped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ER to solve</font>

866
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,879
this problem and i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point</font>

867
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,390
out that that was such a fabulously

868
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,280
successful approach for DNS names then

869
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,440
now we're going to export<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a thing</font>

870
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't quite shaped like DNS names I</font>

871
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,510
think that that anything like that won't

872
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,120
work and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably ought to</font>

873
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:58,880
follow Paul's suggestion

874
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,160
and john wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a response please</font>

875
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:07,810
i think what i said was stupid but not

876
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:10,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite that student might know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

877
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:12,680
the suggestion for that mean it could

878
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:16,070
just be a plate meet you can use you can

879
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:20,779
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> nap tur to map all map everything</font>

880
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:25,460
into the same URI which is just all stop

881
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anyway so yeah yeah I'm sorry yeah</font>

882
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,340
I agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree with Chris Lucas coming</font>

883
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:34,520
up behind you TP served or oh good very

884
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,400
a what a what a good recovery Paul

885
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:40,759
please Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Paul</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out cuz I'm one</font>

886
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:44,600
of the document authors first I think in

887
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:47,090
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle external to DNS is a terrible</font>

888
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,220
idea for two reasons one if people are

889
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,960
worried about zone walking in DNS have a

890
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,720
nice oracle for his own walking email

891
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,010
addresses is an even better plan to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

892
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">get a lot of hatred on the net the</font>

893
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:02,750
second is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot detect if I'm under</font>

894
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,460
attack if I cannot reach the Oracle the

895
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:07,010
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about DNS I guess that we</font>

896
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,770
made sure that if his own is signed I

897
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,630
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find the answer that a</font>

898
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,240
record exists or not with cryptographic

899
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,190
proof as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make any kind of</font>

900
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,959
external connection to any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font>

901
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,760
using any other protocol I lose this

902
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,340
property and that's why i asked the

903
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,190
question if an<font color="#E5E5E5"> oracle is required and</font>

904
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,670
and a lot of smtp people are nodding

905
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,230
like it might not be possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

906
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:34,490
this into the dns without consulting

907
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:37,010
with the delivery smtp is it worth doing

908
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:39,709
in Dane that's why i asked the question

909
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,660
if because that's exactly what Dane

910
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,400
would get you but if you can't if you

911
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:47,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do the Oracle look up then is it</font>

912
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:50,000
worth doing pretty presumably<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

913
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,520
get the address of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Oracle look up at</font>

914
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know using Dame and get the cert for</font>

915
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,820
the article assuming you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you</font>

916
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:58,040
got it and then so many blocks port 80

917
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,080
or port 777 or whatever the Oracle runs

918
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,870
on a now under attackers as a network

919
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">outage I don't know and leaving is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

920
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS SEC is is where it should be because</font>

921
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,590
then i know i will either get the key or

922
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,750
I'll get proves that the key

923
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:13,030
doesn't exist so I think any decisions

924
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:15,250
that funds this to it to secondary

925
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:19,050
services a bad idea so does this take

926
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:21,790
you to being<font color="#E5E5E5"> to saying what Paul said</font>

927
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,140
that you look up what you have and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

928
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:28,300
doesn't if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get it you don't</font>

929
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:31,480
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well that my next step was so so</font>

930
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:33,730
my second comment is that I'm yes so we

931
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,560
we can then say<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited to just what the</font>

932
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,000
user typed in and do that but we're all

933
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,100
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's gonna ignore</font>

934
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,690
that because you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use my iphone</font>

935
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,190
right now and I tried send anyone to do

936
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,840
in the room here and email it will

937
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,240
capitalize the first letter and we'll be

938
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,010
screwed so so people sure they will add

939
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,959
see names for a further only the first

940
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,970
capitalization and people might add

941
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,940
other see names to map up multiple rules

942
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,770
which is fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think people will</font>

943
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,300
start mapping rules that are more

944
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:01,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">complicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we might not be able to</font>

945
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,470
to prevent them from doing it and we can

946
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">just make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're violating</font>

947
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,399
RFC i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's much value</font>

948
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,250
in that but to come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">paragraph of text in the are in the</font>

950
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,310

mentioning any rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pretending this</font>

952
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,210

of these texts solutions we can at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

958
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:37,779
move forward if we're going to off the

959
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:39,460
way of you know extending smtp ordering

960
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,190
Oracle's we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years further and</font>

961
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:47,500
frankly I'm you're telling the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors</font>

962
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:49,300
to go to txt records and because I see

963
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,090
other people in the queue who might have

964
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,010
answers to this question but<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so we've</font>

965
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,470
mentioned an Oracle going to the smtp

966
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:00,160
server and asking it a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> live is</font>

967
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:03,160
it also plausible or operationally

968
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,009
plausible for the smtp server to be the

969
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,720
thing that stands up the dns records in

970
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,070
question here and maybe that's a

971
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,560
non-starter because we know that

972
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,570
separation of powers that tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on</font>

973
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,810
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might also be the only way to</font>

974
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,840
approach the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm happy to</font>

975
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,840
hear

976
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,959
and John's comment was his gmail address

977
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,529
that's five hundred thousand ways to

978
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,970
spell it right if you want case and

979
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,400
sensitivity that's going to be the

980
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,618
problem please so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

981
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">left so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric ah swell in verisign so</font>

982
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,710
you'll we we actually wrote some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

983
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,970
software only<font color="#CCCCCC"> played around a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

984
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,230
and that doesn't make me any better than

985
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,060
anybody else but what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

986
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,500
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think perfect is definitely the</font>

987
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,540
enemy the good here I think we have

988
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">something whereby if you find keying</font>

989
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,960
material you can use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

990
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,460
find it because you put a caps in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong place you can try again or you</font>

00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,670
don't get the key material you couldn't

993
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,470
get any way but there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

994
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,840
that we get for free right away if I get

995
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,430
an email that's signed I got the address

996
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,960
in there I can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that address to</font>

997
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,669
verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signature so we're talking</font>

998
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,800
about encryption probably and that's

999
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,240
fine but I think what we can do now is

1000
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,130
we can actually move forward without

1001
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,569
deciding we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix everything a</font>

1002
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,400
hundred percent come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> oracle's</font>

1003
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,440
and grammars and nothing else we just

1004
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,550
try it and we can get something going

1005
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,930
that's really really useful there's a

1006
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,670
lot of crypto that we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

1007
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that suddenly we realized like</font>

1008
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,730
getting cert synced across devices is a

1009
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,779
really big deal we've all known about

1010
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,790
for a long time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that we can</font>

1011
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually use the crypto we're running</font>

1012
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,089
the real problems that we have to solve

1013
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,830
that would think through so I really

1014
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:31,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">worry about us reading and trying to do</font>

1015
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:33,848
one hundred percent solution here I'll

1016
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,560
say I disagree with you on<font color="#E5E5E5"> verifying the</font>

1017
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:37,240
signature part that has the same look uh

1018
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,910
problem well but I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email address</font>

1019
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,950
and it had well I have the opportunity

1020
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:44,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get it right but either way I think</font>

1021
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and solve it to the to</font>

1023
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:54,790
play with it and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably get</font>

1024
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:58,240
it wrong after you hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Hodges um so</font>

anywhere on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet any domain</font>

1029
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:12,069
right and I just somehow get it I need

1030
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,140
to be on the question is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so everything that's</font>

1033
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:27,400
been said about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Milan in the queue here</font>

1034
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:28,869
about local parts and looking up natural

1035
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,619
names or things derived from natural

1036
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:34,420
names is correct it's a total mess on I

1037
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:34,990
deployed the directory service at

that's still out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web i can send a</font>

1048
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:08,589
helpful on a pragmatic question is so

1049
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,360
you have an enterprise with hundred

1050
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:12,369
thousand hundreds of thousands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1051
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,360
in the directory and you're going to

1052
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:17,470
store all those keys in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns server</font>

1053
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:22,780
how's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work that's</font>

1054
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to think about um what else</font>

1055
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,730
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on time yeah okay but</font>

1056
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway you have them it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sight how</font>

1057
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,200
it all works is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> site-specific and</font>

1058
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:35,229
on and there's multiple local local

1059
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:40,779
parts for people also like it's on at

1060
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:43,720
Stanford I had seven local parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> Keith</font>

1061
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:45,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">more when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about trying to map</font>

1062

large numbers of email addresses into

1063
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,930
the DNS zone the thing that I'm reminded

1064
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately is that how often DNS is out</font>

1065
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,740
of sync<font color="#CCCCCC"> with reality it's a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1066
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,390
because the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> run DNS servers</font>

1067
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,770
tend to be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the people</font>

1068
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">running mail servers and so on and so</font>

1069
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:00,220
forth I<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the question dns is</font>

1070
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,310
absolutely the wrong place to put this

1071
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:04,899
information in any form and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary MX servers or using them</font>

1074

1075
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,779
ways you can slice and dice it but I'm

1076
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,550
pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't belong in DNS I'm</font>

1077
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:21,070
also pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the work doesn't belong</font>

I mean there's dots in them there's case

1083

there's internationalized characters

still be done in Dane but not as part of

00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:01,220
this document as an Oracle so what four

minutes left so hi Daniel<font color="#CCCCCC"> con Gilmore</font>

brief points<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not convinced that this</font>

00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:13,740
a point that Paul raised simply because

1129
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:16,260
currently there is no I mean any signs

1130
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:18,270
own there are no pgp key records or no s

<font color="#E5E5E5">prime records so when I look it up it</font>

1132
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't mean that that user account has</font>

1133
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,850
no key it simply means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

1134
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">published in the DNS so I'm not sure</font>

1135
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that that is a goal of this</font>

1136
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:30,540
particular work right now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way</font>

1137
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,430
of signaling that this that a key

1138
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:35,070
doesn't exist for that user secondly I

1139
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,569
wanted to point out that this problem

1140
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">already exists for people who are doing</font>

1142
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:42,450
stores or key stores or whatever and

1143
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:45,450
they look them up however they look them

1144
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:47,430
up locally and it's an existing problem

1145
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,930
we shouldn't solve the problem I think

1146
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,310
the hashing is necessary I think the

1147
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say how to do</font>

1148
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:54,150
the case holding a silly but but we're

1149
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,160
leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's definitely no worse off</font>

1150
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,950
than they were before if we say go ahead

1151
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,170
and and just look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the string that you</font>

1152
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:04,950
got my third point and then I'll be done

1153
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that the DNS until</font>

1154
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:10,109
deprived complete successfully DNS has

00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,930
privacy leakage implications when you're

1156
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:15,390
doing your lookups and I guess if we

1157
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:18,210
were to go choose a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> like look</font>

the Oracle especially smtp<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle as I'm</font>

1170
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:52,800
the Oracle in general is it opening door

1171
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:56,310
for spammers to discover a look exact

1179
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,879
the comment about someone getting a

letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling them</font>

1181
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,430
to put in a different key something that

00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:22,559
in s sec provides us with is

1183
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,140
transparency for that case because you

1184
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,690
can go and query your own record meaning

1185
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,819
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it right if you analyze your</font>

own query for your own record you will

1187
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:33,660
notice that someone did get that letter

1188
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:38,879
and that is an important feature I think

1189

my mom's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to do that solves</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that for two people so erik oster</font>

1191
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:46,019
welcome so um I definitely want to stand

1192
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,640
on what I said before about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

1193
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:49,709
thing and the enemy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good what not</font>

1194
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,210
but just one sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of point when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

1195
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:53,190
playing with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S my stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we put</font>

00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI pointer in there that was mainly</font>

1197
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,680
so that we could reach our corporate

1198
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:57,839
infrastructure we could deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1199
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,730
example a wild card the mill domain and

1200
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,019
allow that wild card to reference

1201
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:02,460
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you could go King</font>

1202
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:04,169
material you could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font>

1203
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oracle or something else as well where</font>

1204
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">by your new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top level says for users</font>

1205
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,859
underneath me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here and I'll</font>

1206
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,269
secure the transaction by having the

1207
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:13,859
crypto in there whatever and then you go

1208
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:15,779
and that problems taking care of it can

1209
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:17,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like you said the MTA or you know</font>

1210
00:59:15,779 --> 00:59:19,259
lions tigers bears and that was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1211
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,059
things that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if we just make</font>

1212
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:22,950
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things flexible like we were</font>

1213
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:27,809
proposing with the SYM a record we might

1214
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to experiment figure it out just</font>

1215
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:33,809
by wrap up um I do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

1216
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:38,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as this conversation progresses</font>

1217
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:41,099
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of not Keith made</font>

1218
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,950
a comment about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS can't do certain</font>

1219
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:48,359
things um so this is both about

1220
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">establishing a new dns service and a new</font>

1221
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:55,109
potentially smtp service and so let's be

1222
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:57,480
a little bit broader about if you do

1223
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:59,369
this maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could pull off that ideas</font>

1224
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:04,200
I think that's reasonable point of

1225
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:06,650
discussion but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was useful and more</font>

1226
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:11,578
questions than answers but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1227
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:14,519
so ah thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all thank you very deep</font>

1228
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:17,579
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask a question of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1229
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:20,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">group after talking to Barry if we</font>

1230
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:24,319
consider the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current PGP openpgp</font>

opportunistic pgp key retrieval

1233
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:34,919
you think that this worthwhile

1234
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:38,210
experimental contact and I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1235
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:41,430
home on that or harm on against it I

1236
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:43,200
don't know what I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current</font>

1237
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,750
mechanism of just doing a straight look

01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:49,439
up or whatever you have our three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hasit</font>

1239
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:51,630
to look for a pgp key is a war file

<font color="#E5E5E5">that a document we want to publish like</font>

1242
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:06,869
an opportunistic way of doing it soham

1243
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:09,990
yes mmm those opposed there were a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

1244
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:11,549
this was a stronger hum for then against

1245
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:14,879
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will ask this question on the</font>

1246
01:01:11,549 --> 01:01:17,970
mailing list I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add to that</font>

1247
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,279
question do the people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> um no think</font>

1248
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:23,129
it would be a horrible thing to do or

1249
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:24,509
just not not a very good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1250
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:28,559
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is they think that would really</font>

1251
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:30,509
break things look behind you I think my

1252
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,099
concern will be if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you publish this as a</font>

1253
01:01:30,509 --> 01:01:33,900
document that people will think that

1254
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:36,269
there will eventually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a standard</font>

1255
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,910
along these lines and I think we already

1256
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:40,799
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's inadequate so if you want</font>

1257
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to publish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a document it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be if</font>

1258
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,490
there's a big huge strong disclaimer

1259
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:47,129
that says don't expect things to go this

1260
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:48,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">way but I don't know I actually think</font>

1261
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,839
this is an experiment that might do more

1262
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:55,200
harm than good if it were labeled as an

1263
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:58,230
experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am concerned by the attacks</font>

1264
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:00,569
and I am concerned that if it is an

1265
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:03,960
experiment and it is implemented in some

1266
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:06,538
some piece of software at other someone

1267

can pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> ute a week or that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>
