1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,430
I'm in status so we have pretty much to

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,399
working group documents and another one

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,080
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the slide so the first</font>

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,900
document the GRE empty document we just

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,039
requested publication so Ted was our ad

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,470
and it went on his plate but the working

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,480
group is changing hands to Brian so we

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,150
also briefed Brian now that like it's on

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,210
his plate now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that it's going to</font>

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,790
start moving soon with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad evaluation and</font>

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,380
the other document is like the ipv6 GRE

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,969
document which got adopted since the

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,190
last meeting so it's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> through like</font>

14
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:42,460
two rubs already and it's been actively

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,489
discussed and so Ron is going to present

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,449
like the updates and see whether working

17
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:53,140
group thinks so as you see doesn't

18
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:56,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty tight and so keep your</font>

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,600
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a minimum pretty much so</font>

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,649
like keep it shot and then other stuff

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,680
we can discuss on the mailing list so

22
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:08,619
let Fred get started<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so uh excuse</font>

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,600
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so any agenda bashing so anybody has</font>

24
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:16,500
issues with the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool Fred</font>

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,500
go-ahead run one

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,450
ok

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,240
okay extra so what we see about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnels</font>

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,548
is that encapsulation headers always

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,890
consume data bytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that breaks the</font>

30
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,450
1500 everywhere assumption that seems to

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,789
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevalent in the internet today and</font>

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,200
it's exacerbated by tunnels within

33
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:49,890
tunnels where we have you infer the

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,520
levels of encapsulation tunnels perform

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,100
link adaptation per RFC 2460 when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MT</font>

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,548
was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits efficient so link adaptation</font>

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,500
is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which a box can break up a</font>

38
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,170
packet into pieces that will fit across

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">the link and be reassembled at the far</font>

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,430
side next chart I'm so uphold the 1500

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,230
everywhere assumption one strategy a

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,299
tunnel fingers could employ is that it

43
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,980
could say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller than twelve</font>

44
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,540
eighty minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> in caps we can send without</font>

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,090
fragment and because it's guaranteed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,328
fit within the 1280 bite minimum to you

47
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,280
you anything larger than 1500 bytes we

48
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,860
can send without fragmenting because

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,260
posts that send packets larger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500</font>

50
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,849
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really supposed to be doing RC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4821</font>

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,929
in other words sensing that those

52
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,170
packets are getting through without

53
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,850
being dropped by a black hole anything

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,440
in the middle zone though that's larger

55
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,049
than twelve eighty minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and caps and</font>

56
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,910
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500 might have to use</font>

57
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,040

58
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,850
probe to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether fragmentation is</font>

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,470
still necessary so if fragmentation is

60
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,299
needed though it'd be nice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

61
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,220
somehow tell the original source that

62
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,079
hey your tunnels fragment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,700
nice if you get back off and either

64
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">limit the size of the package you send</font>

65
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,388
or do the fragmentation yourself and

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,959
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I'm calling an advisory</font>

67
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:09,630
packet too big next chart so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

68
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,430
advisory packet too big when the tunnel

69
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,680
has to fragment it can send a packet too

70
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,109
big with a size that's smaller than 1280

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,819
subject to rate limiting it can then

72
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,079
either discard the payload packet and

73
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,208
treat the packet the big as a loss

74
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,000
indication or you can fragment the

75
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,849
delivery packet and treat the packet the

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,530
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> message as an advisory indication so</font>

77
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,238
when a source gets this packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> too big</font>

78
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,780

<font color="#CCCCCC">include a fragment header in future</font>

82

of the packets it sends below 1280 and

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,690
that's per RFC 2460

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,250
unfortunately not all sources do this

85
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,950
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources that don't do it are</font>

86
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,020
non-compliant so the source could

87
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,970
instead of doing that reduce the size of

88
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the packets it sends to a size smaller</font>

89
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,200
than twelve eighty or it could fragment

90
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,570
future packets that are no larger than

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">1,500 so the tunneling you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

92
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,769
doesn't have to fragment so that's

93
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,010
that's the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what an advisory</font>

147
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,020
the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to generate</font>

148
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:27,520
some discussion on it sounds good thanks

149
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok thank you rom ok second lightning</font>

150
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,370
present second lightning presentation um

151
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,940
we were working on a draft a couple

152
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,940
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gip v6</font>

153
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,800
payload<font color="#CCCCCC"> over GRE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and GRE over ipv6 and</font>

154
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,050
somebody pointed out that there's no

155
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:49,480
standard for either so we decided to

156
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:51,670
remedy that next slide so we wrote a

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,090
draft last IETF it was adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

158
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,140
working group item we got lots of

159
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,450
conversation on the mailing list between

160
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,200
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I etfs from Fred Joe told Lucy</font>

161
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,670
and Tom Herbert and we had a few changes

162
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,289
which are summarized in the next two

163
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:10,570
slides first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> checksum text when the</font>

164
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,000
delivery protocol is ipv6 the GRE

165
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,480
ingress should set the checksum present

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,720
field 20 the GRE egress router must

167
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,780
accept the value of either 0 or 1 and if

168
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,970
the GRE egress receives a value of one

169
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,429
it must use that information to

170
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,530
calculate length<font color="#E5E5E5"> however it's not used</font>

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,740

181

must discard the payload send an ICMP

189
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:27,260
PTP back to the origin and let's say

190
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,500
whoops those bullets bullet shouldn't be

191
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,960
there and the MTU field should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> set to</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to fragment and the gmt you is</font>

199
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,500
by default you drop the packet and send

200
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,050
an ICMP packet back to the source

201
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,280
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a configuration option</font>

202
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:09,979
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the ingress that says rather</font>

203
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,430
than doing that I'm going to fragment

204
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,040
the delivery up encapsulate the payload

205
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,709
in a single GRE header and fragment the

206
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,959
delivery header the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior is</font>

207
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,480
to drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet and send an ICMP back</font>

208
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,520
to the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> the non default behavior</font>

209
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:33,470
is to fragment the<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivery header next</font>

210
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:36,140
slide so it's a painfully short draft

211
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,330
all of six<font color="#E5E5E5"> or eight pages lots of</font>

212
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,400
discussion we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

213
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,880
working group last call but we have lots

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of comments Eric so Eric not mark so did</font>

215
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,780
I read your slide your previous slide

216
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,370
correctly that you said the default is

217
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,439
to throw those packets away even though

218
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,300
they're perfectly valid pockets yes the

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,280
default is to discard them and send an

220
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,040
ICMP back the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host will ignore that</font>

221
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,240
because it's less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve eighty yes</font>

222
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,560
um so that's no service that's true now

223
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,730
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I don't have a</font>

224
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the knob i have a problem</font>

225
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,180
of the default setting but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see</font>

226
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,990
that's what we're arguing about which is

227
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is the most likely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> serrio i'm</font>

228
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,950
thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's such an odd situation</font>

229
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,250
to have a gmt you less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve</font>

230
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,590
eighty that maybe you won't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

231
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,089
think about what's going on but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

232
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,740
it's not so odd the default

233
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,279
configuration is backwards and it should

234
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">be the other way well yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

235
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,959
because you basically are telling the

236
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,339
hose that me is to provide of the tunnel

237
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,399
I'm screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that I'm telling you that</font>

238
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:40,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm screwed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up right because my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gmt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

239
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,170
is is too low right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you're</font>

240
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:43,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to tell yourself not tell the</font>

241
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">host because the hose can't really do</font>

242
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,029
anything about it I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly happy</font>

243
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,309
just happy to switch which the Fate

244
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,839
behavior is the default looking at her

245
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,980
input from the working group just tell

246
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,269
me which and I'll make it happen I'd

247
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,249
like a few people to come to the mic and

248
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,699
tell me which to do I had another one

249
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:05,509
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you might have any draft so</font>

250
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:10,279
the GRE checksum is only for the GRE

251
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:11,720
header right so how its defined I mean

252
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,449
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about pseudo</font>

253
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,459
header checksum for other things one of

254
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:19,609
the distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between I seen Peavy 49</font>

255
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,920
MP v6 is that nobody we include a pseudo

256
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,680
header checksum to deal with bit

257
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,930
corruption in an outer ipv6 delivery

258
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,649
header all right are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same</font>

259
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,420
thing here and would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it make sense</font>

260
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it might be incompatible with</font>

261
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,769
our people due tre over ipv6 today I

262
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:40,689
would be surprised if no one has already

263
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,709
implemented if no one has what I I

264
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:45,800
despite people have already implemented

265
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:48,018
GRE over ipv6 but I don't know no hats

266
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,628
but the GRE chick some contains the

267
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">chicken of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> path header and the</font>

268
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,519
payload yeah my question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about</font>

269
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,709
pseudo header versus not and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

270
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,300
that that train sailed many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

271
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:07,128
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fine hi Tom Herbert I do have a</font>

272
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">question about the checks and would you</font>

273
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,990
mind from would you might keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into</font>

274
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,059
them sorry yeah squirt I had a question

275
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,929
about the checksum can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

276
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:21,019
slide for a second so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a</font>

277
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:23,240
discussion on the mailing list and I

278
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:25,999
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was that if the</font>

279
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,120
checksum is present that the receiver

280
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,470
must validate it and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem</font>

281
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,179
to be what you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

282
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,750
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Suresh is the guy who answered</font>

283
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,870
that so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let him speak for himself</font>

284
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,460
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in I think</font>

285
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:45,260
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a present okay we'll make</font>

286
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:49,340
that change<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you oh let's run</font>

287
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,260
so for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GMT you I think it would be a</font>

288
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:55,730
violation y pues expects if you didn't

289
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,140
provide a 1280 empty for a v6 link so

290
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to ensure that I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

291
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,040
sorry could you repeat that please it

292
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,560
would violate the IPC expects if you

293
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,160
cannot provide a link layer that offers

294
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:11,000
1280 empty you larger so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

295
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,020
have to ensure that so I'm checking you

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,900
know Eric's co<font color="#CCCCCC"> calculates it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

297
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,850
with regards to the fragmentations 2473

298
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,220
has quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that are you</font>

299
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,930
could you ensure that you are reasonably

300
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,260
in line with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so we don't create two</font>

301
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:31,930
different ways of fragment thing you

302
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:34,069
know after<font color="#CCCCCC"> an inner payloads here and</font>

303
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:40,010
thirdly there are many implementations

304
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:41,870
of you know I 36 GRE you can we also do

305
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,050
some work to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

306
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,760
creating an aspect here that is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

307
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,219
not interoperable with the existing

308
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementations okay I'll answer all</font>

309
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,270
three so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like we have two</font>

310
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,140
action items first is to switch the

311
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:01,220
default on what we do when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gmt you</font>

312
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,750
is small second is to say yes we will if

313
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,010
you receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a checksum you must use it</font>

314
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,770
to verify integrity now the third as for

315
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,319
existing implementations yes there are

316
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:15,199
existing implementations and they do

317
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,650
what the draft currently says the

318
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,360
default is to discard the packet so yeah

319
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:25,810
we have a choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing what existing</font>

320
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,670
implementations do or do the right thing

321
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,829
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that gmt you has</font>

322
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,229
to be larger equal or larger than 1280

323
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,230
which you know might imply<font color="#CCCCCC"> outro</font>

324
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,120
fragmentation here and to the chairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

325
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,280
think we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lost</font>

326
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,170
call this or at least notified<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 my list</font>

327
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:48,279
as well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes through thank you</font>

328
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean if there's a knob there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric Nam</font>

329
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,970
marc ian if there's a knob there and

330
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,279
basically saying your existing

331
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,589
implementations might not have that knob

332
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,500
and basically be hard-coded he have it

333
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:01,690
be in setting one right well the adverse

334
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,250
it the existing implementations have the

335
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,769
knob it's just the default value<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

336
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,420
we're arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah then that's sort</font>

337
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:09,370
of like throw that they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be easy for</font>

338
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,860
people to adjust their implementations

339
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,269
yeah so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll say is the default</font>

340
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:24,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">value should be to fragment that</font>

341
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:26,500
delivery<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so we will make those</font>

342
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,699
actually it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two changes</font>

343
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,560
changing the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> value and arm</font>

344
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,000
checking the check zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll submit the</font>

345
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,079
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we'll ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a working</font>

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">group last call and also simultaneous</font>

347
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:47,910
last call and sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> man all done thanks</font>

348
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,910
next victim please

349
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,150
that's it

350
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,480
so no

351
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:10,279
hi my name is Tom<font color="#E5E5E5"> Herbert and going to</font>

352
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pink penalty box we do that's like a</font>

353
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,800
thing also in a box magic box step out

354
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,420
of the box and it moves it rejected so

355
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,930
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to do another lightning</font>

356
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:25,399
talk this is generic UDP encapsulation

357
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:28,760
it's a protocol kind of what it says

358
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,560
next slide please so basically what

359
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,680
we're trying to do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a generic</font>

360
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,339
extensible flexible and capsulation

361
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,529
mechanism and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually came out of</font>

362
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:42,529
network virtualization however we did

363
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:44,600
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could expand that and</font>

364
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:50,000
basically have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

365
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:52,930
protocol next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so generic UDP</font>

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,970
encapsulations its roots lie in GRE

367
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,430
protocol looks a lot like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> jiri</font>

368
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,579
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> well established while</font>

369
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,949
deployed very simple so we like that in

370
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:07,490
large deployments unfortunately we've

371
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:10,339
kind of hit a wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> with GRE basically</font>

372
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:14,599
it's really difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend so we</font>

373
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,980
found a way to extend it by somewhat

374
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,688
overloading the texan feel and the

375
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,780
sequence number<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail in the key ID field</font>

376
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:24,049
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and even if we add</font>

377
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,639
at new fields on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edges middle boxes</font>

378
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:28,069
that need to do d parsing wouldn't

379
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,960
understand these new fields basically

380
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the GRE header length is</font>

381
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,500
computed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by interpreting the field bits</font>

382
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,809
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU kind of you can think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of as a</font>

383
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,110
successor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> GRE or potential successor</font>

384
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:44,980
and in it we try to keep the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

385
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,209
of simplicity and extensibility we want

386
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,669
opportunities to extend the protocol so

387
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:53,150
that's a big part of this and why we're

388
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,650
at it add a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvements you know</font>

389
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,910
that you might have wish we had in GRE

390
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:02,059
next slide so this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of the</font>

391
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:04,400
features as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned will use flag</font>

392
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:07,490
fields much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jerry so if bit set it</font>

393
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,690
refers to a field we had a header length

394
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,910
this is the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows</font>

395
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,269
middleboxes to basically basically skip

396
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:17,149
over unknown<font color="#E5E5E5"> fields to do deep parsing</font>

397
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:20,989
the next header is indicated by IP

398
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:22,958
protocol instead of ethertype we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

399
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:25,909
few interesting uses for that and also

400
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:29,139
saving those<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight bits from the ether</font>

401
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:32,330
types actually worth it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> header</font>

402
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:33,349
this is fundamental UDP encapsulation so

403
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,989
it's much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other you team</font>

404
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:39,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">capsule ations so we kind of get ecmp</font>

405
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:42,349
for free there we have a concept of data

406
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:44,330
messages and control messages security

407
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:46,820
is a big part of this so we actually

408
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,639
define a security field kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of optional</font>

409
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,089
but this is used to authenticate headers

410
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:54,978
in certain environments yeah checksum we

411
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:57,259
have a checksum like jury although this

412
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:59,690
is kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the improved checksum so it</font>

413
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:01,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">includes the pseudo header and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its UDP</font>

414
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:05,119
light so that the checksum is only over

415
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:06,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the header and this solves problem and</font>

416
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,749
switches where they don't want to

417
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,919
compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full package checksum but</font>

418
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:12,889
still want to have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of checks</font>

419
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,649
them over the header hardly<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

420
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:17,958
friendliness was considered obviously

421
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:19,820
GRE<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hardware friendly by the fact</font>

422
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:21,799
it's deployed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying things</font>

423
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,989
that parse it so we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hopeful</font>

424
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,059
that that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue and as I</font>

425
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:30,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have support for network</font>

426
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:33,589
virtualization it's like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

427
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:35,899
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much detail over the gue</font>

428
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:39,649
headers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the normal version</font>

429
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:41,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">and header length protocol next field c</font>

430
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:44,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit indicates whether it's a control</font>

431
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,629
message or data message and then 16 bits

432
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:50,299
of flags and this last flag is actually

433
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:52,639
kind of special it allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extend</font>

434
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,709
the flags field so that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

435
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:57,199
limited to 16 bits we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

436
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:59,119
extend that to another 32 bits so

437
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,359
conceptually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this over and over</font>

438
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,949
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as many bits as you want</font>

439
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,379
so it is you know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think a</font>

440
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,629
little bit forward hopefully we won't

441
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:14,718
wind up with hundreds of flags but it

442
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:16,820
allows for that next play UDP so as I

443
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,379
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can use a source port for</font>

444
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,460
entropy much like other European

445
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">consolations UDP checksum very similar</font>

to the MPLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> over UDP over UDP</font>

447
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,279
same provisions however since we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

448
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:34,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add a header checksum</font>

449
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:37,519
within the encapsulation that may

450
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,929
mitigate certain circumstances where we

451
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,429
wish we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> texan but we</font>

452
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:48,559
can't because of the switch

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:51,649
compatibility next<font color="#E5E5E5"> lane so primary goo</font>

454
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,418
header so I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail here as I</font>

455
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:56,268
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the header length to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">see type field serves two purposes</font>

458
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,409
either it's an IP protocol or control

459
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:07,460
type and that's distinguished by the sea

460
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:10,100
sea but next slide so just kind of an

461
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:14,870
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the headers I already</font>

462
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:19,759
mentioned that next slide more on the

463
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">undersea bit next slide please so I will</font>

464
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,519
mention about the flags this is kind of

465
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,559
an important part of the extensibility

466
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:31,429
and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are very careful</font>

467
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:33,230
about the flags is to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

468
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:35,419
have forward compatibility and one of

469
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,210
the rules about the flags is if a flag

470
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,340
bit is set and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsule later does</font>

471
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,710
not understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flag bit packet is</font>

472
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,649
dropped so this solves a lot of problems

473
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,950
where if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to add a flag safer the</font>

474
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:50,539
checksum receiver gets that and doesn't

475
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,340
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of just ignoring</font>

476
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,019
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in organic cut some which would be a</font>

477
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad thing it will actually drop the</font>

478
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:59,480
packet so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an assumption here of</font>

479
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:03,340
the ability to either synchronize or

480
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,299
configure these things upfront and so

481
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,269
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of skip the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next three</font>

482
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:10,070
slides so this is some more detail on

483
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:12,950
the flags in the fields and what we're

484
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to accomplish there so the</font>

485
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,590
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> is designed to be extensible</font>

486
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:21,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in fact we have already defined five</font>

487
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,199
extensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual virtual network</font>

488
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,309
identifier is for network virtualization

489
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
this is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing we found</font>

490
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:30,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific to network virtualization is</font>

491
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:34,549
that it needs this 32-bit identifier

492
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,379
security field as I mentioned this is

493
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,389
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow either security cookie</font>

494
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,110
potentially a secure hash over the

495
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,750
header

496
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,629
it is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a multi length field to</font>

497
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,250
allow some expansion in the future

498
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,220
header checksum<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already mentioned</font>

499
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,460
remote checksum offload is a little

500
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,200
optimization this is based on the fact

501
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,150
that there's already a large deployment

502
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,750
of network interface cards<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick's</font>

503
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,059
basically that support UDP fix them off

504
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,400
load but wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily understand</font>

505
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,270
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support something like goo so</font>

506
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,150
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little trick where we can</font>

507
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:11,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage these you debase UDP</font>

508
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,780
support of the outer checksum to offload

509
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,260
the inner checksum tunnel fragmentation

510
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,290
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fred actually alluded to this we</font>

511
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually came up with a design to do a</font>

512
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,240
tunnel fragmentation this is kind of

513
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of has some improvements over IP</font>

514
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,679
fragmentation so for instance we can do

515
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:34,309
a 32-bit identification instead of

516
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,429
16-bit identification so that's kind of

517
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,889
promising there are a number of

518
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:43,520
potential possibilities here and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

519
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:45,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a normal what are the value</font>

520
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,629
value here we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

521
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,350
that anything added is is generic as

522
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,059
possible and in fact some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

523
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:56,120
fields like a virtual network<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier</font>

524
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:57,379
security field can be fine in such a way

525
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,739
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reused so for instance</font>

526
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,270
security we could have a 64-bit field

527
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,010
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could use different algorithms</font>

528
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,290
for that and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to specify</font>

529
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,720
specify that<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront in the definition</font>

530
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:11,090
of the security field so it's kind of

531
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">like repurposing the GRE key ID we can</font>

532
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:17,240
extend that model to some other fields

533
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:19,370
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide private David data Regent so</font>

534
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,760
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another feature that we added</font>

535
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:26,959
kind of to enhance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Giri</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model a little</font>

536
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,990
bit this allows after the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> leg and</font>

537
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">before the payload if there is space and</font>

538
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,880
they're determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the header length</font>

539
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:37,250
this can be arbitrary private data that

540
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,100
is inserted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the sender and understood</font>

541
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the receiver so it can be a community</font>

542
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,379
structure we have one case<font color="#E5E5E5"> where people</font>

543
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,059
are putting tlv is in there whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

544
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:51,620
says it's fine so that's kind of kind of

545
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:55,010
neat next slide the status

546
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,600
so we have three primary drafts plus a

547
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,750
few that describes some of the

548
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,570
extensions the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goo draft is the base</font>

549
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,850
draft and that describes pretty much the

550
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,909
protocol as is the network

551
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,110
virtualization draft is specific or the

552
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,530
MBO is specific to the network

553
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,740
virtualization extensions and we have a

554
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:18,350
security draft describing the field we

555
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,690
have a port assignment this is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

556
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,540
upstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux so you can test it out if</font>

557
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:28,820
you wish we actually support IP IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> / goo</font>

558
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:29,809
GRE over go SI t / go so one of the

559
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,280
reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come today</font>

560
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:36,200
actually had a question basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> wick</font>

561
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,750
working group should we consider this to

562
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,330
be on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's one of my</font>

563
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,970
fundamental question we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dap f</font>

564
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,730
asked for adoption in NV 03 and that's

565
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going pretty well but unlike some of the</font>

566
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,770
other protocols in NV 03 this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

567
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,270
intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a generic encapsulation</font>

568
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,240
protocol that supports network

569
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:59,059
virtualization as opposed to a network

570
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:04,970
virtualization protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so our</font>

571
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:08,420
thoughts so yeah well well Carlos una

572
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:11,690
gang no had questions that did you

573
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,390
attend that the this put words<font color="#E5E5E5"> put off</font>

574
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,760
on tuesday when we were discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

575
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,460
from the privacy point of view this idea

576
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:24,020
of hiding information press and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> spud</font>

577
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:26,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">puff yeah yes I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was there and yes I do</font>

578
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,059
believe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could easily kind of be</font>

579
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:31,460
contort it to do transport encapsulation

580
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,649
also so before that we only consider the

581
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,540
tunnel encapsulation this is very

582
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,220
similar to spot and in fact I think

583
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,889
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some things we do need that</font>

584
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">spud mentioned like that magic number to</font>

585
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,210
allow middleboxes 22<font color="#E5E5E5"> I positively</font>

586
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,670
identify that this is actually

587
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:49,429
encapsulation so can parse it so I think

588
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good addition but if you</font>

589
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:54,440
kind of peel back the onion these become

590
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,660
very very similar at some point if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

591
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,900
if not the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance one other</font>

592
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,660
thing we need here is probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls the</font>

593
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,150
original security draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ipsec but i</font>

594
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,670
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> dtls is</font>

595
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,040
much more compelling with the UDP based

596
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,690
protocols we probably have that in which

597
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,280
case the packets would probably almost

598
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,290
look identical you couldn't tell the

599
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,300
difference between the tunnel and a

600
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,950
transport encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're the</font>

601
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,750
payloads both encrypted all you have is

602
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">some sort of encapsulation header I</font>

603
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,640
don't know if that was your question but

604
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,110
well yeah yeah wait is he what what what

605
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,160
those are because<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely there's a</font>

606
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:31,449
lot of relationship or overlap or

607
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,750
coordination mention in the pod<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

608
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,520
there's kind of parallel efforts here

609
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,380
and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this comes back to UDP</font>

610
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,490
encapsulation there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

611
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,190
commonalities and we should try to

612
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:48,850
leverage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks yes basic oh yes</font>

613
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:51,400
I can my question is am I don't know if

614
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:55,600
you did you define a tunnel

615
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,740
establishment procedure no<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

616
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,490
control plane is considered higher layer

617
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:06,520
this is only describing a data plane the

618
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,170
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in theory people did so but</font>

619
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,720
they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> establish their</font>

control comment lining<font color="#CCCCCC"> command line</font>

621
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,750
interface you can on creativity so can

622
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,760
create a retail but I'm not sure how do

623
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,060
you do with the good so what is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

624
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,610
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define the the tunnel</font>

625
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:29,590
establishment procedure in the industry

626
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:32,469
itself I see so in one in one sense it's

627
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:35,050
similar to GRE so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can figure both ends</font>

628
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,770
of a tunnel and provide the parameters

629
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:41,320
and then I can talk GRE between them

630
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:43,150
there's other interesting use cases so

631
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,409
for instance I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> threads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font>

632
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:49,060
but we have talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possibility</font>

633
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:51,670
that arrow would actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> GU as the</font>

634
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,740
underlay encapsulation and then the

635
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,930
management of the tunnels would be arrow

636
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,930
and from that point of view we consider

637
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:02,290
kind of arrow or in the case of n via

638
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:04,900
three network virtualization to be the

639
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:08,379
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the encapsulation and the</font>

640
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,000
control plane is deferred to that layer

641
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,360
so there's a clear separation here

642
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,600
between data plane and control plane so

643
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,429
that so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

644
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,020
really planning on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

645
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,180
actually makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to have the</font>

646
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,670
separation keep this has just

647
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,850
encapsulation properties of

648
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,590
encapsulation and then above that but

649
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,540
then people who want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they come</font>

650
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,330
up they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem right how do i</font>

651
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,730
establish so then everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> will come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

652
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a different protocol so it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

653
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem like I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we already</font>

654
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,629
have GRE we've lived without having a

655
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,850
control plane for GRE it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

656
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">established in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every I'm almost a rotor</font>

657
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,949
vendor I think they support command line

658
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,770
interface for that so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

659
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:56,740
anticipate what happen is there will be

660
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:59,350
another layer either arrow or some

661
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,810
generic tunneling kind of control layer

662
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:05,350
network virtualization maybe we should I

663
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:08,530
didn't afterward so what happening we

664
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to get to that too so I went to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">draft but he said like he had like</font>

666
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,770
extensibility issues with GRE right like

667
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,000
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly defined what do you</font>

668
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,540
want to extend the GRE that was

669
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult i can give you the precise</font>

670
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,340
example and why we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented</font>

671
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,980
this at Google was response to our

672
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,230
attempts to turn up network

673
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:33,670
virtualization so network virtualization

674
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:35,980
we needed a protocol and one requirement

675
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,980
that we had that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't satisfied by any</font>

676
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:43,630
existing protocols the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exelon or envy</font>

677
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:46,630
GRE was we needed a security token so we

678
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,580
needed to prevent some mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent</font>

679
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">any spoofing basically and guarantee the</font>

680
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,510
integrity of the virtual network

681
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:54,310
identifier problem was if the virtual

682
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,250
network identifier became corrupted

683
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,490
packets could go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong tenant</font>

684
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,050
this is a serious breach of kind of our

685
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,350
first requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network fertilization</font>

686
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:08,050
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to add have to add something</font>

687
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,929
GRE is the most common I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

688
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:14,379
commonly deployed encapsulation we would

689
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:16,270
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend that but jury besides the</font>

690
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,760
key ID really doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any usable</font>

691
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,889
fields that we could put the security in

692
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,050
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to hack it and overload</font>

693
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,870
some of those fields but pretty quickly

694
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">even even if we manage to do that well</font>

695
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,830
we still would like a header checksum so

696
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,510
GRE check some very

697
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,600
it's just the payload doesn't even have

698
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,919
a pseudo pseudo header checksum so can

699
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,070
we have a header checksum that was

700
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,450
actually one of the suggestions from the

701
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">fragmentation and tunneling problem so</font>

702
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start to go down that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> path and</font>

703
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:45,549
realize wow you know if if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">to create a new protocol let's make sure</font>

705
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's extensible and you know hopefully</font>

706
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:55,059
last 30 years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can predict we can</font>

707
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:56,490
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet the requirements in the future</font>

708
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,690
we can't predict for something like this

709
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,010
security I think is a big one security

710
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,960
is only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get tighter and tighter</font>

711
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,820
in the data center so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

712
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,549
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more opportunities</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cutlass next and then sorry I</font>

715
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:16,179
again no hat the there's two aspects to

716
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,039
it one isn't the network or the virtual

717
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:20,679
network identifier and then there's also

718
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the privacy so my comment goes more to</font>

719
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,370
towards the privacy and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

720
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:26,529
your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what working group</font>

721
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,959
should this be and there's several

722
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:30,610
efforts right now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on the</font>

723
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,779
privacy like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're running this this</font>

724
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,729
market restaurant on my station

725
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:37,169
experiment layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two but then there's</font>

726
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:40,779
also drafts for ipv6 address privacy

727
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:43,899
settings then we're talking about while

728
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:46,120
doing this and I p but layer 34 but also

729
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:48,279
we have talks with w3c on the higher

730
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,268
layers seems to me that we actually

731
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,649
require quite a bit of coordination and

732
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:55,450
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do the right thing</font>

733
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:58,389
when it comes to privacy features and

734
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,610
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what this point in time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

735
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">one single group can answer a question</font>

736
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:05,049
we just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

737
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,549
overlap with spot and the you know the

738
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,789
fact that there's there could be some

739
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:12,190
overlap or or relations or need to

740
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:15,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">coordinate let's say between the two so</font>

741
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:17,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that um in some sense it</font>

742
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:21,730
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been nice if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could have</font>

743
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:24,250
put this into either IP options or ipv6

744
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,159
extension headers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then we run into</font>

745
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:30,639
the common problem against which support

746
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,830
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and so I know Eric probably</font>

747
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:35,250
has feeling about this too but one one

748
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:39,340
thing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> an encapsulation header in</font>

749
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,370
theory we can solve problems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

750
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,908
right so we could never extend IP

751
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,008
options because

752
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:46,509
just don't support it but we could start

753
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,919
to put this stuff in encapsulation

754
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:49,809
headers i'm not i'm not advocating that

755
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,539
I think it's a slippery slope so we

756
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:55,440
definitely need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of diligence about</font>

757
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:58,389
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put these things in this case</font>

758
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,249
the security actually is tightly

759
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:03,090
associated with a virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

760
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:05,830
identifier so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> those to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

761
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,809
logically together that they are wanting

762
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:11,020
the same I cannot accept the virtual

763
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:14,409
network identifier without the security

764
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,329
saying it's it's valid so that's that

765
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:18,490
there was a tight coupling to those and

766
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:20,289
there may be alternatives but this was

767
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,399
actually pretty simple but interpreted

768
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:25,169
on the same you ensure the trust

769
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:27,848
relationship with it with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network or</font>

770
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:31,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's some authentication to the to</font>

771
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:33,579
the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> network because then if you</font>

772
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:36,368
are binding the two then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

773
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:39,309
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mechanism to also make sure</font>

774
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the network is trustworthy the</font>

775
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:45,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">network to be able to parse to them so</font>

776
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:48,760
middle yeah so rule is middleboxes may

777
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,200
inspect the headers they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have to</font>

778
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,639
understand all of the bits they should

779
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,520
not drop it if they don't understand

780
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:57,069
something they can inspect it however

781
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,538
they really can't change it and security

782
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:00,009
probably prevents that because security

783
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:02,710
Zhen nan so if they change the bits

784
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,289
it'll break the security but we do allow

785
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,549
for middleboxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parsis if somebody wants</font>

786
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:08,470
a firewall based on the virtual

787
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:09,880
networking identifier which is almost I

788
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:14,828
mean pretty much guaranteed to happen

789
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:17,950
then yes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that ok</font>

790
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:20,920
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok cool not much so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

791
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,200
that on the extensibility thing unless

792
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,930
I'm mistaken but I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

793
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,058
reason to have the header length is not

794
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,700
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the middle boxes it's also so</font>

795
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:33,400
that you can potentially send a packet

796
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,589
with some new stuff in it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

797
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,809
capsule ater can basically d capsulate

798
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:40,359
it and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of silent ignore whatever it</font>

799
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:43,210
didn't understand right which we can't

800
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:47,049
do it with GRE on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the D caps later</font>

801
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:49,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah i mean it can say i know about flag</font>

802
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">one two three and that's all I know</font>

803
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:52,869
about so i can actually parsed out and d

804
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,190
capsulated the fact that the

805
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:57,820
encapsulated

806
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:01,160
encapsulator included oh it's over there

807
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,200
included flag for right the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsulated</font>

808
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,660
can skip that isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the default</font>

809
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,029
behavior here no it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact</font>

810
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,609
opposite if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsule later gets</font>

811
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it doesn't understand it</font>

812
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,600
must drop the packet and the reason for

813
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,610
that is the forward compatibility

814
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,240
problem and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

815
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:23,060
VX<font color="#E5E5E5"> land another instance is a router</font>

816
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,419
alert so if I add something like a

817
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">security field and that's a new field</font>

818
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,860
and I send that to someone who doesn't

819
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,950
understand that field it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no sense</font>

820
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore that you're basically ignoring</font>

821
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:40,460
a security field so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

822
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">extensions we've added I don't I haven't</font>

823
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,540
seen one yet that would make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

824
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,399
ignore their there may be some but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

825
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,259
the most part you know if we had

826
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,760
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checksum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or if we had</font>

827
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,000
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like remote checksum offload</font>

828
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,010
that is supposed to modify the packet to

829
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,480
fix up the checksum we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

830
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,970
ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we certainly couldn't ignore</font>

831
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,270
fragmentation because this is not no

832
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:05,450
longer a packet that can be received by

833
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:07,850
the host so there may be alternatives

834
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,379
and we can take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline but even GRE</font>

835
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,110
had some semblance that some of the

836
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,910
flags had can't be ignored and some can

837
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,340
be i'm not sure how successful that was

838
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,470
in fury yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder whether we want</font>

839
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,270
the flexibility of having some sort of

840
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,600
ignore if you don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but</font>

841
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:26,300
and but we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offline se</font>

842
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,910
because but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would I would really love</font>

843
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,740
if somebody gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good use case there</font>

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,839
are four for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore flight problem I</font>

845
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:36,470
do realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is in some sense</font>

846
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,180
contrary to a lot of precedent GRE was

847
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,640
it was a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in that that have</font>

00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,319
mandatory flags well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you note on that</font>

849
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be great it's some level I mean</font>

850
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm reflecting saying and this is this</font>

851
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,899
reflection but it's sort of the inverse

852
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,610
of today today the middle boxes will

853
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,650
drop everything they don't understand or

854
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,130
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal boxes have that behavior</font>

855
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,240
because they think they know everything

856
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,210
whether we told them to behave that way

857
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,439
or not but but and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the endpoints are</font>

858
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,880
sort of more liberal than what they

859
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,490
accept and this is sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opposite</font>

860
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,000
but ha I don't

861
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:09,740
fine man<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks um so I have a use</font>

862
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,450
case like for this like it's incremental

863
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,700
deployment but let's not talk about it

864
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,230
right like so we need to first figure

865
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,439
out like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to go right</font>

866
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,900
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the status of this at envy or</font>

867
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,550
three so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't see anything in</font>

868
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,760
the tracker that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not auction call</font>

869
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:28,430
or anything so so we are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coffer</font>

870
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,080
working group adoption that's been going

871
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,379
on about a week so we're halfway through

872
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,560
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far all three of the proposals have</font>

873
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:40,010
not had any negative feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

874
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,990
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did mention to Benson so I</font>

875
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,790
suggested this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we have three</font>

876
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,080
drafts what is the appropriate place and

877
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:50,960
he said to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask in the area guys okay um</font>

878
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:58,490
so Brian have you had a chance to take a

879
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this draft okay okay so I think</font>

880
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:06,799
of Eddie Brian yeah so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

881
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,500
it's like what while discussing this in

882
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire email English so let's try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

883
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,130
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discussion going on the mailing</font>

884
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,470
list to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if it like belongs here but</font>

885
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,080
if any or three is willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take up</font>

886
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:20,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work we can just like last call it</font>

887
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,750
here like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over suggesting for the</font>

888
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,880
GRE raft so if there's like another

889
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,950
place where it fits and nowhere else

890
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,450
very fixed right if there's not nor the

891
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,549
working group that wants this other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

892
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,950
your three it makes sense to leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

893
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,859
NV 0 3 and we can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do review here so</font>

894
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,660
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to go forward right okay</font>

895
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:41,569
so i probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to keep them</font>

896
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,830
a separate separate dress because i like

897
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:48,250
the modularity definition right Brian

898
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:55,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haberman as your newly ordained</font>

899
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:57,380
shepherding ad or less than 24 hours so

900
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,000
yeah

901
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,060
there I guess there are two aspect here

902
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,430
that I will make sure we keep in track

903
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,599
the first one is and forgive<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for</font>

904
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">having coming here late because i'm</font>

905
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually chairing the working group</font>

906
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,480
somewhere else the routing area is

907
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,650
hosting a design team to try and figure

908
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,740
out all these data encapsulation

909
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,510
mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

910
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,959
we're we're on board with that one and

911
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:27,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm on that committee good good i don't</font>

912
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't want I don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dairy to go</font>

913
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,990
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> off doing yet another data</font>

914
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,000
encapsulation mechanism and have those

915
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:36,180
guys go what are you doing but as long

916
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you're involved I'm fine men and that</font>

917
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:45,029
let somebody here know what's going on

918
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:47,609
the second thing is is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think at a</font>

919
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,650
minimum you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have people here</font>

920
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,930
review it so if envio<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 wants to adopt</font>

921
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:55,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">all three of them then as things go</font>

922
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,540
forward I would expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a you know</font>

923
00:40:55,349 --> 00:41:01,710
a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dual working group last call</font>

924
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:05,730
in both int area and in MV 0 3 having

925
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:07,830
not seen these three are they I mean

926
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:11,310
I've assumed the second to our envio

927
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:15,509
three specific and the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

928
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:19,200
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the env 01</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the a third one</font>

929
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,930
is actually generic its security for the

930
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,990
encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> date but they all</font>

931
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:27,750
need to go together right or I believe

932
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:30,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">so security is optional however i</font>

933
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,190
believe it's it's kind of court at least

934
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,869
of everything that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking oh let</font>

935
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,650
me channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen Farrell security is</font>

936
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:36,650
never optional down

937
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:45,279
that's fine dear David black wearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

938
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,529
transport area working group hat and

939
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:52,339
trying to make walked up here with the

940
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:54,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explanation sort of where</font>

941
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:56,599
transport is and I think overriding

942
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:59,569
concern is that probably ought to be one

943
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:02,359
focal area for this work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now i</font>

944
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:04,369
guess i<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glued what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought i</font>

945
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:06,650
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> brian say that the routing folks</font>

946
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:10,039
appeared of appear to be leading the

947
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,359
charge there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I've talked Tom</font>

948
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,979
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft a few times I've seen</font>

949
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,709
seen seen em vo<font color="#E5E5E5"> three I think envio</font>

950
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:18,140
three is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to adopt all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

951
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:19,940
these over and transport I think we're

952
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to we're going to care somewhat</font>

953
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:25,459
about the use of UDP but and

954
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,609
particularly have we have the GRE and

955
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:34,489
UDP draft which we're making we're we're

956
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:37,160
making progress on I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

957
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:40,249
is ok to go forward if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got guts</font>

958
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,170
something generic but I'd hate to go see

959
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:43,609
things things getting worked on in

960
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,400
different ways in different areas my

961
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:48,348
sense right now is that is a routing is

962
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,029
in the lead I'm happy happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

963
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:54,859
things stay that way for a while yeah

964
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:56,660
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Eric so yeah so I agree with</font>

965
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:59,269
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we can if</font>

966
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,328
there are other use cases that are not

967
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:05,390
tied to any or three right it might make

968
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:07,729
sense discuss those use cases here<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

969
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:11,359
because you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really discuss them</font>

970
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:12,948
over there right and you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

971
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,749
know if I mean some of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

972
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:17,599
covered but if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

973
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:21,649
additional ones that might be one other

974
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,930
thing is that that would be closer here

975
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:27,440
than in NV<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 3 I don't know what do you</font>

976
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by use cases so what I want if the</font>

977
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,719
fortune cookie option all right

978
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:35,959
something else in the pocket<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not</font>

979
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:39,769
use cases of the protocol but<font color="#CCCCCC"> additions</font>

980
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:41,089
yeah external or overriding uses yes yes

981
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what I'm not yet okay that makes</font>

982
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:46,970
sense so there are a series of drafts so

983
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:48,800
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fragmentation option</font>

984
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,299
is probably of less interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and via</font>

985
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,330
three but seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it'd be more</font>

986
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,450
interesting here and yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

987
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,160
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly if we talk if we're</font>

988
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,899
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about other aspects of</font>

989
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,569
fragmentation here in tunnels right

990
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:07,970
there might be down here click I don't

991
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:09,470
know yeah my inclination is and correct

992
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">me if I'm wrong to start with the basic</font>

993
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:15,890
three and then move to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest yeah</font>

994
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:18,740
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so thank you very much</font>

995
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:21,319
Tom so so what we'll do is we'll take

996
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list and talk to</font>

997
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,940
the envy or three chairs and the routing

998
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:29,720

doesn't want it in tsv for now so let's

1001

1098
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:27,380
wonder which which working to replace<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

is a fit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just to</font>

1100
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,880
provide everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> some background for 64</font>

like doesn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> options for other people</font>

1106
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:48,859
it reviews the options at some point

1107
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:50,959
when people do protocols and so that's

1108
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:52,369
why there's like no natural fit for this

1109

work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are considering</font>

1110
00:50:52,369 --> 00:51:02,509
this in interior so just some background

00:50:55,549 --> 00:51:05,630
so not any comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'll</font>

00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:07,969
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take this up on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and see if</font>

of the shape of the rectangles off in

00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:43,250
the realignment so I decided to come up

1118
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:46,370
come up with a long title so it was

1119
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:49,220
brought to my awareness<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run into</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a subnet prefix but</font>

1136
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:34,690
they're intentionally not uniformly

1137
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,550
forwarding packets at layer 2 right and

1138
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:40,190
we've seen it so typically the way they

1139
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,800
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that hose can talk two routers</font>

1140
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:45,590
and vice versa but<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoes cannot talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1141
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,330
host and we've seen at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1142
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:49,520
examples of this or I've seen two

1143
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:53,120
examples of this there's a split horizon

1144
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,660
case that's used for dsl were basically

1145
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,270
that the host can chat with each other

1146
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:01,970
described in some dsl forum report and

1147
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:04,250
there's private vlans that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy</font>

1148
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:07,250
to sort of conserve on connectivity

1149
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:12,590
address space whatever there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1150
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:14,780
solution but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very little</font>

1151
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,000
little written down how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1152
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,950
stuff in the general case as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1153
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,500
know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of howdy how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configure</font>

1154
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:24,470
things and what works and what doesn't

1155
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:27,230
we have a solution for the specific

1156
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:31,009
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> split-horizon that deals like with</font>

1157
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,900
dad right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't you haven't seen</font>

1158
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:35,300
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says how do you do it do</font>

1159
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">you arpan ND for the general case</font>

1160
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,320
particular how do you do dad for the

1161
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,540
more general case I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1162
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,930
that that that proxy dad thing

1163
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:47,950
necessarily works for the more general

1164
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:53,060
case which is there in private vlans

1165
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:55,220
because a pack at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the v you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1166
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,870
things that are what is it called<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1167
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,430
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called community vlans where</font>

1168
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">some house can talk to each other and</font>

1169
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,180
they conducted the router there's some

1170
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:06,770
other things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat related</font>

1171
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:08,990
which is some filtering in RFC 4562

1172
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:12,620
which isn't really partitioning the

1173
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:14,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">layer to link it's really as saying I'm</font>

1174
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,970
going to play with the ARP table<font color="#CCCCCC"> sends</font>

1175
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:19,280
on filtering to get some isolation

1176
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,230
behavior and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think at least when I</font>

1177
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,850
started thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff that</font>

1178
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:25,340
felt like that was a different thing but

1179
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:30,830
because it's not partitioning things at

1180
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:33,140
layer 2 so that you have any loosely in

1181
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:35,480
part here I'm grateful<font color="#CCCCCC"> two very quick</font>

1182
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:39,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">things one of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you should add</font>

1183
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,600
cable modem to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list ok it behaves</font>

1184
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,310
much in the same way it's glitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eisen</font>

1185
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,710
right it split horizon yeah you

1186
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:50,480
basically each connection to a

1187
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:52,610
subscriber<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a separate channel and so</font>

1188
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,340
the subscribers can't talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other</font>

1189
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:58,760
except through the CMT s so it behaves a

1190
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:01,550
lot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so ed add</font>

1191
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your list the other thing is</font>

1192
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've touched on this kind of thing</font>

1193
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:08,720
a number of times before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention one</font>

1194
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:11,210
duplicate address detection that was

1195
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,629
raised by the broadband forum unisex ops

1196
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:16,850
and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came from another</font>

1197
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:19,780
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really ancient history frame</font>

1198
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:24,560
relay where you have circuits underneath

1199
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:26,680
but it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non broad nvm a non</font>

1200
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:30,529
project has multiple access network and

1201
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:32,990
in ospf we wound up with failure case we

1202
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,760
had to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with point mulund</font>

1203
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:38,240
interface which is essentially a bundle

1204
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,850
of circuits so these are these ones at

1205
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,350
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks today to the attachment</font>

1206
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:45,560
at least to the host it looks like a

1207
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:48,410
broadcast medium yes understood ah but

1208
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,770
so it's related but I yeah it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1209
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,549
different

1210
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:54,860
you can actually see the circuit we're

1211
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:58,720
well on a CMT s or a beer as you can

1212
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,720
tell that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a channel underneath</font>

1213
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:04,310
yeah you if you're actually on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer</font>

1214
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:06,350
ads or the CMT else so at any rate yeah

1215
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:08,720
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some history there you might</font>

1216
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:11,870
want to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at transfer and I'm</font>

1217
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:17,930
inserting<font color="#CCCCCC"> androgenic oh between Stewart</font>

1218
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:21,880
and Dave thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart sure sure I have</font>

1219
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:24,410
a question this also sounds familiar

1220
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:28,850
sounds similar to another case if I'm

1221
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:32,750
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a coffee house with the Wi-Fi</font>

1222
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:34,940
access I can't communicate with the

1223
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,290
person sitting next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

1224
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,540
we're on the same access point would

1225
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:40,940
that be another case profits this model

1226
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:43,430
so it's so there's two pieces there i

1227
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> l2 behavior right i ne</font>

1228
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,750
but then there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate thing that</font>

1229
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:50,630
doesn't mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate</font>

1230
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:53,720
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP because that's is as far as i</font>

1231
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:56,600
can tell sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a ACL policy</font>

1232
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,430
question on the actual router right what

1233
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,290
these technologies do is that they force

1234
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,660
the host to talk through the router and

1235
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:05,090
then on the router you can have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1236
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,190
believe a policy saying oh this hose can

1237
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,870
talk at layer 3 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will run them</font>

1238
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,310
through this far wall and see whether

1239
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:12,529
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk and there might be</font>

1240
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:15,500
deployments where people say now<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts</font>

1241
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">should never talk right so there's two</font>

1242
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:21,080
pieces there that it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> l2 behavior</font>

1243
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:23,270
that that basically fundamentally

1244
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,340
restricts communication and then there's

1245
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,710
potentially l3 policies that further

1246
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:29,300
restrict things but the implications for

1247
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:32,420
things like neighbor discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt</font>

1248
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:35,690
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> are is due to the the l2</font>

1249
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:38,060
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well my two observations</font>

1250
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:40,220
are in many of the cases where this

1251
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:42,890
happens it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people running</font>

1252
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:46,040
the network don't want the communication

1253
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:47,930
to happen maybe for misguided reasons

1254
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:51,020
they don't be blamed for getting a virus

1255
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">on my pc so they want to avoid the</font>

1256
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:58,030
liability my second observation is if

1257
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:01,240
you do want the devices to communicate

1258
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:02,920
that seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Miss configuration</font>

1259
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,990
because at least in my mind that the

1260
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">notion of a subnet the useful property</font>

1261
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,729
of a subnet is everything on the subnet

1262
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:12,250
is reachable by up and everything that

1263
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:14,590
doesn't match when you use the subnet

1264
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:17,800
mask has to go through your default

1265
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:19,600
gateway and if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> treat</font>

1266
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,420
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a series of point-to-point links</font>

1267
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,279
then don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it look like a broadcast</font>

1268
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:29,440
domain if it doesn't behave like that so

1269
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:31,660
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like yeah with a pure</font>

1270
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,950
architectural hat I would agree but the

1271
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,170
part of the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things were</font>

1272
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:40,299
created was to save at least ipv4

1273
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:42,340
address space right so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit of a</font>

1274
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,140
hack but it's out there and we should at

1275
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:46,480

1320
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:49,070
understand thanks Dave favor I would

1321
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,090
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a compare and contrast I</font>

1322
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,220
gather you're talking about what you

1323
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:53,650
would put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a document a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1324
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,629
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about are</font>

1325
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:59,450
similar in some ways to the multi-link

1326
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:03,020
submodel that's used by men<font color="#E5E5E5"> a autocom</font>

1327
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:05,000
6lowpan etc there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> differences</font>

1328
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:07,580
like the word intentionally as opposed

1329
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,130
to you know inherently by physics and

1330
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,140
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are and trying to preclude</font>

1331
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,880
communication between hosts or whether

1332
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,160
you kind of like to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you</font>

1333
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,300
could if you could and so compare and

1334
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,210
contrast because a lot of the same

1335
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,730
issues are there and whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1336
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">address them or not may differ and so I</font>

1337
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,660
would reference the multi-link subnet

1338
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,720
model and the six lo pans style

1339
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:31,730
solutions to that for where you want to

1340
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,930
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested for the issues and ways to</font>

1341
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,730
potentially get around it should you

1342
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:36,080
want to and it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're</font>

1343
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,520
specifically trying to target the case

1344
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,740
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to preclude it rather</font>

1345
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,410
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around it at least precluded l2</font>

1346
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,240
right but yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did look at mobilink you</font>

1347
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:46,190
kinda precluded at layer 2 and get

1348
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,229
around at layer 3 then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

multi-link subnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> pneus and the existing</font>

1350
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:54,260
techniques used by things like 6lowpan

but yes however so<font color="#CCCCCC"> juan carlos zuniga I</font>

01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:05,450
that one there's a group they're called

having Brian Harman was part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

1363
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:27,050
how do we present 802 technologies to

1364
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,000
higher layers because of the issues that

1365
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stewart just mentioned like it's well</font>

1366
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,360
known that some Wi-Fi interfaces you

1367
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,100
know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multicast or</font>

1368
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,720
broadcast domain then then you only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1369
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,700
point-to-point communication because of

1370
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,230
artificial things that will make you get

1371
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,810
to that to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway and this is</font>

1372
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:43,550
especially true for the mobile now with

1373
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:46,730
that we are having this mixed notes of

1374
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:49,190
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 3G or 4G sand and wife ice</font>

1375
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:51,530
and so on so so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to voice</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lower layer point of view okay we don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting if ever we need something</font>

out of fatal to or any coordination or

01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:13,520
any flag or any thing well there's

1385
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:15,890
there's no sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes sir some get some</font>

1386
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,450
sort of digestible document that

1387
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:19,160
describes a bit what they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1388
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,500
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about something they go</font>

1389
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,450
read well in fact the only document that

1390
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,590
it really gets into this specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

1391
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:26,149
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only thing that</font>

1392
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,920
only run does right but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1393
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,470
specific point we had a discussion about

1394
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net x the logical interface that</font>

1395
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:34,430
this an outdated draft that is being

1396
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:37,160
hanging there in the metrics the group

1397
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:39,350
for for a few you next logical interface

1398
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:42,140
and and it was trying to describe how to

1399
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:43,670
how to at the time was for for IP flow

1400
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:47,750
mobility and how we can basically

1401
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:52,250
present the same behavior from a Wi-Fi

1402
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:54,290
and point-to-point PPP 3g interface

1403
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,870
point of view to IP so that r.i.p

1404
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:58,670
wouldn't get confused but but still you

1405
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:00,830
know that we were thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1406
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:03,740
evolving that document into something

1407
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:06,410
more actual and wider than just cellular

1408
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:09,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but we can drop it and do something</font>

1409
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">else if that's it yeah go look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1410
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks thanks a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot folks and thank</font>
