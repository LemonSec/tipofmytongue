we'll check again later we have a fairly

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,430
short meeting today because we asked for

21

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,530

48
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,829
running a webex here so if anyone's

49
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,180
having a hard time seeing the screen it

50
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,460
looks fuzzy to me but it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font>

51
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,800
the angle on that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're</font>

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,730
also putting them on webex mostly

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,350
because we've gotten in the habit of

54
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,850
doing that for interim meetings the

55
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">agenda so we'll take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a minute to take</font>

56
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,410
any feedback on the agenda if anyone has

57
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,060
anything that they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

58
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,010
this is the agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> for today as you can</font>

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of slots missing</font>

60
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,640
like I said we had to present her who

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,230
was unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

62
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,500
freed up about about 30 minutes of

63
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,420
agenda time so in one possibility here

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,340
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a little early which would</font>

65
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,359
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it also</font>

66
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">means we have a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extra time to</font>

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,950
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

68
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,050
if we need to this is the agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,339
today we have like I said another slot

70
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,560
on Wednesday with roughly the same

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,420
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda before I</font>

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,730
move on does anyone have any agenda

73
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:48,380
bashing to do and I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

74
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:50,090
nothing so briefly before we get into

75
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,010
the presentations we have scheduled here

76
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,709
we want to give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick status</font>

77
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,600
discussion and this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the sort</font>

78
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,769
of you know chairs kind of throwing up

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sand slides and then moving on we</font>

80
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,300
actually would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some feedback</font>

81
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,760
on some things so so please pay

82
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,980
attention so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a number of</font>

83
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,540
interim meetings and I think that

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,940
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been productive that it's been</font>

85
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,310
helpful to furthering the conversation

86
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,070
we've had some focus on particular

87
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,100
topics at those meetings which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

88
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been a good idea one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

89
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,710
little difficult is that you know we we

90
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,409
supposed to take minutes and blue sheets

91
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,440
at those meetings just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we do here</font>

92
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,120
and the blue sheets aren't exactly you

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,919
know normal is I mean here there's

94
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,169
literally a clipboard with a blue sheet

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,820
on it so we've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

96
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,770
something in the interim meetings which

97
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,729
is to have an ether pad page where

98
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,490
everyone can go type in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own name</font>

99
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,680
and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's working okay except</font>

100
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we are roughly getting maybe half</font>

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the people actually putting their</font>

102
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:53,789
names on it so I I guess I'm in part

103
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,699
asking for feedback does anyone think

104
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a horrible idea or a good idea</font>

105
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,770
and I see a thumbs up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a good</font>

106
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing good idea so that's good feedback</font>

107
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,210
if someone disagrees please say so i

108
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,949
would encourage people when we have

109
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,419
these interim meetings to please make

110
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:17,789
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you go fill out the blue sheet</font>

111
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:19,378
trays a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic sorry we have one leg hi Tom</font>

112
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,889
Herbert so don't we already have all the

113
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">attendees on the WebEx information</font>

114
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,899
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great question so we</font>

115
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,688
tried we tried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the earlier</font>

116
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,240
interim meetings to take screenshots of

117
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,469
that little attendee list and it was

118
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,089
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> awkward because people kept</font>

119
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:38,279
coming and going<font color="#E5E5E5"> different times in the</font>

120
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,599
meeting so we reconciled like three

121
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,050
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen shots to get the full</font>

122
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:45,270
list of names and some people complained

123
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,639
actually that it's not that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

124
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">way we take names for blue sheets so if</font>

125
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,300
you're in back of the room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

126
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,620
want to fill out the blue sheet

127
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,439
technically you're supposed to fill it

128
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,069
out but we can't force<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to fill it</font>

129
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,990
out so make of that what you will we

130
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,050
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

131
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,759
voluntary process and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice</font>

132
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,110
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could get a report that said at</font>

133
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,409
the end of a webex here's everybody who

134
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">is there of course that assumes that</font>

135
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:15,629
they use real names etc etc so so yeah

136
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,938
we're back we're back to an etherpad

137
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:22,529
approach so yeah so in any case I know

138
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,639
it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a big deal to most of</font>

139
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,110
you because you you show<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at the</font>

140
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,879
meeting and you you participate as you

141
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,259
want but as chairs we have a

142
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that those</font>

143
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:35,029
names get taken so so please do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

144
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:35,029
help us out with that as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

145
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:41,879
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> milestones so we we had a good</font>

146
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,520
discussion about requirements milestones

147
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,620
here and a result of that you'll see

148
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,229
them on the screen in in blue kind of

149
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,620
highlighted in blue the result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

150
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,139
discussion we changed the milestone date

151
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:59,460
to line up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the solutions milestone</font>

152
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,780
dates which are there in green the

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,960
purpose of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really to recognize</font>

154
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we we actually don't care so much</font>

155
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,289
about producing requirements by

156
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,749
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously requirements are</font>

157
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,909
helpful when it comes to producing

158
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:14,099
solutions but we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to produce</font>

159
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:16,438
solutions so by moving them all together

160
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,378
the anticipation is will will produce

161
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,389
them all as rfcs basically at the same

162
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,550
time and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there are some</font>

163
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,289
details around that we might treat some

164
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them differently depending on whether</font>

165
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,060
there are multiple documents versus we

166
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:31,979
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> merge them in one etc there's</font>

167
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,669
another question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the items that are</font>

168
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that sort of dark red the current</font>

169
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,979
milestones for those are due next month

170
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,490
when I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> next month I mean you know in</font>

171
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,930
a handful of weeks so so we have to

172
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,060
decide what we're going to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

173
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,439
I've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide in a minute to to</font>

174
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,500
revisit that topic so we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

175
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,240
more depth there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have time</font>

176
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,379
to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here so I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do</font>

177
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,000
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible so jumping through some</font>

178
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,669
document status and this is where we'll

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,710
touch on those milestones we of course

180
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,919
we have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our SES published we</font>

181
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,948
don't have anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the editors queue</font>

182
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:14,159
and these are the two drafts that I

183
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,539
referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous milestone</font>

184
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,479
slide the architecture in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case</font>

185
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:23,520
draft so so I kind of like some feedback

186
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,539
on this what I'm thinking and Matthew

187
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,180
and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone back and forth on this</font>

188
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:29,669
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize pros and cons to either</font>

189
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,620
approach here but what I'm thinking is

190
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,390
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get these documents to</font>

191
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that we're comfortable with</font>

192
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,890
them like we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be after a last call</font>

193
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,820
now that can either mean that we then

194
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,959
published them as rfcs and continue on

195
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,910
with our work or we can put them in a

196
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,790
mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of a informal state</font>

197
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,410
of being pending solution work so that

198
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,510
we can update them if necessary as

199
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,610
solutions come along now one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

200
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,199
downsides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that second approach is</font>

201
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have something</font>

202
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:01,709
set in you know a stake in the ground

203
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">around which to make decisions about</font>

204
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,399
solutions that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unfortunate on</font>

205
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,080
the other hand it means we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

206
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,470
produce new versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

207
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,290
if they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change later so again</font>

208
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,610
pros and cons on both Matthew and I have

209
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,839
gone back and forth and I think right

210
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,480
now we're sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaning toward</font>

211
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,230
publishing them sooner than later and

212
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">then revising them if necessary but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

213
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,050
kind of you know from our point of view

214
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,440
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arbitrary the point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

215
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,569
get the good work done in solutions so

216
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,950
before I move on to the other document

217
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,020
status I actually like to get feedback

218
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">from everybody here there's one approach</font>

219
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,860
or the other seemed like a good idea of

220
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,569
that idea do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not care at all I mean</font>

221
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,620
the documents are where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and we</font>

222
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:51,390
want to have discussion about them

223
00:09:43,620 --> 00:10:02,490
either way make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the mics on I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

224
00:09:51,390 --> 00:10:05,520
sure yeah we this is wireless mic too so

225
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,150
we'll hold out actually I wonder if any

226
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,829
of these work sure I suggest going with

227
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:15,300
the post method and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into an</font>

228
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:18,740
RFC if we keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement and use</font>

229
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,839
cases in a constant state of flux that

230
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,260
does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> give a solid foundation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

231
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,800
solutions team you'd much rather have a

232
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,960
set number of use cases first that are

233
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined and then make solutions for them</font>

234
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,370
and if new use cases come up have in

235
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:39,470
their order<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have different solutions</font>

236
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,470
address the new use cases

237
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,839
yep so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we maybe just do a show of</font>

238
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,029
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see who's read read these two</font>

239
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafts so for the architecture draft can</font>

240
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,939
you just raise your hand if you've read

241
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:59,699
the latest version<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

242
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:05,459
good and and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the use case is</font>

243
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:12,240
draft as a few few<font color="#CCCCCC"> class</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but still some</font>

244
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:13,859
yeah okay thanks were there other

245
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
comments I think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of people came</font>

246
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,190
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic I don't know if you wanted to</font>

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:25,529
say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if</font>

248
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:27,110
the mics you're working but yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

249
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,670
this is fine if you have a comment and

250
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,149
if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can maybe help me out and see</font>

251
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:41,160
if we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mic working thanks</font>

252
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:44,430
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> osama so we don't have to treat</font>

253
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,550
both of stem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the same way so I</font>

254
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,099
think architecture needs to be out of

255
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,008
seed but I think for use cases it will

256
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:59,360
be beneficial to you know delayed a bit

257
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:59,360
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

258
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:05,260
I think I hello yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I disagree</font>

259
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:11,079
i think i post job that should be a

260
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:14,560
hiatal RFC sooner rather than late Larry

261
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,840
Krieger<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco so I guess I've mixed</font>

262
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,550
feelings on the one hand I feel like

263
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,580
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> architectures been out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there for a</font>

264
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">long time if there were significant</font>

265
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,270
things to change then it should have

266
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,400
come up by now so we might as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

267
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">go ahead an RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it hasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed</font>

268
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,060
now it's unlikely it's going to change

269
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the argument for keeping it open was</font>

270
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:38,859
that solutions when they came would come

271
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,710
up with a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of doing the</font>

272
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,990
architecture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we would say oh we</font>

273
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to now we published it we need to</font>

274
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:51,340
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm leaning</font>

275
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,579
towards if less soon someone comes up

276
00:12:51,340 --> 00:13:00,160
with something big to change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

277
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:02,590
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go ahead and RFC this is an</font>

278
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:09,520
amatory from comcast I think it should

279
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">be RFC I don't see any reason not so</font>

280
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,750
maybe what stirred or to think about is

281
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,310
doing a slightly longer last call than

282
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,900
usual maybe four weeks or something to

283
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,619
give people plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time to review it</font>

284
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,610
in detail and have a good think about

285
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,990
whether they whether they think there's

286
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,820
any solutions are going to come up there

287
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,990
that would contravene it or would need

288
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,990
extensions<font color="#CCCCCC"> straightaway</font>

289
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,349
all right we'll send<font color="#E5E5E5"> him obviously we'll</font>

290
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,540
send a mailing list message on this

291
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,980
topic before we you know do anything to

292
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,689
hear any other feedback that might not

293
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room right now but it sounds</font>

294
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,890
like we're kind of converging around a

295
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,089
way of approaching him here so so we'll

296
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">follow up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing list and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

297
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:54,930
appreciate the feedback continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

298
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,829
the document status we have as I

299
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,979
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before a number of</font>

300
00:13:55,829 --> 00:14:00,000
requirements drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are we are</font>

301
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,339
going to kind of hold back until

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,750
solutions come out they don't literally

303
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> published at the same time</font>

304
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,000
but we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see them progressing with</font>

305
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,980
each other and in some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean that we lack confidence in these</font>

307
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents it actually in my mind has</font>

308
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,949
more to do with how we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up</font>

309
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,959
publishing them because we may actually

310
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,500
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to merge the requirements into the</font>

311
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,689
solutions documents in some cases so so

312
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,870
please treat these as as being you know

313
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,920
key to the work here the decline

314
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:35,070
requirements draft we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need an</font>

315
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,930
editor for so not right now but perhaps

316
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,880
after the meeting or whenever you're

317
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,010
comfortable doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you could let</font>

318
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,930
let us know if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

319
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,170
editing it with we need to pick somebody

320
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:49,920
who who can kind of help you know own it

321
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:55,380
editorially more so than technically to

322
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,810
get it done the the env env a control

323

<font color="#E5E5E5">plane requirements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think are in good</font>

324
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,770
shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now will probably open up</font>

325
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,230
some discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at the</font>

326
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,740
appropriate time there's a presentation

327
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:12,990
today on the what is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled the</font>

328
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,610
hypervisor 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> de draft the name is</font>

329
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,690
perhaps a little too specific but

330
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,459
whatever one question that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to ask</font>

331
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,990
and since there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation on</font>

332
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this later we can actually talk more</font>

333
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:28,320
explicitly about it then but the draft

334
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,140
refers to VDP as a potential protocol

335
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,380
for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution in this space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

336
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,120
in particular so V DP is an i triple e

337
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,970
protocol and in particular there would

338
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,070
be some extensions to it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would come</font>

339
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,690
to let's say to the I Triple E as

340
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,870
requirements from<font color="#CCCCCC"> envio 3</font>

341
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,750
and you might imagine then the envio<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font>

342
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,360
specifies that protocol as the solution

343
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the face so in order for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

344
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,810
there's this kind of limbo that we go

345
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,370
through where we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a liaison to</font>

346
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,959
them telling them that we're interested

347
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work here's the requirements and</font>

348
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,190
that will monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

349
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,110
perhaps doing a consensus call as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

350
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,640
whether that actually solves the problem

351
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and we would kind of iterate</font>

352
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,110
through that appropriately so what we're

353
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,459
thinking is that we would send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a liaison</font>

354
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,390
message to the I Triple E with that

355
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,980
method with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> content and and go from</font>

356
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,720
there but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

357
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone understood that process and if</font>

358
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,490
there's any questions please feel free

359
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:29,609
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask now and it seems fairly</font>

360
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:33,090
straightforward i think the security

361
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements draft is on the agenda I'm</font>

362
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,700
sorry was on the agenda but<font color="#CCCCCC"> our I think</font>

363
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,940
that's one of the presentations that are

364
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,200
our speaker couldn't make it for I

365
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,710
reviewed it very recently and I think

366
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,210
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in very good shape and</font>

367
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,340
frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's not a specific</font>

368
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,590
solution that might be published for

369
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,690
this we it's the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of a</font>

370
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,120
requirements draft that we might decide

371
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,030
to promote to submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the iesg sooner</font>

372
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,050
than the others so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking at it</font>

373
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,399
as being<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly close to done and of</font>

374
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,750
course we'll send a last call to the

375
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,790
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list before we do anything like</font>

376
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,579
that but if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a chance to</font>

377
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,740
review it please do that there might be

378
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,079
one question and there around underlay

379
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,470
overlay relationships with regard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

380
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,899
am so if anybody has when we talk about

381
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,550
the OEM topic on Wednesday if anybody

382
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,920
has thoughts on how the security model

383
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:32,330
applies there it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be valuable to to</font>

384
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:35,550
bring up so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know moving on to the</font>

385
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:38,280
fourth document status slide we are in

386
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:41,730
the midst of a call a pole for adoption

387
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,990
of data planes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vix land gpe goo &</font>

388
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">geneve and so far it seems to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

389
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,070
uncontroversial and everyone seems to

390
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,740
support the adoption of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these so that</font>

391
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,210
that should be a simple process which I

392
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,000
think we wrap up in a week maybe a

393
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,850
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than week</font>

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,450
something like that so please read and

395
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:06,270
have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them there was some good</font>

396
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">work done by the routing end cap design</font>

397
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,840
team I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember if that's the</font>

398
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,809
right title or not if its end cap DT or

399
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,139
dt and cat but in any case that that

400
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,309
draft has very good considerations on

401
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,290
the previous slide when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

402
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data plane requirements we need an</font>

403
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,340
editor for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that document one of the</font>

404
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,040
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like to see happen is is</font>

405
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,360
that they may actually be perfectly in

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,070
line with one another already but I'd

407
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">like someone to evaluate that a little</font>

408
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,409
more carefully and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

409
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,660
data plan requirements for envio<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

410
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:42,300
they're certainly more specific than the

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,220
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> endcap requirements that this</font>

412
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,210
document refers to but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

413
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that they're in sync with each</font>

414
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:52,530
other and then our last document status

415
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,059
slide we have not sent messages the

416

mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these two drafts yet</font>

417
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,440
so I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room an</font>

419
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,460
a multicast framework draft it's been

420
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,730
presented at one or two interim meetings

421
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,820
to interim meetings and the the latest

422
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">version I think it takes in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback</font>

423
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,419
that was received in those meetings

424
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,030
talks about mechanisms for distributing

425
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,790
multicast traffic and then some of the

426
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,440
sort of alcohol and proxy functions that

427
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may need in order to facilitate that</font>

428
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,170
it is somewhat architectural it's not a

429
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,420
solution it's not requirements it's a

430
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,150
discussion about how to achieve this

431
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,770
goal so one of the questions that that

432
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,420
we have as chairs is whether it should

433
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,970
be published<font color="#E5E5E5"> as its own draft or tried</font>

434
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to merge into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the architecture I don't</font>

435
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,990
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong opinion about that I</font>

436
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,860
suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that simply publishing it would</font>

437
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,420
be the most straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> route so so</font>

438
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,149
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like some feedback on that if if</font>

439
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,040
people agree then we would send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a call</font>

440
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,800
for adoption but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to do a</font>

441
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,420
call for adoption and then try to force

442
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,030
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of merger if that was the best</font>

443
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,809
choice in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning does anyone have</font>

444
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,809
feedback on that right now

445
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:17,470
I see some confused looks but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

446
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:21,190
Larry okay since you call that my

447
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,640
confused look the if I recall the second

448
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:29,050
one there the Sarah kya draft is

449
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:31,240
specifically using dhcp to get the

450
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,730
multicast which is not it's a very

451
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,410
solution-oriented right and the first

452
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is more architectural as you</font>

453
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,920
mentioned so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking confused</font>

454
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,439
cuz I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

455
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,380
merging these two documents is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm</font>

456
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,310
sorry I yay you misunderstood and or I

457
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:50,190
misspoke so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was referring to just the</font>

458
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,260
first document the multicast framework

459
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,050
draft and I was referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

460
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,530
possibility of merging its content into

461
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,879
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> envio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three architecture draft ha</font>

462
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,040
that's one possibility the other is that

463
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we adopt it and and publish it alongside</font>

464
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,889
the architecture basically and like I

465
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,060
said I I don't see really a strong

466
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,700
advantage or disadvantage to either

467
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,030
approach except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it might be easier</font>

468
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written to adopt it I haven't</font>

469
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually talked about the second one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

470
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:23,920
on this page<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now i have opinion on</font>

471
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,740
the earlier question you had about

472
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,540
architecture document stay open and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

473
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,370
think it should be closed like all other

474
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,470
working groups in IETF we have

475
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,020
architecture documents we have use case

476
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,150
documents become an ops ii get them move

477
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,879
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i can see this kept</font>

478
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,650
going like now we have a multicast maybe

479
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,710
a year down the road we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

480
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,810
else and this architecture will become

481
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:49,900
really hard to accommodate all those

482
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,730
things it has happening every working

483
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,100
group here we have architecture document

484
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,230
we had different approach to tackle

485
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,850
different problems make each document a

486
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,060
little small easy to read I don't know

487
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,610
about you if I have a 70-page document i

488
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,230
get those up and but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have focused</font>

489
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,340
document people read it understand it

490
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,809
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward yeah i think we hear</font>

491
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:16,209
that concern

492
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:17,710
and share it innokin 1 e della<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

493
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,929
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have much more to add then</font>

494
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,269
Linda but I speak a little closer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

495
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:25,149
sorry um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have much</font>

496
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:28,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">more to admin Linda and it's anup gun</font>

497
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:29,799
money again from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell but yeah just I</font>

498
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:31,330
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reiterate the same thing</font>

499
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,158
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably better to have a</font>

500
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">smaller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focused document and move that</font>

501
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:41,080
ahead on its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks thank you that</font>

502
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,529
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was good feedback the second</font>

503
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,320
document on this page is complicated for

504
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:49,950
a different reason so so this draft

505
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,070
refers to a mechanism based on dhcp

506
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:58,259
around with a nve but specifically a V

507
00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:01,899
tap and VX LAN and ve would use dhcp to

508
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:04,899
to basically be assigned multicast group

509
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:06,789
addresses for the underlay if I if I

510
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,830
understand it correctly based on the VN

511
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:13,299
is a fairly straightforward mechanism at

512
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:15,340
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so I'm no dhcp expert the</font>

513
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,769
so technically it seems like a pretty

514
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,499
simple thing to address to adopt and

515
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:22,090
deal with however it doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

516
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,799
satisfy the whole architecture of<font color="#CCCCCC"> envy</font>

517
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">03 so if we were to adopt it it would</font>

518
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,168
not be in lieu of other control plane

519
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,809
work it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be perhaps as an addition</font>

520
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:35,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that work either as part of a bigger</font>

521
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,519
sweet or just something on the side so

522
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,249
if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it I would actually</font>

523
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:42,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">appreciate that you do because my</font>

524
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:45,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">inclination is to adopt it but since</font>

525
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't have a really clean kind of</font>

526
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,580
fit into the overall work stream that

527
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,049
we've got here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

528
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,509
we understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

529
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,889
beforehand if you have comments on it

530
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:55,450
now I'm happy to take them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise</font>

531
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:59,100
I'd like I said just encourage you to

532
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,100
read it and comment on the list

533
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,150
innokin money from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dell i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

534
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,750
the same thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said at the</font>

535
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,900
interim meeting which is that it really

536
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,580
doesn't fit in with what we're trying to

537
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,980
do here right which is centralized

538
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,418
control plane you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the</font>

539
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that you need from a</font>

540
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:29,650
centralized control brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> soul but then</font>

541
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,450
i but then again if this work were to be

542
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,460
done the question is which working group

543
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,789
because it doesn't fall it doesn't look

544
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">like its dealings in this school and</font>

545
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,150
what you just said is actually the

546
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:43,150
concern that would lead me to think

547
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,250
adoption makes sense because if we don't

548
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,059
adopt it here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear where the</font>

549
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:51,490
work might happen the dhcp DHC working

550
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,639
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps could certainly they have</font>

551
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:57,010
the expertise on the dhcp side of things

552
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,110
so so we there's other maybe there's

553
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,260
another approach I don't know we can

554
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to the 80s as well I agree with</font>

555
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">your point though it would not be in</font>

556
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:11,159
lieu of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the larger work plan we have</font>

557
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:11,158
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

558
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:27,950
betcha<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarika yeah I'm diem but first</font>

559
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,050
author of this draft as mentions that

560
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,360
you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see disrupted when</font>

561
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:35,840
regarding of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HCP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we talked to</font>

562
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:40,040
the DCP chairs and they they really

563
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">reviewed the disrupter and we handled</font>

564
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,110
all their concert at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least we think so</font>

565
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,690
but they don't they don't want this to

566
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">be discussing the HCP unless we adopt us</font>

567
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:56,540
here then then Alaska is<font color="#E5E5E5"> slot in dhcp</font>

568
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,610
presented there then you know that's

569
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing that's how they prefer it this</font>

570
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,199
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of application for them that should</font>

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,130

<font color="#E5E5E5">dhcp thank you that's good so we'll</font>

573
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,750
follow up we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up with the DHC</font>

574
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,950
chairs and the 80s and and so on we'll

575
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,650
figure it out so yeah anyway please do

576
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,090
read it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

577
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,170
straightforward but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm missing</font>

578
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:26,120
something and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can move on</font>

579
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,710
to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> first presentation but maybe</font>

580
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,330
before I do just any last comments on

581
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:36,230
the things we've talked about here and

582
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:42,169
silence<font color="#CCCCCC"> is golden so who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next here</font>

583
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:44,950
Tom and Tom I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little clicker</font>

584
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,950
thing you can use

585
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:12,830
time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he's getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the back</font>

586
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:15,840
I hate that you stay in the box yeah

587
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,669
apparently apparently people on the

588
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,919
video streams were like walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

589
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of frame all the time and so they</font>

590
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:35,360
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these boxes here hello no it's much</font>

591
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:38,490
better hi my name is Tom Herbert and

592
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:44,820
today I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to talk about identifiers</font>

593
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:47,100
locator addressing so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font>

594
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,110
data plane solution for network

595
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,899
virtualization but it is kind of

596
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:55,409
motivated by something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see in</font>

597
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data center which i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

598
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:02,130
task virtualization but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could also</font>

599
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:05,760
be applied to a general vm case which

600
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll talk a little bit about so Tess</font>

601
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,110
virtualization is a concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

602
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,790
a data center running mini tasks for

603
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,060
many jobs basically how data center

604
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,530
works i have an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and what</font>

605
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,929
we really want is the ability to be able

606
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,330
to move task between machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> in kind of</font>

607
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,100
an arbitrary fashion and the networking

608
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,189
component of this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that we can</font>

609
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:33,149
move addresses and network connections

610
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:41,220
with these not not virtual machines but

611
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:43,950
actually task so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we consider kind of</font>

612
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,400
the canonical topology of a data center

613
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,080
it's obviously a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> scaled-down model</font>

614
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,740
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically have our racks with</font>

615
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">host and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> host have a top of racks which</font>

616
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,850
connects to a fabric and we build out

617
00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:01,530
data centers in this model with many

618
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:03,540
racks many switches and what have you so

619
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,210
what we usually have in a large data

620
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,250
center is a job scheduler and the role

621
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,100
of the job scheduler is to schedule<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

622
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,380
different tasks for different jobs so if

623
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,409
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine say company like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

624
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,650
has jobs for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail</font>

625
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,390
Google maths search what have you and

626
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:25,500
what we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do in the data center is</font>

627
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,720
scheduled the<font color="#CCCCCC"> task</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for these jobs in</font>

628
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,120
order to meet the resource requirements

629
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,200
of the jobs so one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would mention</font>

630
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,360
is there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of homogeneous</font>

631
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,690
resources in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical data center we</font>

632
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,800
have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mixes of hardware and</font>

633
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:45,750
networking capabilities so it's often a

634
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,520
problem to scheduler is how do i

635
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,830
schedule optimally to satisfy the

636
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,350
resource requirements of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

637
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,689
scheduling so in this case we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

638
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,310
scheduler and the different colors

639
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,230
represent the different jobs and then

640
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:03,060
within the jobs we can schedule multiple

641
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:05,400
tasks so we get into scheduling dilemmas

642
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,980
pretty quickly and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the case</font>

643
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,350
where we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to schedule across a data</font>

644
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,610
center with very high utilization but

645
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,980
then we have a problem when something

646
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,939
more important comes along more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in print</font>

647
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask what do we do and unfortunately the</font>

648
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,230
current solution kind of is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

649
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to kill existing task and make room for</font>

650
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,300
new ones so in this case the purple guy

651
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:29,159
comes along and we have to zap three

652
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,710
free running tests because it's more

653
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">important that this runs and resource</font>

654
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,060
constraints mean has to run this rack so

655
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,100
this obviously very unpleasant the

656
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,649
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we lose all the</font>

657
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,629
work that those tasks had done typically

658
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,180
we would have to restart those on a

659
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,360
different rack and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pick up the</font>

660
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:51,180
work it does make scheduling a nightmare

661
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,949
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that this de tributed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

662
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,770
schedule has to put a lot of effort into

663
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,500
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optimize on the first pass if</font>

664
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,940
it doesn't do things right and have to

665
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,950
rearrange a lot of work then we lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

666
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,740
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and kind of kill the</font>

667
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,380
utilization in the data center so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

668
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,980
really want is ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do task</font>

669
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:14,040
migration and again this would be under

670
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> auspices of the job scheduler so</font>

671
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,360
would have figure out that the

672
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,370
appropriate place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run these new tasks</font>

673
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,409
are on this rack or in these hosts and

674
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,350
there's existing task but if I could

675
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">just move those to another place where</font>

676
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,490
it's acceptable they run then what I

677
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually get</font>

678
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,280
is a new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new partitioning of the</font>

679
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,590
resources I've been able to satisfy all

680
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,520
the resources or all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> test resources</font>

681
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:46,020
and life<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms forward so that's kind of</font>

682
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:49,470
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal and of course we want this</font>

683
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sort of transparent to everybody</font>

684
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't want applications have to</font>

685
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,690
worry about this we could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

686
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,040
instance ask them to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkpointing</font>

687
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,100
and things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's obviously</font>

688
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:08,059
pretty invasive one important thing

689
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:12,080
though is this is really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

690
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:16,649
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

691
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,809
thank you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero performance impact</font>

692
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:21,150
when not migrating so again this is not

693
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">a new green field where we're bringing</font>

694
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,200
in VMs creating new products this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

695
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually trying to transition the</font>

696
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,720
existing data center how we run these

697
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,370
jobs into this new model<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font>

698
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,940
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding this capability that we can</font>

699
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:37,979
move things around kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> seamlessly</font>

700
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition security and control</font>

701
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,179
these should just be straightforward

702
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,399
continue to work as they they already

703
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,980
are it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention this is</font>

704
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,450
more container<font color="#CCCCCC"> containerization than VMS</font>

705
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:53,790
probably we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly need</font>

706
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,350
overlay networks or virtual switches in

707
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:58,678
this model so that's kind of where we

708
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,959
depart from<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs also we do expect though</font>

709
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,490
that everything that currently works

710
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,030
works in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new model so in particular</font>

711
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:08,730
ecmp the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nic offloads things like that</font>

712
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,260
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work it's also an</font>

713
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,110
interesting characteristic to point out

714
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most task we create probably won't</font>

715
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,540
be migrated anyway the expense of task

716
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,890
migration isn't justin moving the

717
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,750
network address is probably more

718
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,840
expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> than move memory in the</font>

719
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:27,710
storage along with it so we want the

720
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,149
capability but we don't expect to use it

721
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:35,720
too often so we can probably limit that

722
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:40,169
to some extent so the solution in ila

723
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,480
goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IL NP model</font>

724
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:43,230
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can take an ipv6 address split</font>

725
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,770
it in two

726
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:49,890
locator identifier so in this case

727
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,809
though the identifier will be an

728
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:55,230
identifier for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> task so we're in a</font>

729
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:58,220
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64-bit number tight enough and</font>

730
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">NFI task that becomes identifier and</font>

731
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:04,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll have the normal mapping of</font>

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,899
migrates<font color="#E5E5E5"> its locator changes its</font>

734
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,149
identifier stays the same and when not

735
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,799
migrating as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned the data path</font>

736
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,909
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be identical to what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

737
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,190
today so against your performance impact

738
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:23,909
so the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> split like I said this is</font>

739
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:28,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">modeled very similarly to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I LNP locator</font>

740
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:31,740
top 64 bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier bottom 60 64 bits</font>

741
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,690
the locator will identify physical host

742
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:35,638
in the network so all of the switches

743
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,270
and routers will basically be routing on

744
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,950
the top 64 bits and it's routable this

745
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,369
will not be used in a connection

746
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:47,668
endpoint identifier again it's kind of

747
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:51,929
the virtual virtual address for the loot

748
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:54,719
s not routable we can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

749
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:58,710
connection endpoint one thing we did add

750
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,439
that really wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ILP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a type we</font>

751
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,359
use that type to encode virtual network

752
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,150
identifiers and some other information

753
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:10,740
if necessary so we also have the ability

754
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use this with kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the more</font>

755
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,899
canonical virtual network network was

756
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">network fertilization and in this case</font>

757
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can embed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual nut-cracking</font>

758
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifiers into an ipv6 address so in</font>

759
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,030
this model will<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bits in</font>

760
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,310
the identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the virtual network</font>

761
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,410
identifier and then some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bits to</font>

762
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,240
be virtual address so in the case of

763
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,720
ipv4 this works out<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well because</font>

764
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,879
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the full virtual</font>

765
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,189
ipv4 address in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VA door and the</font>

766
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual network identifier we have 24 or</font>

767
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,590
in this case would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 29 bits of virtual</font>

768
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,480
network identifier so this actually

769
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,200
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great solution in a sense it</font>

770
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">would calm place the same thing that</font>

771
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">v excellent and V GRE does but we do run</font>

772
00:35:53,859 --> 00:36:00,240
into problem this is doesn't include any

773
00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:02,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">extensibility so we're using ipv6 as</font>

774
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,189
ipv6 there's no encapsulation which

775
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,180
means we wouldn't have any space for

776
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,010
security for instance so that's kind of

777
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,669
why it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a general purpose solution</font>

778
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:15,369
for network virtualization but it would

779
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,170
also allow us to do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things even in</font>

780
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:20,470
the vm case that we found kind of

781
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:23,050
difficult one thing if you can imagine

782
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:25,569
in a data center we may have a server

783
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:28,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is running as a common service</font>

784
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:31,690
across many different tenants or virtual

785
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,450
networks and we want that connectivity

786
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,130
that server from each virtual network so

787
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,919
i guess the common solution probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

788
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:42,970
to use a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat basically from a vm</font>

789
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,099
not into a servers using a in the vm

790
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:48,220
address space one address and then that

791
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,960
into a public address base in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

792
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,169
it actually might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little simpler</font>

793
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,030
because now we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use a identifier</font>

794
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,550
of the service and actually map that

795
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:00,599
directly so it probably gets us out of

796
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:03,670
using stateful not in that case and

797
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,410
similarly this also could allow us to

798
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,089
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vm than two different virtual</font>

799
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,790
networks to communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

800
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:12,460
so again in those two cases there's no

801
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,980
security as part of encapsulation like

802
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,170
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> get with something like goo but</font>

803
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,390
the advantage is this allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

804
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,569
communicate from within a vm virtual

805
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:29,440
network outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it using a kind of a</font>

806
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:31,420
common address format so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are few</font>

807
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">details to this one is we need the</font>

808
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to locate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our mapping and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

809

<font color="#E5E5E5">presuming this is pretty much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

810
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,410
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> as virtual address to the</font>

811
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,060
physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> address sort of mapping that</font>

812
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,160
the envy of three control plane will

813
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,710
provide some hoping the env3 control

814
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,940
envio three control plane just gives us

815
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:54,670
this answer and we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

816
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,040
represent these addresses in a user

817
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,290
visible fort way so we'll be putting

818
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,170
something in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS for instance that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wind</font>

819
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,970
decay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and identifiers and then we can</font>

820
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,710
connect to that from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user space</font>

821
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,459
and at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point locator will be</font>

822
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,500
attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in order to send it and</font>

823
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:15,400
then one<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting problem actually is</font>

824
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,130
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify errs across a full a</font>

825
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,660
whole large network that are unique for

826
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:25,450
each task and there were a few examples

827
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:28,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this and some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rfcs with this</font>

846
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,580

00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:18,790
assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a / 48 or lower</font>

848
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:22,540
from allocation then we can give each

849
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:25,480
host its own 64-bit address and then the

850
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,920
lower 64 bits are within that host so

851
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,690

854

00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,040
the fabric needs to know the fact that

it goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a physical host should be</font>

10 something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in matching house is</font>

861
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,500
important we have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to allow</font>

862
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:56,349
that obviously we can't take over the

863
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,150
whole data center address allocation

864
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:59,619
because of this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama question I</font>

865
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,540
have what what is the difference with

866
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at least but why do you do they use</font>

867
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:07,480
this so list i believe is encapsulation

868
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,060
so it does look at locator<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier</font>

869
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,710
but adds an encapsulation headed in this

870
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,049
case there's no encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

871
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:17,829
packets on the wire would look like a

IPO tcp / IP UDP over IP they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

873
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:22,239
like the packets that we send today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

874
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,549
in fact that's important because all of

00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,829
the network mechanisms easy MP what have

876

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,099

880
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,140
does kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of entail significant use of</font>

881
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,609
nad as you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we think</font>

882
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:44,379
there's ways to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mitigate the</font>

impacts of that this is Linda so I

884
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,640
didn't hear clearly like if about two

885
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:50,828
holes need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate with each</font>

886
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,940

888
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,160
if I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

889
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,749

890
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,420

891
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:06,218
informed now the address is different so

892
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,190
how do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is no</font>

893
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:13,299
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this address anymore so these</font>

894
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:15,819
identifiers is constant so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when be moves</font>

895
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:18,880
it moves to a different host its locator

896
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:20,769
now changes yes so the locator needs to

897
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,440
go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a so this is where the</font>

mapping distribution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe it's</font>

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,670
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it with the</font>

between<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier to locators and when</font>

902
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,109
that mapping changes then the sender's

903
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be updated okay then so in a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">male 3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is a we suppose there's a</font>

00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:47,920
make those changes the guest OS is still

00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:50,380
a a talking to be they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not seeing</font>

908
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,420
any new so it's this is this all needs

909
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,209
to be would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be transparent to any guest</font>

910
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,920
OS so this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think of it</font>

911
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:59,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">this way at the encapsulation layer</font>

912
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,420
today we would instead of doing an

913
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:03,368
encapsulation where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in the</font>

914
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,739
physical host address in the outer

915
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:09,190
header we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting kind of the</font>

916
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:12,549
physical host address into the packet or

917
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:14,259
the yeah destination address itself so

918
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:19,390
it's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation except without</font>

919
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:22,660
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense this</font>

920
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,459
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know test test this is dino why</font>

921
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,379
don't you just use I LMP<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to make the</font>

922
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,729
changes you want to the ID field and you

923
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,769
could use all those protocols and

924
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,680
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for a while and</font>

925
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:34,459
it's been tested

926
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,589
dile NP yeah so I LNP's they're very

927
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,280
interesting and in fact we're talking

928
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:42,470
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> saleem on it the reason is one the</font>

929
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,780
control plane they kind of have their

930
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,390
own control plane and this is much more

931
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,480
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an env 03 where we want that</font>

932
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">centralized control plane to do</font>

933
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,860
distribution and then the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

934
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:57,740
is so in I<font color="#E5E5E5"> onp you think the mapping</font>

935
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,360
database that<font color="#CCCCCC"> MV 0 3 is going to build</font>

936
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,419
will be more appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your</font>

937
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,250
application than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I OB did yes it's</font>

938
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,210
the say it's the same it's logically the

939
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:10,970
same right it's a mapping of physical or

940
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,890
virtual to physical addresses some hell

941
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:16,339
so I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of the same</font>

942
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:18,379
thing most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ilm p is kind of already</font>

943
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,320
mirror here and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the 64-bit</font>

944
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,810
split which which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

945
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">leverage as much as we can out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

946
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:29,570
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parts where they're using DNS</font>

947
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,570
to convey some of the locator

948
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,620
information probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not as</font>

949
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,330
interesting here I'd rather use the

950
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,830
control the centralized control plane

951
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:42,110
friend via that's why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

952
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:45,560
appropriate and then go 3 for this Bob

953
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Moskowitz hg consulting on so there's no</font>

954
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:53,390
binding between the locator and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I an</font>

955
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
identifier that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no no no</font>

956
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:59,299
binding so you have to have some some

957
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,880
method that I'm now<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font>

958
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,860
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust that I really am over here</font>

959
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is my new address where you</font>

960
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">will find me is there a notification of</font>

961
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:11,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes that's currently talking to</font>

962
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,549
in the move or is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discovery</font>

963
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,920
process which comes in fact that it's

964
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:21,350
moved to new address I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

965
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,440
part of the control plane so<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

966
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:26,540
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the movement and the</font>

967
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,980
point that the scheduling of this is

968
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,810
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by a centralized job</font>

969
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,910
scheduler to begin with so the

970
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:35,450
orchestration can definitely happen from

971
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:38,089
that level<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that</font>

972
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a host has to tell the rest of the</font>

973
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,740
world where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's located or if that</font>

974
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be done by the central control</font>

00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,919
plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think the latter model</font>

976
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,690
actually a little will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little more</font>

977
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,340
secure as you point out do we want to

978
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,200
trust somebody to say where they're at

979
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,180
as opposed to being told by central

980
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,240
authority where they're out i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

981
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:59,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latter is probably a little cleaner</font>

982
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,240
model or because we've seen silly

983
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,680
mobility cases how everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks you</font>

984
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,779
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cue your communication breaks</font>

985
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,190
because it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the dress you</font>

986
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,170
bought it was that that you've been

talking to all this time all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us into</font>

988
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,640
someplace else so now you have to

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:17,509
restart<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sessions because of the</font>

00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on saying</font>

992
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,700
there's isomorphism here with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

993
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,740
need for ila with the envy of control

plane for any other encapsulation

996
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:36,200
want to do live migration where we don't

998
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:42,549
control plane or some mechanism that

999
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:45,890
says or tells descenders<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

1000
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:48,710
locator or the identifier or the virtual

1001
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:51,319

1002
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,840
have moved please<font color="#E5E5E5"> update and then update</font>

1003
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,580
all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your tables and that's the</font>

1004
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,980
documentation of it will find that this

1005
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,779
discussion excuse me and this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

find this discussion in the dot in your

00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:06,520
your documentation on this yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1008
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">sunday vol</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hi diego garcia leone</font>

1009
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,660
watch networks and so one question there

1010
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,300
so the host well the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process</font>

1011
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves would they be filling in a</font>

1012
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,770
random or a well known location that

1013
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,230
that then gets overwritten by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font>

1014
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,150
switch or the redirection process

1015
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:32,410
because I mean as a v6 packet is still

1016
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,900
coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the virtualized process</font>

1017
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:41,029
right so the way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about this is</font>

1018
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:44,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it from the the task we use ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1019
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:47,720
connect so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some sort of ipv6</font>

1020
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:49,190
address that is not doesn't have a

1021
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,950
locator but want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

1022
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:54,200
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some default prefix with an</font>

1023
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:56,720
identifier so that's what we have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

1024
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,419
so a task will get that send a packet

1025
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,669
address

1026
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,430
that and then somewhere at a lower layer

1027
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:05,030
we need to overwrite that kind of

1028
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,500
default prefix with the actual locator

1029
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,630
that turns out to be I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe a</font>

1030
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,609
stateless<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of operation so</font>

1031
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:15,450
for instance we'd have to update the

1032
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:17,040
ipv6 or the UDP and TCP checksum if they

1033
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,140
were present<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in real implementation</font>

1034
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,579
though because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this</font>

1035
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,368
we want to consolidate all that and

1036
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:24,780
hopefully not have to do any rewriting

1037
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,549
of checksums anything like that so we'll

1038
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,490
probably squash that into a single

1039
00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:32,849
operation so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks a lot like a</font>

1040
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:36,450
routing packet routing in a sense so

1041
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:39,690
like I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't like</font>

1042
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:42,328
our resolution where we are writing the

1043
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,799
address as part of sending the package

1044
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:46,980
so somewhere in the data path all that

1045
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:49,440
would be kind of contained but it still

1046
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:54,440
means you're you're still routing /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 s</font>

1047
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:57,119
all over your data centre ville yes and

1048
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,809
Tom and Shirin we're running a little

1049
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,000
hot on time so so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just ask</font>

1050
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:07,799
the question keep going oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

1051
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,890
from context stream so um I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1052
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:13,559
another form of encapsulation really I

1053
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean let's be practical it's completely</font>

1054
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,380
equivalent to VX lan- some dates so I

1055
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,710
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue about the merits of</font>

1056
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:25,319
having goo and VX lon and imagery and a

1057
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:28,619
bunch of others that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point the</font>

1058
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:31,200
problem I see is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

1059
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:34,290
absolute overlay and I see already

1060
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,160
confusion in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market by customers</font>

1061
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:40,170
having data centers in data path and

1062
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,890
thinking that ipv6 solves their problem

1063
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:46,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in fact nothing is sold by this</font>

1064
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:50,540
format you still have to do all the

1065
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:52,140
mapping consistency aging authentication

1066
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,270
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1067
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:57,660
overlay so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear it's very</font>

1068
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:59,880
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is made clear when</font>

1069
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,560
you communicate this idea which is not

1070
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's one more encapsulation</font>

1071
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,880
so I guess encapsulation is abroad

1072
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,990
meeting when I say there's no

1073
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,840
encapsulation I mean there is no

1074
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:15,959
explicit encapsulation heavier than you

1075
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:19,050
mangum ok no other problem is solved so

1076
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:23,410
the fact though it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another solution</font>

1077
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:27,940
so be overhead for this is about the

1078
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:30,069
overheads it's exactly equivalent what

1079
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:33,490
well but the overhead is important to me

1080
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:35,500
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I mentioned we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1081
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">replace an existing data center with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1082
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,480
capability so I don't want to add any

1083
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,759
any of the overhead normally associated

1084
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,310
encapsulation I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to work just</font>

1085
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,440
like they do today so no overlays no

1086
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,840
virtual switches if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in get rid of</font>

1087
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,640
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I just have what looks like the</font>

1088
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,460
same network that I have today only

1089
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,970
adding this new capability<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so that</font>

1090
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:01,090
statement is misleading because when we

1091
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:03,490
discuss overlays ok there is this track

1092
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:05,910
which examines all the various

1093
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,410
encapsulations and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1094
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,819
you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 you want to do it</font>

1095
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,759
in bloom filters you want to do it with

1096
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:16,930
VX not whatever you choose each one has

1097
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:20,470
advantages more beats less bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but</font>

1098
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:22,839
that's only a fraction of the problem of

1099
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:24,750
creating overlay networks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

1100
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is conveying global information</font>

1101
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:30,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the NS just saying the NS is not an</font>

1102
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:34,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer as we know so the discussion must</font>

1103
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:37,990
be a lot clearer about this idea and in

1104
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,580
the context of encapsulations that's

1105
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:47,620
what I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise I already see the</font>

1106
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:50,860
confusion ok Eric not Mike I stays on

1107
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:54,460
the mics are tuned differently so

1108
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:56,710
clarifying question the I'm assuming

1109
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,830
that the host you know the guest VM

1110
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:04,150
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go to a DNS lookup and get</font>

1111
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:05,350
back 128 bits yes Korean cuate you're

1112
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,990
not assuming that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

1113
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:11,529
whatever bits it's using but instead the

1114
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:13,750
actual and the env<font color="#CCCCCC"> evilly rewrite the</font>

1115
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,740
locator asked to host moves and it gets

1116
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:22,280
stuff from the centralized can

1117
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:23,959
open start resumption mm-hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

1118
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,990
there is a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about does that work</font>

1119
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:30,380
with ipsec are the cases when we

1120
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:32,060
basically cover the site we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1121
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,800
pseudo header checksum on those bits

1122
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,440
right and you need to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1123
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,660
because some of the I LNP proposal i

1124
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,520
thought was advocating at some point in

1125
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,850
time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least that you only want to</font>

1126
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,850
check from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower 64 bits etc to make</font>

1127
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:50,810
sure that and only use the lower 64 bits

1128
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:53,868
in the host identification you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

1129
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:57,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP connection identification to</font>

1130
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:59,510
ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you change your source</font>

1131
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,550
address which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is east hundred twenty</font>

1132
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:03,890
eight bits it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> still match the same</font>

1133
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP connection at the other end so that</font>

1134
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,720
that's those employ host changes as far

1135
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:11,960
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> combine two things there so</font>

1136
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,118
ipsec or how the host perceives these

1137
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,369
addresses yes I'm both of them are

1138
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,619
questions and it wasn't clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me what</font>

1139
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you so it's all refer an ipsec there</font>

1140
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:23,600
is certainly a lot of words in the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> LNP</font>

1141
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,060
about that in which i think is useful

1142
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,299
the checksum definitely is something to

1143
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:31,570
consider we have to have the checksum

1144
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,640
work as it does today so on the wire a

1145
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP exum has to cover the same pseudo</font>

1146
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,799
header so we can't change tcp checksum

1147
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,430
which means at the host we have to

1148
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:46,280
rectify the checksum somehow and if that

1149
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:49,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">requires doing a checksum modification</font>

1150
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,080
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could but like i said i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1151
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,669
the end in an implementation actually

1152
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,270
just squash that and somehow figure out

1153
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:59,930
a way to obviate they need to do to any

1154
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:02,090
checksum update if the env is co-located

1155
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:04,339
with a host meaning that's on the same

1156
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,050
server yes but that that was my model

1157
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:09,380
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this is replacing</font>

1158
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:11,060
existing task so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah if you go that</font>

1159
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,310
route then you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

1160
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of check some update if dan and</font>

1161
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:17,540
video is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not co-located but it might be</font>

1162
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yeah did you look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1163
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,810
connection identification I don't

1164
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don piece said that but</font>

1165
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:26,029
I thought they had done the 64-bit

1166
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,049
connection ID as well but I supposed to

1167
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,210
under 18

1168
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:32,120
but then you would have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font>

1169
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosts I i I'll looking at but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1170
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the host</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1171
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,220
as far as I know so what we will be

1172
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:41,300
changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts that's guaranteed but</font>

1173
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:44,569
it sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> house meaning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guest VM whatever</font>

1174
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:46,010
right so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the one</font>

1175
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:47,930
that actually has the connection

1176
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,740
identification<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you know</font>

1177
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,299
what they say might see an

1178
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,910
implementation on that this is do I Eric

1179
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,070
remember GSC<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez gyasi was always</font>

1180
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:57,680
supposed to do the checksum on the lower

1181
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:59,090
64 bits the locator was always<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so</font>

1182
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,919
when you went back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside and the</font>

1183
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,600
other host you return it back to zero so

1184
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,990
the checksums would be equivalent I

1185
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,880
think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a symmetric communication</font>

1186
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:10,250
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are actually running over time so</font>

1187
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:15,110
veena last comment no more people in the

1188
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:17,390
queue veena<font color="#CCCCCC"> our McGann</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco pull the</font>

1189
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:19,550
mic a little closer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sorry Sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1190
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,930
clarifying question you mentioned one of

1191
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:24,230
the differences between this in an

1192
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:29,120
overlay is that you can run a cmp and

1193
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:31,760
other protocols on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upper 64 bits or</font>

1194
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,880
honest on the ipv6 address as it is

1195
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,500
today is there any reason you think in

1196
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of an overlay you can't run</font>

1197
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,710
those protocols like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see MP on the</font>

1198
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:46,220
outer header addresses so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

1199
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:48,890
different I can repeat the last part I'm

1200
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:53,390
so running ecmp<font color="#E5E5E5"> and up another and other</font>

1201
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,490
protocols in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on the</font>

1202
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire ipv6 address in the case of</font>

1203
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,750
overlays it will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer header</font>

1204
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,880
addresses right and but still you can

1205
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:07,190
run run it and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior would be</font>

1206
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:09,050
similar correct so it's ipv6 is the only

1207
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,780
header<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so whatever you can do</font>

1208
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:15,140
with ipv6 in the network should just

1209
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:18,020
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same for outer</font>

1210
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:20,330
headers often overlay solder addresses

1211
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,060
often open for anything overlays the

1212
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:25,250
same applies to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there is ipv6</font>

1213
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,259
if it's an ipv6 overlay you'll have an

1214
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:29,240
ipv6 address and you see em people still

1215
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,160
run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right so that is a plan so</font>

1216
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,990
so we definitely want any in the

1217
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,750
encapsulation case we're using an

1218
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:37,970
additional head or make sure that the

1219
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,770
outer headers actually deal with ECM or

1220
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,500
allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecmp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why for</font>

1221
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance</font>

1222
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:46,410
doing UDP encapsulation the source port

1223
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:48,690
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be set to some sort of entropy</font>

1224
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,399
representing the inner flow so we get

1225
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:53,850
the same effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's still not quite</font>

1226
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,980
the same in in this case the outer

1227
00:55:53,850 --> 00:56:00,509
header is the only header so the actual

1228
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:03,360
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> chapel for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP connection would be</font>

1229
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,880
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of represented by that thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1230
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,230
oh um sorry I've get them to the next

1231
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,760
slides but we'll continue this

1232
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:16,340
discussion on the mailing list thanks

1233
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:16,340
Tom you can give the clicker to Linda<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1234
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:33,240
thank you oh wow solo ok so I'll get

1235
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:36,510
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this is about the</font>

1236
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:40,140

particular draft has been discussed in

1239
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:47,850
the interims to price and we got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1240
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:51,270
comments and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> today I'm not going to</font>

1241
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:53,520
repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we presented an interim so</font>

1242
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:55,740
for the people who didn't come to the

1243
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">interim that would be your loss so maybe</font>

1244
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:02,009
remember next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you have to come to</font>

1245
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:05,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">the interim so in a nutshell so the</font>

1246
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:08,540
distribution we allow to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism when</font>

1247
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:11,640
is the push and another one spool and

1248
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:14,000
since the pool mechanism has been much

1249
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:18,330
mature like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisbeth's using pool and</font>

1250
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:21,840
very much mature the document self focus

1251
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:23,340
a lot on the push especially incremental

00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Porsche right every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time you get one</font>

00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,280
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of comments and so today I'm</font>

we're suggesting using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice ice protocol</font>

1269
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:25,910
simply because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to utilize the</font>

1270
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,550
CSM p mechanism to do the incremental

1271
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:30,859
update the mechanism is already there

1272
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:33,440
and his mature has been deployed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1273
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:37,850
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to piggy back</font>

1274
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:41,300
tre so the new TL maybe piggy back into

1275
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:47,200
is the Round Rock capability tlv we add

1276
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:50,270
a sub TLB to indicate the beans so

1277
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,750
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments coming</font>

1278
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:56,990
up with how do we represent the list of

1279
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:59,210
viens because we can have 24 bits on the

1280
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,799
future actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have 30 bits so the</font>

1281
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:04,340
two bills to represent the ends the

1282
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">number V ends each to be represented can</font>

1283
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,710
be very hard to express so for that

1284
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:14,960
reason we created three different ways

1285
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:17,570
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> nve to express the supported of the</font>

1286
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,990
Vian's what is the millions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> NDEs</font>

1287
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:25,220
participating so one way the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1288
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:28,160
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bitmap say suppose that the</font>

1289
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">ranch of being supported by Tamia is not</font>

1290
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,129
very large and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the starting</font>

1291
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:36,680
VN and the bitmap of the being supported

1292
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:43,010
so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first up govt added to the</font>

1293
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:46,700
routing capability to lv our second one

1294
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:49,820
is supposedly if the network is designed

1295
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:52,460
very well and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> amelie has a very</font>

1296
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:56,030
nice range of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feelings to support so</font>

1297
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:58,420
that's the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is basically</font>

1298
00:59:56,030 --> 01:00:02,620
starting and ending that's the easiest

1299
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,620
bestest up to your way we can support

1300
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:09,319
the third one is suppose if you have

1301
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,990
simple virtual switch based and they e

1302
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:15,050
the number PN's your support is very

1303
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:18,529
limited so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply just express</font>

1304
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:23,030
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of millions so that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

1305
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:26,750
one so with that and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end and</font>

1306
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:29,990
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is we wish this to be</font>

1307
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopted by the working group ok any</font>

1308
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:36,859
questions comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1309
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:41,080
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> descent on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the it list this week</font>

1310
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:41,080
haven't got chance to address them yet I

1311
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:50,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">know good money from Dell I'm not sure</font>

1312
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:53,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">how this is resolved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think this is</font>

1313
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:57,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">one area where open source is stepping</font>

1314
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:59,899
on our open source and standards are

1315
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:03,230
stepping on each other because they're

1316
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:07,250
already is stuff out there and open

1317
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:11,930
source that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use for for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:16,820
much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is it for distributing the</font>

1319
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:20,330
mapping mechanism of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that'd be</font>

1320
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:23,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can look at that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1321
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:27,470
sure everything here is and whatever

1322
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:31,609
they implement can be covered here thank

1323
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:34,310
you so we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some discussion on</font>

1324
01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:36,140
the mailing list about this and and and

1325
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:42,520
we'll chat briefly after the meeting

1326
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:45,890
here thank you tom is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a question or</font>

1327
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:51,340
don't make it more it's on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have</font>

1328
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:54,520
to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good</font>

1329
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:57,470
so i was wondering though so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font>

1330
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,390
tangible proposal do we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1331
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,799
more I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> so can flow would be</font>

1332
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:03,930
interesting but I'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font>

1333
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:10,710
actual draft on how we would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1334
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:14,850
what do you think the plan is here so so

1335
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:18,600
yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more but there</font>

1336
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:20,400
hasn't been yet so I I have some

1337
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,529
questions about how this fits the

1338
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,020
architecture in a centralized model but

1339
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be something that has easily</font>

1340
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:30,900
talked about in a large group maybe

1341
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">email and some white boarding so so I</font>

1342
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,220
don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1343
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:38,070
and that was a requirement that it's a

1344
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:42,209
centralized model to begin with yeah to

1345
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:44,970
be part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them vo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three framework but I</font>

1346
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:49,560
may not understand the full scope of

1347
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:51,839
this either so Eric not mark so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1348
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:54,480
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias can be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1349
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:57,210
distributed implementation as well right

1350
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear whether this is only</font>

1351
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:01,290
doing centralized because some of these

1352
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,120
things I would imagine that in a

1353
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:05,100
centralized model it's actually a

1354
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,880
central controller that sends out

1355
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:11,339
whatever it is here's a bunch of is I as

1356
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">lsas whatever that says oh you should</font>

1357
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,140
have these VN IDs and by the way you

1358
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have these mac addresses whatever</font>

1359
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,950
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> central and I know</font>

1360
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:22,050
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right the way it's</font>

1361
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:24,509
described there it sounds more like just

1362
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:27,180
being capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being distributed when</font>

1363
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:28,980
an NB itself says by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I have</font>

1364
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:32,160
these mac addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1365
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:35,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">part of these VN iid sorry and that's</font>

1366
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:39,440
maybe I'm confused<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the two</font>

1367
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:42,270
things we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> MEA is a sort of</font>

1368
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:45,180
authoritative entity which has the

1369
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:48,750
information how he distributed to the

1370
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:51,480
nae so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the it's only the NBA</font>

1371
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:54,210
originated hello sighs done well in this

1372
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:59,130
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive yes and what you are</font>

1373
01:03:54,210 --> 01:04:00,990
saying that and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can report what</font>

1374
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:04,470
they have that's that's a different

1375
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:08,729
aspect so so so when we say is you bid

1376
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:11,669
it or centralized the two things in a

1377
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:13,380
male 3 we assume there's MAA with the

1378
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">information and here is talking about</font>

1379
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:19,790
how do we distribute granted that you

1380
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:24,109
have multiple and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

1381
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:26,779
one a mea responsible for vm one to ten

1382
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:29,810
thousand another<font color="#E5E5E5"> MV a responsible for</font>

1383
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:33,320
ten thousand one to twenty thousand that

1384
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:35,990
is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so MV as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the image in</font>

1385
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:38,960
the pedestal these<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide to whatever</font>

1386
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:42,229
sells how and E's expressed interest in

1387
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yawns oh because ma II need to tell</font>

1388
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:48,800
the MBA that the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ian he has</font>

1389
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:50,810
he's participating so not if the NBA is

1390
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">garden I was over it no no we're not</font>

1391
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,680
saying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's a guy but I thought</font>

1392
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:56,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the centralized model continues</font>

1393
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,890
how this fits in with architecture I'm

1394
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:59,450
not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's broken I'm just don't</font>

1395
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:02,328
know how it fits in when the central

1396
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:05,000
okay here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so NBA week may</font>

1397
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:08,089
have multiple instance of NBA right meay

1398
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,400
responsible for one to ten thousand m82

1399
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:13,160
for them ten thousand one to twenty

1400
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,839
thousand so that when MBE announced

1401
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:20,899
himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have real 10 so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the MEA</font>

1402
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:23,900
one who were<font color="#CCCCCC"> distribute the content to</font>

1403
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:28,220
this MV the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MEA to would not do anything</font>

1404
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:30,349
so the a median self knows which be and

1405
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:33,290
he's responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when he said</font>

1406
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:36,140
that link state<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell broadcast to</font>

1407
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:39,650
all of the ends all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NBA's he</font>

1408
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:42,770
olivion's I have it triggers specific

1409
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:45,410
MAA to distribute the content to him

1410
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:47,119
yeah for what is worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> eric your your</font>

1411
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:49,670
questions exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm wondering um</font>

1412
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,230
so so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think we should have a</font>

1413
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,760
discussion afterward to make sure we

1414
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:54,020
understand the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

1415
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,730
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more discussion on the list</font>

1416
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:59,089
okay for the sake of time let's just

1417
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:01,040
take one more question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question to</font>

1418
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:03,730
understand the mechanism when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MBE</font>

1419
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:07,460
send a query o to the M de a the

1420
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:09,800
responses sent to all the EEOC only the

1421
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,710
carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the heat and only the query</font>

1422
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:14,869
the requester so you're not using that I

1423
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:18,859
size of flooding mechanism you Jesus

1424
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:22,869
reply yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct so the eyes are always</font>

1425
01:06:18,859 --> 01:06:25,870
a blocking or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> never know so this MBE</font>

1426
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:28,630
is announcing that

1427
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:31,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's participating that is</font>

1428
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:34,000
the broadcast<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1429
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:37,569
whose response who has what information

1430
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,480
so that's the link stage and for query

1431
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:43,060
that's the unicast like when I Duke

1432
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,340
worry I said I know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> by name mea</font>

1433
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:50,259
has the information i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a unicast</font>

1434
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:54,610
message to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular than VA so</font>

1435
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:56,290
typical is always do flood event<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1436
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:59,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm talking about the push mechanism</font>

1437
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,029
using so the this also ties back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1438
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:03,310
question that I have so maybe we should

1439
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk afterward when we can spend a</font>

1440
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:08,110
little more time and maybe draw a

1441
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:14,520
picture here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so thank thank you the</font>

1442
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:14,520
next presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you shall get them</font>

1443
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is early I'm going to give a</font>

1444

01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:40,060
plane protocol and also touch a little

1447
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:48,029
bit on the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> space which is a</font>

1449
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:54,520
this is a current display and

1450
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:57,400
restructure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> split sorry the split</font>

that has a functionality spread across

1453
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:06,400
an end device which is what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

pours the virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an external</font>

running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the external enemy called in</font>

1462
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:34,359
LA and is from network here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

1463
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:36,850
hypervisor to loosely define the thing

1464
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:40,240
running on the end device it can be

1465
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:42,040
possibly a container so the control

1466
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,880
plane protocol is defined by the

1467
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:51,330
framework draft as a intro intro<font color="#CCCCCC"> nae</font>

1468
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:55,180
protocol and this right give a brief

1469
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:58,778
introduction on the state transition of

1470
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:00,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VIP instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or in external MVP so</font>

1471
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:03,339
basically there are two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is</font>

1472
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:06,220
that VN child is connect to a particular

1473
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:10,500
VN in another is to disconnect from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1474
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:14,170
particular VIN in this diagram here

1475
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:16,390
gives the possible state transition for

1476
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">DSI instance I an external and we</font>

1477
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:20,620
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to talk about there</font>

1478
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:24,069
there are two possible States when<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1479
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:25,778
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> another is activated and the</font>

1480
01:09:24,069 --> 01:09:28,549
state transition can be triggered by

1481
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:31,910
various vm event like

1482
01:09:28,549 --> 01:09:35,670
migration of vm creation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown</font>

1483
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:39,269
possibly like the what suspension so

1484
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:43,109
there's a transition pitching pitching

1485
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:47,130
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> states here and next slide</font>

1486
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:50,370
yeah oh sorry the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous slides</font>

1487
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:53,400
are all the wrap-up for the existing

1488
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:56,449
document and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1489
01:09:53,399 --> 01:10:00,509
compare it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the VDP structure</font>

1490
01:09:56,449 --> 01:10:03,449
defined by<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 2001 qpg because</font>

1491
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:05,580
we think if the if we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1492
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:09,030
layered showcase actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VDP is a</font>

1493
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:13,830
is a good candidate to be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1494
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:19,290
scenario so look at the bottom part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture actually this 80 to 120 BG</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">defined the EV be stationary be bridge</font>

1497
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:28,020
which is kind of equivalent to our end

1498
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:30,390
device and external le they define the

1499
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">PTP which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a vs i discovered</font>

1504
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:49,879
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also a draft which is written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by some</font>

1505
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:52,949
experts from who designed this pew bg2

1506
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:55,050
to give a gap analysis between the

1507
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:58,290
current vp and some earlier version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1508
01:10:55,050 --> 01:11:03,390
the requirement document so this this

1509
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:06,000
other come one to one by one analysis

1510
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:08,550
for requirements provided by the

1511
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,530

1512
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:12,870
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details for all of them</font>

1513
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:16,110
actually the like the requirement won

1514
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:18,750
tuesday's it is possible that some

1521
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:42,799
requirements so the right hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> side the</font>

1522
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:46,469
right hand side column accurately

1523
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,969
describes whether the VDP extension is

1524
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:51,750
required we can see some of the

1525
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:53,760
extension can is required and producing

1526
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:56,219
a straightforward and some of them has

1527
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,920
already been supported by current VDP

1528
01:11:56,219 --> 01:12:02,070
like them but number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> V is</font>

1529
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:05,670
indicated by group ID in btp and also

1530
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:09,299
there are some current VDB can stand the

1533
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:18,150
been supported and here the rest of the

1534
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:21,539
requirements are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's it called</font>

1535
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:24,210
talk about it's like yeah the state

1536
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:27,090
transition because we define like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1541
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:43,019
here is something like okay what's up

01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:44,940
missing in the VDP because<font color="#E5E5E5"> VDP original</font>

implementation anyway so here it comes

1553
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:22,289
to the summary of the possible

1554
01:13:19,309 --> 01:13:24,929
intentional extensions we require

specific unicast destination MAC address

1556
01:13:24,929 --> 01:13:30,420
rather than nearest customer bridge

1557
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:34,768
group multicast address and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

1559
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:41,470
another new filter info format type for

1560
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:44,460
the IP address binding and also

01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:08,799
want to clarify it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status in the</font>

this deck of Sir Isaac actually has

01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:17,380
already been discussed in 802 doll one

1572

showed some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre narrating intention to</font>

extend the VDP upon Mao three requests

01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:27,850
so what we are going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we need to</font>

1576
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:31,780
perform another round of draft editing

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hope can stand a liaison from and</font>

1581
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:44,980

01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:52,200
in when the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> tob types i think that's</font>

1584
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,200
a lot last slide right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah it's up</font>

1585
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:59,950
any questions so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll take the</font>

1586
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:02,950
opportunity i know i started a

1587
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:06,610
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list and the the</font>

1588
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:08,260
topic was whether we would and again the

1589
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:12,099
terminology maybe I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting it wrong</font>

1590
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:15,180
maybe it's just confusing or both but

1591
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:18,160
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this extension from the</font>

1592
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:22,360
forgive me the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ve to the tien ve</font>

1593
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:24,220
as as a tagged you know local link

1594
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:29,230
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was an extension of the</font>

1595
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:30,640
vApp or the VN and larry's the latest

1596
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:32,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">email i saw on this was Larry's comment</font>

1597
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,050
that actually the architecture says the

1598
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:37,150
policy is inter VN not in travail and

1599
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:39,220
and so there seems to be a relationship

1600
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:40,960
here and that was I think Larry hit it

1601
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:43,510
on the nose at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least for what I was</font>

1602
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,860
thinking about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be good to</font>

1603
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,230
continue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation on the</font>

1604
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:50,320
mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see whether the</font>

1605
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:52,509
architectures correct in that assumption

1606
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:55,370
and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that we can be</font>

1607
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:58,730
more narrow in<font color="#CCCCCC"> VDP and I'm open to what</font>

1608
01:15:55,370 --> 01:16:00,640
so we're going to do that for because

1609
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:03,169
it's like a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours ago</font>

1610
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,660
discussion so we are going to have more

1611
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:08,480
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bubble I wanted hey I</font>

1612
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:10,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to highlight actually current</font>

1613
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,469
current it out of that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> QB g can</font>

1614
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:15,740
support two modes of operations but

1615
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:17,840
properly is not within VDP protocol is

1616
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:21,290
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something other like a iot p</font>

1617
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,450
extensions we need further investigation

1618
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:27,410
on this issue property is also related

1619
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:29,650
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MV emea controlling controlling</font>

1620
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:35,840
requirements rather than this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1621
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:39,740
yeah we'll do that but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1622
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to clarify so there's some</font>

1623
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:44,840
interest in 802 dot one in doing this if

1624
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:47,179
envio three wants it done there is no

1625
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:51,710
interest in doing it I mean we're not

1626
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:54,320
pushing it but um it seems like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1627
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:57,230
be a good fit and if envio three says

1628
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:00,590
yes this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we want to go then I</font>

1629
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:04,780
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight oh two dot one will will</font>

1630
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:09,050
cooperate with that just thank you yeah

1631
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:11,150
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me say I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the working</font>

1632
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:14,710
group consensus is that we would like

1633
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:16,969
VDP to fulfill this requirement I

1634
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:18,500
haven't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody object to that and</font>

1635
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:21,080
I've heard a number of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirm it</font>

1636
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:24,470
and it makes sense to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so in absence</font>

1637
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:27,650
of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues anyone can think of what I</font>

1638
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:28,790
think we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is have a have a</font>

1639
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:31,040
discussion about consensus on the

1640
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:33,980
mailing list just to confirm that but

1641
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,320
then send a liaison referencing this

1642
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:38,629
draft and saying that eventually we

1643
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,400
would re-evaluate or rather we would

1644
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:43,460
evaluate VDP against those requirements

1645
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,379
when when they let<font color="#CCCCCC"> us know or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1646
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:47,270
like that the details we can work out

1647
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:49,730
but but I think that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process we</font>

1648
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:51,620
would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through here alright so would</font>

1649
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:57,019
that work that that's what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1650
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:59,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then I think once we decide</font>

1651
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:02,330
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go that way or decide we have</font>

1652
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:05,720
consensus to go that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they'll need to</font>

1653
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:07,340
be some refining of exactly what what

1654
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,180
all we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in the filter info</font>

1655
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,500
format

1656
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:13,100
I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know some of what</font>

1657
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:17,690
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in there but but we'll need</font>

1658
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work that out to some extent with</font>

1659
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:23,719
guidance from MV<font color="#E5E5E5"> 03 on exactly what what</font>

1660
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,960
fields in what variations because we've

1661
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:30,320
got right now we have four filter info

1662
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:32,060
formats that we define for layer 24

1663
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:35,690
different situations it doesn't have to

1664
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:41,510
be one format but you know some small

1665
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:44,290
number of variants of what what kind of

1666
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:44,290
information we want

1667
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:53,869
Eric not mark a clarifying question and

1668
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,460
so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking through the gap</font>

1669
01:18:53,869 --> 01:18:58,190
analysis to see whether there were any

1670
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,960
multicast related gaps and I didn't find

1671
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:02,299
the string multicast which could mean

1672
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,710
that everything is fine and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1673
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,329
need to worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about anything but I was a</font>

1674
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:08,000
bit worried when I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font>

1675
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:11,719
passing a unicast mac address well how

1676
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:14,050
does multicast l2 l3 is that just stuff

1677
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:17,389
that works because you're sort of

1678
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:21,139
associating your TS with with

1679
01:19:17,389 --> 01:19:23,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">effectively a VLAN or something right so</font>

1680
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:25,699
some virtual network and multi clusters

1681
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:27,980
works or does there has to be some

1682
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:32,058
special filtering added for multicast as

1683
