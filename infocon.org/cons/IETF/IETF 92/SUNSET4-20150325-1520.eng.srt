pulling the back doors closed as you may

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,120
notice we're down a chair due to the

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,540
intricacies of the new scheduling system

7

00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,899
collaborative note-taking system

32
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:37,630
you got it no the<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool so I will</font>

34
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,859
agenda for today I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect a lot of</font>

35
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,900
bashing because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot that</font>

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,769
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move around we're kind of</font>

recovering this<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group from a</font>

38
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,300
sleep state because we had a couple

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,920
couple of meetings where we didn't have

40
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,290
sunset for meetings and there hasn't

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,579
been a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of activity on the list and</font>

42
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,250
so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're looking at here</font>

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a couple of our drafts that are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be doing a lot of the talking today</font>

57
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,100
about those two drafts and then the

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,150
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of this meeting we really</font>

future work if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's future</font>

63
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,380
work done or take beyond these two

64
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,899
drafts and also sort of gauge interest

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,480
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group do we need to</font>

66
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,120
continue and we have the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

forward progress there so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay if you if you want to</font>

draft

75
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,970
I I can do it this way

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:42,730
Jeff Tom leaves the<font color="#CCCCCC"> o trong virginie so</font>

77
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an author of gap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis</font>

78
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I've been helping for the</font>

79
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,940
netbook the last step of that that

80
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,659
document actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was almost ready to</font>

81
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,210
publish it seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty stable some</font>

82
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">text suggested by Lee Howard was added</font>

83
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,299
in there that was a related to Jeff

84
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,710
George a PVC<font color="#CCCCCC"> support so basically that</font>

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,610
text says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should do a review of</font>

86
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:15,820
the existing IRC and basically figure

87
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:20,080
out figure out if there's anything that

88
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:24,250
would prevent a proper ipv4 sunset in

89
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing specifications so this</font>

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,200
document the gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis is almost</font>

91
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,390
ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> last column unless someone</font>

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,180
suggests that it's not ready or there

93
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:37,090
something missing so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step would</font>

94
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,490
be what has been suggested this may be

95
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,969
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document reviewed by people</font>

96
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,650
who actually do ipv6 only deployment and

97
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,660
getting their feedback if there's

98
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,280
anything any gap in the gap analysis

99
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,610
basically but besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would be</font>

100
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:58,929
would be ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> La Scala any question</font>

101
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:03,550
comment on capitalizes and it's possible

102
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:06,070
last column and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and get</font>

103
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,690
a couple of volunteers to make a good

104
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,340
substantive review of the document we've

105
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,110
had folks do that in the past but I

106
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,900
think that'd be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good step in terms of</font>

107
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,760
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting this back moving again</font>

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,190
so is there folks willing to volunteer

109
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,170
to read and review the document and post

110
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:25,300
post the review to the list and your

111
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:37,100
name for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minutes</font>

112
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:49,400
Luke on in the other volunteer thank you

113
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:52,400
for that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so no</font>

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,390
ipv4 have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> added as a note on this</font>

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,679
one we make several changes so a lot of

116
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:04,159
addition on that side we also focus more

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,130
following Toronto on the no ipv4 option

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,270
for dhcpv6 I think that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

119
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,850
direction that was suggested in Toronto

120
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,370
then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other things of course to</font>

121
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,070
to add looking at the minutes from

122
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:22,580
Toronto I wasn't there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but a few thing I</font>

123
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">could distill from this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion one</font>

124
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,330
of them was that we need more use case

125
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,450
steps basically into ipv4 Sun setting

126
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,460
and how this would be used we don't want

127
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,490
it on and off switch basically something

128
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,530
that would turn off ipv4 all of a sudden

129
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,900
some of the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were made was</font>

130
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,570
that there are still ipv4 devices

131
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,330
activate active in the home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

132
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,700
a nice p does not provide ipv4 anymore

133
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,969
it might be desirable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot of</font>

134
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to keep ipv4 running locally so</font>

135
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,010
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add these options different</font>

136
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:01,400
scenarios and step in the ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun</font>

137
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,169
setting that would be desirable so

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">we--it's mentioned their local</font>

139
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,330
connectivity is one one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question</font>

140
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,430
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that side is do we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep ipv4</font>

141
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,219
link-local for that or do you want the

142
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,490
for example the home rather to continue

143
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,800
giving out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hcp v4 addresses while</font>

144
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:25,970
not having upstream connectivity which

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:28,700
one is the best option also yeah so I

146
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:32,810
think in the last last<font color="#CCCCCC"> x minute we had</font>

147
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">also some basic some some people asked</font>

148
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,520
to have more

149
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,409
details on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timing and the different</font>

150
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,140
steps so we'll try to include that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

151
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,549
the next version of the document as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

152
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,680
there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some questions about</font>

153
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,910
security considerations could this be

154
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,949
used for attacks if you have ideas on

155
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that side that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be willing to hear</font>

156
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,470
them the less we heard a few ones so far

157
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,350
especially on Ras that shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used</font>

158
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,960
to carry the know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> option on</font>

159
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,560
the dhcpv6 side looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this will</font>

160
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:12,820
introduce new vectors for security

161
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:16,239
problems so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to find</font>

162
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,850
some middle ground for for ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> usage</font>

163
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,650
most in the home we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> found any</font>

164
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,520
scenario for the enterprise yet if you

165
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with ideas of our v4 would be</font>

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,020
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used in an enterprise scenario</font>

167
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,400
locally haven't heard any scenario

168
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,340
around that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

169
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,470
possibility yeah there's the manual

170
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,500
configuration of a ride as well if you

171
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,260
what would be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior of a router</font>

172
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,380
home cpe something off the shelf or

173
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,470
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit old that has an option turn</font>

174
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,570
off ipv4 what's the exact behavior that

175
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,290
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> expected in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

176
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,330
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the document as well and</font>

177
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,800
besides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty much pretty</font>

178
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,670
much that actually so basically if you

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,969
have scenarios that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

180
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,219
seen cover in sunset for for either the

181
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,620
home the enterprise or other scenarios

182
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,350
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> click let us know and we'll we'll</font>

183
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:14,380
try to add them to the document so some

184
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,560
of you may remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this document</font>

185
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,439
had a cross review in v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops and there</font>

186
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,290
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of controversy around the</font>

187
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,580
original recommendations and so the the

188
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,310
most recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the draft has</font>

189
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,140
changes that incorporate some of the

190
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,459
responses from that review in terms of

191
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,800
stepping back a little bit from from

192
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,210
having sort of the kill switch that we

193
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">were originally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about here but I</font>

194
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:43,150
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're probably still needs to be</font>

195
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,250
some substantive discussion on the list

196
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,949
about how we do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things</font>

197
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,829
what's acceptable what's not

198
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:52,990
I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear that from folks on the</font>

199
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:56,649
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what the the sense I kind</font>

200
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,089
of got in this is that we had a lot of

201
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,649
strong opinions but not very much

202
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,209
consensus and I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of run</font>

203
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,379
that toward consensus in order to get a

204
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,508
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what it is we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

205
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,910
be doing because then at least we can

206
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,199
say the working group has discussed this

207
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,670
at length and we believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

208
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right way to go and here are reasons</font>

209
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,300
why I don't think we were at that point

210
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,459
when we asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the review in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six in</font>

211
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,899
v6 ops before and that resulted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

212
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,508
discussion that was kind of all over the

213
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:24,220
map it provided us some useful feedback

214
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,439
but I think at this point what we need

215
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,879
is for some folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this and</font>

216
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:29,740
see whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's something they</font>

217
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,819
believe is the right course of action

218
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:36,160
and if not talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they think not</font>

219
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,479
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that we can actually start</font>

220
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,809
having some discussion around how to get

221
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,639
this to a point where we feel confident

222
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the working group it has consensus</font>

223
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,459
behind it then we can kind of push this

224
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,029
forward again for first some additional

225
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:51,128
reviews so along those lines I'm looking

226
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,579
for volunteers to review this<font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font>

227
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:53,579
as well

228
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,899
might look with with care at a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

229
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable labs folks in the audience who</font>

230
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,410
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide some guidance</font>

231
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,410
on use in the home network

232
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:27,239
no volunteers at all okay well we'll ask

233
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to list anything else no the other</font>

234
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:37,590
one is for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so unless there are</font>

235
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,850
other questions or comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,440
two drafts we were discussing when you

237
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,910
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the into the next section</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

238
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion in terms of other things</font>

239
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going on within the working</font>

240
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,650
group there are two other documents that

241
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pending working group adoption right</font>

242
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:59,390
now we had a charter item that covers<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

243
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:03,030
carrier-grade NAT port allocation

244
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,920
originally we had had integrated several

245
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,730
drafts together including one that had

246
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,079
some IPR encumbrance and the last time

247
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,330
that we discussed this the consensus was

248
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to remove that and and have it be a</font>

249
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:18,060
separate document in order to eliminate

250
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,530
any confusion or concern there that

251
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,439
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been peeled off and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is now</font>

252
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:25,400
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual individual submission</font>

253
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:31,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Q and so what's remaining is the other</font>

254
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:34,770
non IPR encumbered CGN port allocation

255
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,210
stuff it looked to me in the previous

256
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,390
discussions like this draft was pretty

257
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:42,920
close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being ready for working group</font>

258
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,080
adoption at this point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

259
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,599
an update from the authors and some

260
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,150
additional comments on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the draft so</font>

261
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,020
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can proceed there that like Ted</font>

262
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,550
lemon probably wearing an ad hat here so

263
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:02,910
what was the process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you used to</font>

264
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:05,219
separate that out well the cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ABS</font>

265
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:08,219
document well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors that that</font>

266
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,350
originally wrote that that section had

267
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,390
had originally their own document that

268
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,370
talked about a specific port allocation

269
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:18,090
method that had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cablelabs IPR</font>

270
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,800
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that entire section of</font>

271
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document was removed and put back as</font>

272
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,010
its own separate document now and so the

273
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,320
document stands alone with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> types</font>

274
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:29,550
of port allocation methods without

275
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,290
requiring that one okay and so I the

276
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,649
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I do see is that the system</font>

277
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,540
still

278
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:35,610
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an IPR file on it and I'm not</font>

279
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure entirely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's why I came</font>

280
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">up to the mind from a machinery</font>

281
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,809
perspective how we do that it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

282
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:41,339
that we've got an email the secretary

283
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:43,459
and say hey this doesn't snow 1 replies

284
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,230
I think the right way to handle this

285
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:50,758
because the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PR works is kind</font>

286
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,999
of a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit arcane what I would</font>

287
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,769
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is actually do a new</font>

288
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:57,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group document or I guess it's</font>

289
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,069
still an individual submission so do an

290
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:02,399
individual submission with a new name

291
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:04,829
and ask the people who submitted the

292
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,600
original IPR to look at the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

293
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:09,300
see if they still want to submit IPR on

294
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,160
it and hopefully the answer will be no

295
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,859
and then you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done because</font>

296
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,769
otherwise just there's no way to just

297
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,360
take IPR off a document and and what you

298
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,769
did sounds like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the right</font>

299
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,720
thing to do but we just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

300
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody agrees it was the</font>

301
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,610
right thing to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't wind up</font>

302
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,769
in a you know because we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart of</font>

303
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,170
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole IPR the way we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PR</font>

304
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,240
is that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF</font>

305
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,550
deciding whether whether you know

306
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,110
deciding what the IPR declaration

307
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,819
applies to which is kind of what's

308
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,189
happening here so that's why I'm

309
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:42,929
proposing this weird transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

310
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking maybe the way we'll do it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

311
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,509
actually have it posted as a working

312
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:47,819
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts as we were close to an</font>

313
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,670
option anyway yep and then once it's

314
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:52,740
once it's posted we could have that

315
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,660
evaluation happen you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

316
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the name sufficiently different</font>

317
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,629
that it doesn't get caught by the

318
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,249
replaced by<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make an</font>

319
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:04,110
explicit decision as chairs as to

320
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:06,689
whether it's replaced by or not and I

321
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,259
think Ted suggestion was change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

322
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:13,620
name first then adopt it so that it's

323
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,179
that such the new one does an individual

324
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,589
summation is replaced by the working

325
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,790
group documents you have the replaced by

326
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,269
history there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that was your</font>

327
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,498
suggestion correct that wasn't my

328
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,689
suggestion but that's prob thats

329
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:31,709
probably even better<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah good</font>

330
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:33,839
guidance thank you and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

331
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:38,579
there's a there's a relatively new

332
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,740
document dealing with ipv6 only<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS it's</font>

333
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,319
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> double-0 draft it needs more reviews</font>

334
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,499
it's fairly limited at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

335
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">this would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor</font>

336
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:48,279
that we would be considering this is not

337
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:50,859
technically a charter item for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us but I</font>

338
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,349
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fits in the right area of</font>

339
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:57,669
discussion in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of talking about how</font>

340
00:16:53,349 --> 00:17:00,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do dns in either an ipv6 only or at</font>

341
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:04,990
ipv6 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus transition technology</font>

342
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:06,759
kind of world but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> these need these</font>

343
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:13,089
need reviews so we can we can make

344
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:14,829
forward progress there the my general

345
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,000
thought in terms of the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

346
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,918
working group is when going<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

347
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,750
we've we've had a number of meetings

348
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,490
where we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had pretty good process and</font>

349
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,199
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress in pretty good</font>

350
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,519
discussion where you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll present</font>

351
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">one or more drafts and people will come</font>

352
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:31,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic and say useful things but</font>

353
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:33,939
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we leave the meeting we get</font>

354
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,700
basically no discussion on the mailing

355
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,080
list at all which leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

356
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,669
that we've got a lot of folks that are

357
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,199
coming in because sunset or looks mildly

358
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,669
interesting but it's not interesting

359
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,720
enough for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sign up on</font>

360
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:48,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list and continue</font>

361
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,480
participating you know in conversations

362
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,518
that I've had with the working group

363
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,259
chairs in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s the sense we kind of</font>

364
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,230
got was that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little too far</font>

365
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:58,119
out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge because ipv6 only is a</font>

366
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,610
pretty new thing for most folks they're

367
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,850
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> operating ipv6 only networks there</font>

368
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,678
any yet they're operating dual stack

369
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,439
networks or they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just now considering</font>

370
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,250
rolling out v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this isn't</font>

371
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,049
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are really</font>

372
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about yet and so people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

373
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,158
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could contribute or whatever</font>

374
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,289
but I think in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 12 to 18 months</font>

375
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,350
since we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> were were thinking about</font>

376
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this there have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been enough ipv6 only</font>

377
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,428
deployments<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this may kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of change</font>

378
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,480
now we're at a point where we can get

379
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:30,940
some renewed interest and so you know

380
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a sense for the room if</font>

381
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,919
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you think is some</font>

382
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,269
of the IETF should continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on</font>

383
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,669
right now you know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a problem</font>

384
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we still need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve if you're</font>

385
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:43,779
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with what what sunset for</font>

386
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:46,649
is intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do feel free to go and</font>

387
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,519
look on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our tools page at the Charter</font>

388
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:51,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">but generally what we're talking about</font>

389
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,710
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is both talking about things that</font>

390
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:56,740
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary in order to turn off</font>

391
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,210
ipv4 in a network given that most of the

392
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,190
protocols the IETF has

393
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,810
design were intended to be very robust

394
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,360
and very resilient a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

395
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:07,090
have off switches per se and so trying

396
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go in and tell them that there is no</font>

397
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:13,000
ipv4 and there never will be there there

398
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:17,110
are some details<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through around</font>

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and also considering when you're</font>

400
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,639
running an ipv6 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> network are there</font>

401
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,280
still problems where features are

402
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,830
missing in the protocols or other things

403
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that don't work properly there's about</font>

404
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the combination of operational</font>

405
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:34,900
considerations and protocol

406
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,580
considerations there and so if this is

407
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,560
something you think is important for the

408
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,179
ITF to be considering it would be useful

409
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:50,020
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to come to the mic and say so or</font>

410
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:53,110
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think so say why Lee Howard</font>

411
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,370
I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important I</font>

412
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,020
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the most</font>

413
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,360
important thing on ETF is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I</font>

414
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,370
think it's premature which is a

415
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,860
delightful thing I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes there</font>

416
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,750
are people deploying ipv6 only networks

417
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,479
and segments of networks they generally

418
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,640
appear as weld gardens right now are

419
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,220
also things that we refer to sometimes

420
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,240
as ipv6 only which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I've</font>

421
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,040
native ipv6 plus something with ipv4

422
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,330
next slide right now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying</font>

423
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">advanced immed i mentioned that that's</font>

424
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,970
there so at worst i would say i'm ok

425
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,770
with going dormant for another meeting

426
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,850
or two if we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then coming</font>

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:39,220
for the field so they favor<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,740
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to directly answer your question</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want a answer part of her and</font>

respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to i guess i agree</font>

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other benefits that this working</font>

435

group has had besides the question of

436
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">how you get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 only well</font>

437
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,129
specifically the gap analysis document

438
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,770
which i think was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous slide</font>

439
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that benefit is that</font>

440
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,520
whenever somebody else comes along to

441
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,669
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to propose this thing and</font>

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">i make it be ipv4 only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then we can</font>

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct them to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

444
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,500
either you're doing the wrong thing or

445
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,010
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that needs to go in</font>

446
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the gap and</font>

447
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,940
document so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we have the gap</font>

448
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,800
analysis document is still open that

449
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,820
serving a function which is is there

450
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,169
anything else that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in there</font>

451
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,879
because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you anybody else is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

452
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> before only then either it's</font>

453
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,730
already covered in that document and

454
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,740
we've got a gap dead in the gap analysis

455
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,600
document as soon as we declare that

456
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,460
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that document then</font>

457
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,500
perhaps going<font color="#E5E5E5"> dormant in the hopes that</font>

458
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,960
well are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we done well we don't know</font>

459
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,180
until the gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop coming right and so</font>

460
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,710
not closing but going dormant I think as

461
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,900
we suggest you is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

462
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,090
thing and not closing because still

463
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,560
provides an avenue to say if somebody

464
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,060
else is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's ipv4</font>

465
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,710
Lenoir brings that proposal into the

466
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,980
IETF then will either come back and say

467
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,690
no you didn't listen or there's a gap

468
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to be added into here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

469
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,600
maybe there's some work there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

470
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,550
least keeping a mailing list open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

471
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,990
collect that sort of stuff and respond

472
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:07,690
to would be beneficial that's my opinion

473
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay Michael Abramson yeah just have to</font>

474
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,580
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is important work I want</font>

475
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to provide or you know how</font>

476
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,620
once someone show up and not have to

477
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,870
give them my TV for a dress and they

478
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,850
then use some kind of translation

479
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,250
mechanism in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network in order to</font>

480
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,050
reach ipv4 space for services I don't

481
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,610
want to I want to be able to get away

482
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">from dual stack as soon as possible</font>

483
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,840
basically this is practically feasible

484
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:35,230
would devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> and operating systems and</font>

485
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">so on so yeah we really need this sounds</font>

486
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">like maybe there's a new volunteer for</font>

487
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,590
the gap analysis review

488
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,230
yeah i mean that's been one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

489
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,100
challenges with<font color="#E5E5E5"> gavin alyses throughout</font>

490
00:22:53,230 --> 00:23:00,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF really is that you're putting a</font>

491
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:03,158
static document out for a gap analysis I

492
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,320
mean in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact a lot of the text that we</font>

493
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">added to the gap analysis draft was</font>

494
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,149
observing that the IETF has done an ipv6

495
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,590
gap analysis in the past and that it's

496
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of sitting and no one really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows</font>

497
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,899
whether the gaps are resolved or not and

498
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,639
that there are about 3,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfcs</font>

499
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:22,360
according to the numbering not in terms

500
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">of actual numbers of our sees that have</font>

501
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,678
never been looked at with this context

502
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:31,059
in mind because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that RC or that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

503
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:33,539
review was done around RFC 3300 and so

504
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:37,658
there's more work to be done there but

505
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:41,379
you know closing<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a review and then</font>

506
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:43,840
statically leaving that way our only

507
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:46,149
real option is to create additional

508
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:56,428
updates for further gaps that are

509
00:23:46,149 --> 00:24:00,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">identified or abyss or whatever okay ah</font>

510
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:07,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Davy so from VI and i'm the author of</font>

511
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:11,469
the sunset for 360 90s I to work is the

512
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:15,389
latest start and because from the very

513
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:20,590
beginning I found the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s is very by ed</font>

514
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:22,719
it's more either more<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to say to move</font>

515
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:25,840
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 owning environment because</font>

516
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,440
the application context is an

517
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,918
independent from the IP layer context so

518
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,919
so I I'd start to want to fund some

519
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,740
problems or some issues related to the

520
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,789
deployment went up basics owning the s

521
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:45,999
in the network actually there are some

522
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:49,809
some transition technologies have the v6

525
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,850
way the reason I come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with to to</font>

526
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:03,080
write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft to</font>

527
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,810
address some issues I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

528
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,699
working on that part but I have a

529
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:13,100
question because she's a overlapping

530
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:18,380
topic one is only six and before one is

531
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:21,159
in the ass so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is it was</font>

532
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed to document that continued the</font>

533
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:31,490
document in this working group or move

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SOP working group just only well</font>

535
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,260
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe you might have a more friendly</font>

536
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:39,860
environment to discuss here then in the

537
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,660
60s up sexually but pressure i read this

538
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,729
and I thought it was actually

539
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:50,240
interesting once we we detail a bit more

540
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the steps in before sun setting i</font>

541
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,350
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last step is actually</font>

542
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,110
not only removing before on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host but</font>

543
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,429
also removing maybe second access to

544
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,050
before which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

545
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,210
discussed i think it was by a camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

546
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,889
something he didn't want that to happen

547
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,350
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be maybe the last step</font>

548
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,170
and dns might be part of the last step

549
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,870
so for example when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a</font>

550
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:14,870
request for record and if you are doing

551
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:18,409
in any requests or<font color="#E5E5E5"> with requests you</font>

552
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,479
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you shouldn't have in the</font>

553
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,430
answer all the v4 information if you

554
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,270
know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance that you don't need it</font>

555
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,700
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought it was an interesting</font>

556
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:29,360
concept so personally I think you should

557
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:33,340
be continuing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss this in sunset</font>

558
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,750
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the other thing is</font>

559
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know we we've talked on and off</font>

560
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,070
within this group and also within DHC as

561
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,030
we've talked when we did that joint

562
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:46,700
meetings with<font color="#E5E5E5"> THC that the presence of</font>

563
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS servers and DHCP servers and other</font>

564
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,450
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have a number of</font>

565
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">different control surfaces where you can</font>

566
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,080
kind of give host information about what

567
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,330
they should use for different address

568
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,679
families because you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font>

569
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:05,000
where you can have v6 only v6 only plus

570
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:08,420
a v4 transition technology dual stack

571
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,830
with native of both addresses dual stack

572
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,269
with CG nv4 only and in a lot of cases

573
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,220
depending on how you're providing those

574
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:19,669
different technologies there may be a

575
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,960
preference for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the either from the from</font>

576
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:23,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the service provider or from the</font>

577
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,460
customer or the hosts or whatever on the

578
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:27,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that needs to know which of</font>

579
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,110
those services they should use for which

580
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:32,240
types of traffic and so there's there's

581
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,350
probably a tie in there as far as dns is

582
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,299
concerned especially if you're thinking

583
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">about dns 64 or whatever and i think</font>

584
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,769
i've provided comments that effect on

585
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,200
the list but that's that's certainly

586
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:50,149
something that fits within our our our

587
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:51,950
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of focus so unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are other</font>

comments on the stuff we've talked about

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,610
so far the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

591
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:01,879
conversation between the the working

sunset for with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighties copied</font>

594
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:13,490
about this idea of ipv4 as a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

595
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,049
can see the premise here and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of</font>

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,429
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is a slot i lifted</font>

597
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,320
from fred baker<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's focused on the</font>

00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:21,559
operational side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because v6 ops</font>

599
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,059
is an operational working group but

600
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,360
there may be more to it than that there

601
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:27,769
may actually be some additional protocol

602
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,418
standardization work or other things

603
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it makes it a better fit here</font>

604
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:36,470
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

605
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,209
think either<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s or otherwise about</font>

606
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,840
where this belongs and whether it's

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,840
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

sentence from each of the charters to

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,000
say why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i asked the question about</font>

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,780
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work was appropriate in v6</font>

613
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,760
ops or in sunset for so the v6 ops

614
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter says that we develop guidelines</font>

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,050
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operation of a shared ipv4 ipv6</font>

616
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,450
internet and provide operational

617
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,600
guidance on how to deploy ipv6 into

618
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:16,260
existing ipv4 only networks the sunset

619
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,480
for charter says talks about the ability

620
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,129
of ipv6 only portions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to</font>

621
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,820
continue to interact connection portions

622
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,190
of the internet that remain ipv4 only so

623
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,110
there's a difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> there between</font>

624
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:30,090
adding v6 to existing v4 networks and

625
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,740
running a v6 only network<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some kind</font>

626
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">of transition technology that that's</font>

627
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,800
what the two charters look like when I

628
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,480
put them next to each other which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

629
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,159
i asked the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's more about</font>

630
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,220
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when i asked it when i asked</font>

631
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,260
look at my ad s I think it's more about

632
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,490
what's the intent then what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

633
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,820
actual words we're not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

634
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:49,320
let's not get stuck in where's where

635
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,090
should the work be done because of what

636
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,889
the words say let's make sure that we

637
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,449
agree with what the working groups want

638
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,740
to do let's follow the consensus of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

639
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,570
working groups and do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that</font>

640
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to be done but let's make sure we</font>

641
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,230
have consensus on that

642
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,030
fab lemon not wearing ad hat but sort of

643
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,090
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of a tea experience</font>

644
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:17,139
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you adopted some of this</font>

645
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:20,110
stuff here might attract more bodies and

646
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might be a good thing so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

647
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:28,209
examples cares don't attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it</font>

648
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,620
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good thing okay you know i</font>

649
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">would i would certainly entertain</font>

650
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,010
suggestions about whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

651
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">additional things to be added to this</font>

652
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,050
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know obviously this is this is</font>

653
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,150
a fairly new discussion and said there

654
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:45,669
may be additional things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fit here</font>

655
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,440
but if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have questions or comments</font>

656
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:52,720
about this we certainly have a few more

657
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,600
minutes to discuss it or independent of

658
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,070
that we have plenty of time for open

659
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,120
discussion if you have other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

660
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think with the group should be</font>

661
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,850
working on or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get up to</font>

662
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mic and say everybody give up and go</font>

663
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:06,899
home or if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a few minutes to</font>

664
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,899
read email and quiet

665
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,779
yes

666
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,590
Michael Lorenzen again so we're to

667
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,449
handle this this is like we had a

668
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,939
discussion before but is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to</font>

669
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,130
include India in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a message that</font>

670
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,230
there is no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> dv4 available on the wire</font>

671
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,990
and there is a big discussion but it is

672
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:39,230
right or wrong or and it's it's a matter

673
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,730
of a taste and opinion I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say you</font>

674
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,039
mean you can be strict about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

675
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:48,710
be pragmatic about it there is no right

676
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:50,750
answer so if this I mean if we if we

677
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doing a TV for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us a service</font>

678
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:58,909
is a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun setting before then I'm</font>

679
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,029
fine with<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this approach and I</font>

680
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:04,549
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a point that this might</font>

681
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:06,320
attract more more people following this

682
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:09,649
working group which yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font>

683
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I think to your point</font>

684
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:15,500
about the the where you do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut off</font>

685
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,480
you know one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

686
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,520
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it some length was the</font>

687
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,020
question of where you're going to have

688
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,700
devices that will actually understand

689
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,590
what you're telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you have a</font>

690
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,140
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside before only it's not</font>

691
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:29,149
likely to have support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for new dhcp be</font>

692
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,659
four options that tell it to stop

693
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:34,399
talking on ipv4 whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

694
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,020
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> in stool stack it's at least</font>

695
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,129
somewhat likely that it might support

696
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:42,230
the options in either dhcpv6 or in ND to

697
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,850
know what to do with options that it

698
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,779
gets to tell it that there isn't before

699
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:50,000
available on on the wire so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that</font>

700
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:53,289
was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wet why it ended up going</font>

701
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,289
that direction ultimately

702
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,560
come on I think the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about v4</font>

703
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,120
as a service is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very critical to what</font>

704
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,090
we're going to do in this working group

705
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,699
because i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the major</font>

706
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,620
constraints to sun setting before are

707
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,650
not going to necessarily technical but

708
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:25,030
you know economic and so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

709
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that without lots of backlash the</font>

710
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:32,050
work on v4 as a service needs to our

712
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:37,270
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have for the group is</font>

713
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:39,010
is does there need to be like a use

different use cases around ipv4 is a

<font color="#E5E5E5">service I mean siit is in some ways its</font>

720
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,000
value in documenting some additional use

721
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,820
cases where either ipv6 only is already

722
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,320
in use<font color="#E5E5E5"> or could potentially be you know</font>

we had talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and no ipv4</font>

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,030
away and things like that if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

730
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,199
feelings on that one way or another

736
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:40,118
could link to a specific use case

737
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,460
because if you do action x here are the

750

question sorry Lee Howard my answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

751
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:26,769
his question is that devices today

752
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,809
decide there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 because they</font>

753
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:31,538
don't have any support for ipv6 they

754
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:34,180
don't know or care or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get an</font>

755
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:36,519
RA so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say there's no v6 I don't</font>

756
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:41,259
think is any equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> in before from</font>

757
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:44,368
lack of Ras yeah well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also have</font>

758
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:46,749

761
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:55,470
to remember that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

763
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,709
blindly without seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> RA but i am not</font>

764
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,269
aware of anyone actually doing that

765
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,220
because I mean that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

766
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:06,129
equivalent that's div for a favorite and

767
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,779
as far as I know there is nothing in the

768
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,420
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that says that that</font>

769
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:12,670
is disallowed it says if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to you</font>

770
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,440
can but nobody does yeah I'd Lee enough

771
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,900
I think windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually does we ran</font>

772
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,339
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> West George wearing my time</font>

773
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,710
warner cable hat we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run into a</font>

774
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:24,369
ran into a bug where we had customers

775
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:28,029
that their windows box was doing dhcp

776
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:30,940
even though it hadn't seen a an RA yeah

777
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:34,989
and it was getting an address because we

778
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,410
support dhcpv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> PD but it wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

779
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right</font>

780
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,250
the default route and so it wouldn't

781
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,399
actually work and when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was playing</font>

782
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,010
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us he discovered that linux and</font>

783
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,930
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrp the number of the others don't</font>

784
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of promiscuous mode and</font>

785
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:51,848
thus it would never start<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DGP</font>

786
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,030
process and would never<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an address</font>

787
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:56,740
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think Mac</font>

788
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,690
does this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's just windows but</font>

789
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,078
that was certainly an interesting

790
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,520
discoveries so it received in IA na and

791
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,289
nothing else it had a slush hundred

792
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,788
twenty-eight on the interface and no

793
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:10,960
router or anything I think it might add

794
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:14,230
a 64 lady<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember just how many this</font>

795
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,720
actually led to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> update of dhcpv6 to</font>

796
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,970
increase the RT son<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max to make it</font>

797
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,500
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or exponential if i remember well</font>

798
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,770
because what they were doing was

799
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,599
actually correct according to dr c so

800
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:32,799
they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA because</font>

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:34,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Lee Howard I think what I just</font>

802
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:37,869
heard is yes such a document would be

803
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:40,510
useful describing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use cases for what</font>

804
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:48,490
happens when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a new</font>

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,098
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece that really is if there are</font>

807
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:54,670
people who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in working on</font>

808
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:55,779
such a thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we of course need</font>

809
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:00,490
authors that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work on a</font>

810
00:37:55,779 --> 00:38:03,039
document like that tificate what the gap

811
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,200
analysis actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about that the</font>

812
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,660
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the document is about that</font>

813
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:14,770
so not sure we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

814
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:16,270

816
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:21,788
that in the case we were just talking

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have infrequent Ras and</font>

818
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,510
therefore you wouldn't necessarily how
