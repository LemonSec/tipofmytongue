will<font color="#E5E5E5"> call seeing it so 11 arrested so in</font>

33
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:59,360
case it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nearly done in national</font>

34
00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:03,138
should win for sure so we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

35
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,900
of any working group items now and a lot

36
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,540
of them seem to be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a last call</font>

37
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,940
and

38
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,150
things that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we want to do today</font>

39
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,310
we will

40
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,679
just trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a sense of how you</font>

41
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,250
should do this son of glass cause we got

42
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:24,470
the five things<font color="#CCCCCC"> cute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up there and I</font>

43
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:31,000
think the natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to do them in</font>

44
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,000
would certainly not sighs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> parallel by</font>

45
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,940
the time it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Next Iron Chef</font>

46
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,690
meeting before the day with last call's

47
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,500
so we have say overlap in the last calls

48
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,600
between one or two documents at a time

49
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,780
but I think the natural way that they

50
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,510
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the evaluation guidelines the</font>

51
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:58,119
ekend benefits probably fq

53
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:08,780
thicken to last calls on each disease

54
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:11,930
have some questions inputs on the last

55
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,429
call process will overload you and you

56
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,300
know at the same time

57
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,740
for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign up to review each one</font>

58
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,650
of these like one or two people for each

59
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,310
document that can commit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to giving us a</font>

60
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,940
good solid last call with you oh he

66
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,460

96
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,560
stuff includes a little bit more

97
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,290
feedback a little bit more scrubbing and

98
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,149
work in my opinion for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last call it</font>

99
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:31,130
but certainly you don't have to wait

100
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:35,350
until last<font color="#E5E5E5"> call to provide comments so</font>

101
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,350
create any of us for pie and cuddle

102
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,220

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,350
ok

104
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:56,960
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is good now you have</font>

105
00:09:51,950 --> 00:10:08,720
your names are occluded and and we will

106
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:10,730
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> against you so I just public</font>

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,760
shaming on the mailing list for not

108
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,130
getting reviews and I guess the good

109
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,740
news is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw if you have all the</font>

110
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,750
documents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last few weeks in</font>

111
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,240
preparation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the media I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

112
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,340
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best sets of documents among</font>

113
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,680
all the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups here they're</font>

114
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,420
quite readable and since we didn't

115
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really invent anything in the working</font>

116
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,650
group it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to review them</font>

117
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,780
because you're you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

118
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,560
descriptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been done</font>

119
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,790
rather than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find holes in new</font>

120
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,329
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing and look for</font>

121
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,329
changes and improvements

122
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:54,260
do I take us to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font>

123
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been talking about adopting was</font>

124
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:01,420
the docsis pie<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafters been sort of way</font>

125
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,310
positive feedback about it on the

126
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,079
narrowest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we think that may be</font>

127
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,880
enough because that's about all the

128
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,290
feedback that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weighing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

129
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,510
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well it's it's useful to</font>

130
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,760
the IETF to describe you know what was

131
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:22,010
done in the docsis spec and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

132
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's implements the PI draft</font>

133
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,620
basically and we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to sort</font>

134
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of move it around in in parallel and I</font>

135
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,190
guess since we haven't seen anyone on

136
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,800
the mailing list tell us that those

137
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,570
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a terrible idea to document and</font>

138
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it has been some positive support unless</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some jumps up here today and tells us</font>

140
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,430
not to do it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

141
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:47,710
adopt that as a working group draft zone

142
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:54,040
your feedback on that before we do it

143
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay pop somebody's afraid to speak up</font>

144
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Richard Richard thinks we should</font>

145
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:04,940
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole process so let's</font>

146
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:11,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to 100 if you think we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

147
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopt this draft she's home now silence</font>

148
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will adopt that and hopefully</font>

149
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,990
we can you ask all that one quickly as

150
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,160
well and add it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the pile of documents</font>

151
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,160
for trying to finish up

152
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:35,839
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our last side right</font>

153
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:35,839
so on to the characterization guidelines

154
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is about an update on the</font>

155
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aiken characterization guidelines draft</font>

156
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:08,710
next we have had some feedback at the

157
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:11,570
ITF in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honolulu and also we've got under</font>

158
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,600
version 0 we've got some feedback and

159
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,270
full review from Alfred then some

160
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,380
comments on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 from Wolfram</font>

161
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:25,579
and then we submitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the version to</font>

162
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:28,490
just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9th march two revisions are</font>

163
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,470
submitted one and two based on this

164
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,530
feedbacks that we've brought in the idea

165
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,650
so they're mainly editorial work and

166
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:40,699
minor fixes but the main thing is that

167
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we provided more clarity in the</font>

168
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,220
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the end-to-end metrics</font>

169
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,230
that are being defined in the draft so

170
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,600
they are right now they come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a</font>

171
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,900
definition what what is good good put

172
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,560
what is loss what is Jeter so and they

173
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,900
they are citing other rfcs and also that

174
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,939
we have more clarity on how to report

175
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,010
the data related to the end-to-end

176
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,790
metric the evaluation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end-to-end</font>

177
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:10,340
metrics also previously the way that the

178
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,630
draft was<font color="#E5E5E5"> written it was like that that</font>

179
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,790
there are there were a lot of mosques

180
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,740
that if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test a confusion you</font>

181
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,959
must do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what we must do that so we</font>

182
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,030
kind of gave a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,440
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> liberally to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the testers to</font>

184
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,870
actually come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their own</font>

185
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:27,040
scenarios and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a guideline</font>

186
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,690
rather than an evaluation sheet and also

187
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,400
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the last</font>

188
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">site if we talked about it was there</font>

189
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quantify different</font>

190
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,950
congestion levels so here we kind of try

191
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come up with a more precise</font>

192
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:44,610
classification of different congestion

193
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:48,400
levels for testing and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is an</font>

194
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:51,490
encouragement in the draft on to try to

195
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,540
gather a cue level metrics the data

196
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:58,000
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cue level metrics</font>

197
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,430
whenever it's possible so so if if you

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
have a hardware that that gives you the

199
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,479
you know the queue size and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

200
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,490
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the hardware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if its impact</font>

201
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,610
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aqm mechanism itself is</font>

202
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,470
negligible then drag the draft

203
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,540
encourages of collecting those data<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

204
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,610
or number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy n marks or whatever's</font>

205
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,540
in the middle boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so whenever whenever</font>

206
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,120
it's possible then it kind of has the

207
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,490
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft it kind of has this mindset of</font>

210
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:35,650
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindset of simulation based</font>

211
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:39,720
things so next so with regards to the

212
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:43,360
metrics and and their data measurements

213
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,240
we defined a set of metrics that needs

214
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,570
that their data needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected so</font>

215
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,100
previously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was the draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was saying</font>

216
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually can choose what</font>

217
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,170
metrics you want to report on so right

218
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,900
now the way it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it</font>

219
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,160
actually says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should actually</font>

220
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,470
report the maximum number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of metrics</font>

221
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can record them and they are</font>

222
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,190
relevant to the context of the

223
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,230
evaluation and to the scenario that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

224
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,600
evaluating so the maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> number is like</font>

225
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,850
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum maximal istic approach but</font>

226
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,740
it's not necessarily all metrics it

227
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:19,240
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of the evaluation</font>

228
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:23,830
and also that the evaluations should be

229
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,170
based on on the end-to-end metrics it's

230
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:29,530
good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> gather the data related to the Q</font>

231
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,990
level metrics but the main the layout<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

232
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,600
the evaluations should be based on the

233
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:39,310
gathering data from the end to end point

234
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of view and also based on the RFC's how</font>

235
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,390
to measure the packet loss in the system

236
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,550
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got two metals on how to</font>

237
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,949
measure the packet loss whether you

238
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,410
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the packet would arrive</font>

239
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,260
within a certain delay bound based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

240
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,630
the RFC 2680 and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

241
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,840
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's lost or based on the</font>

242
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:01,950
RFC 2544 you actually can't all the

243
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">packets sent then you can't all the non</font>

244
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,520
duplicated packets received and then you

245
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,859
measure what was lost then the

246
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,599
definitions of good<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one day one way</font>

247
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,500
delay and jitter they already embedded

248
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:18,219
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text and we came up with</font>

249
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,290
recommendations on how so that does sort

250
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,470
of time intervals if you're going to

251
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">report good food over time how are you</font>

252
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do it different people may</font>

253
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:31,780
measure good<font color="#CCCCCC"> food / different time</font>

254
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,750
intervals so here it provides certain

255
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,090
recommendations for example every

256
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,880
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT you need to report a good</font>

257
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,580
put but then it suggests that you pick a

258
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,480
minimum

259
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,639
an RTT or higher to actually as a

260
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,149
measurement interval for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> delay</font>

261
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,130
samples it's preferable to do it on a

262
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">per packet pair or per packet if you can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a very fine grain</font>

264

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:07,549
10 samples per<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT and all these things</font>

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:14,240
be exactly same for all the evaluations

that that a specific tester is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

then with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network scenarios we in</font>

273
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,970
the previous idea we had this discussion

274
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,240
now we have incorporated that into a

275
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,870
draft that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should investigate both</font>

276
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,029
asymmetric and symmetric link scenarios

277
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,649
where you go the asymmetric link

278
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:44,630
scenarios it should investigate the

279
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:46,840
bi-directional traffic first it looks at

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,700
a scenario when you have the viaduct by

bi-directional traffic when you have an

two instances of a QM on both directions

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:07,280
and then you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also look at the</font>

287
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:11,750
impact as the TCP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act drops by a QM how</font>

288
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,770
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it going to affect the TCPS clocking</font>

289
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,050
mechanism and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> when testing you</font>

290
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,740
should use the maximum buffer size which

291
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">is identical across all the tests so</font>

292
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,970
just to provide some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of coherence</font>

293
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,830
and we've also come up with some form of

294
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,530
recommendation for it for a traffic mix

295
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,439
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changing from a must or</font>

296
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,840
recommendation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as a minimal set of</font>

297
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,430
traffic mix that that one can use but

298
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,129
the test I could come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a more</font>

299
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:48,230
complex set of traffic mixed scenarios a

300
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:52,130
very more critical part of that is to

301
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,170
how to define different condition levels

302
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,810
and rule in the last scientific provided

303

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lincoln and a paper we try to read it</font>

304
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,460
it was highly complex mathematically and

305
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,050
it actually was very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

306
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,020
translate it into something that is

307
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:08,540
quantifiable under every link so we came

308
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,270
up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> so previously it was uses it was</font>

309
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,190
using a certain packet loss ratio

310
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:15,650
assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have had a drop</font>

to certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of congestion we change</font>

313
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:25,010
that into we actually infer that packet

314
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,290
loss into a formula from from a Morris

315

paper scalable TCP congestion control

316
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:32,110
that which actually gives you how many

number of flows on a surfing path would

318
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,040

<font color="#CCCCCC">change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the congestion level anyhow and</font>

325

that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what we want to test is</font>

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:57,139
that is it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to bring down the</font>

330
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,210
what is medium and what is what is heavy

344
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:03,529
you was a bit too heavy the packet loss

345
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:04,908
levels can I suggest using us you've

346
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,590
reduced them to more realistic levels

347
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:08,720
but maybe a slightly wider spread of

348
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:12,168
them would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be with wire like you've got</font>

349
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:17,840
point 1.51 to see maybe going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

350
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:21,919
notice a point Oh 5.1 1.5% or something

351
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,668
like that the kiss if you have the link

352
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is like a 100 millisecond base are</font>

353
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:32,179
two key and 10 mb you know that's very

354
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:35,149
classic scenario and a PDP of offering

355
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:38,119
then you're gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like around 18 19</font>

356
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:40,189
flows for a heavy congestion which which

357
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,629
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually and for a mild</font>

358
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">congestion you would have around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

359
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:46,158
flows and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually compatible to</font>

360
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:52,699
what we have in mind for that is

361
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,080
specific link scenario but with the

362
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,700
previous selling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher</font>

363
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,009
have like 19 flows were actually a mild

364
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,840
condition which would never be a mild

365
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:04,999
condition on a 10mb link you there

366
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,668
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> michigan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT so it will be just</font>

367
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:09,950
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small condition window</font>

368
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:13,399
fluctuations I don't know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

369
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:17,090
pick a number anyways so but yeah and

370
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:18,799
those are it was reasonable but this is

371
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just like a guideline so you</font>

372
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,460
were actually half that test and you

373
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,259
have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests angle if you're</font>

374
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,999
testing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> differently no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loss rates of</font>

375
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:29,529
different number of flows but it's just

376
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:29,529
for wise a guideline of how to do

377
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,180
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> one comment yeah I didn't think</font>

378
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,570
about it I saw you last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night that we</font>

379
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,130
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful that this is the</font>

380
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,460
guidelines and recommendations on

381
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,990
evaluating the algorithms or not on

382
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,440
designing the algorithms right so the

383
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,850
aqm should support ecn I don't know if

384
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,770
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to say that we want</font>

385
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that you know the tests and</font>

386
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:02,629
evaluations of a qm should enable ACN

387
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:05,330
and provide the results yes but I mean

388
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,700
the design i should probably have this

389
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,679
and you know because the play that was

390
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,660
the dominant side support is trying to

391
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,120
go to the RFC every cube right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

392
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">designing algorithms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great was I can</font>

393
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,280
volunteer to read through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see our</font>

394
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,260
and how that and learning capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweak</font>

395
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to separate out the evaluation criteria</font>

396
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,460
from the recommendations to the

397
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:34,360
designers yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it's a big</font>

398
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:38,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal but and bilson sank like um I just</font>

399
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,169
apologize i'm not entirely after<font color="#CCCCCC"> hadn't</font>

400
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,090
reviewed the whole thing i was just

401
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:44,030
looking through it to find out like how

402
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,120
many flows you'd be looking at I know it

403
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,040
like home gateway was mentioned then 17

404
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,320
flows was considered a large number but

405
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,500
you know what about evaluating this like

406
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:59,450
a core router or somewhere where we're

407
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,610
seeing 100,000 flows or is that is their

408
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,090
scope of this is it is targeted to a

409
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:08,899
specific domain that is this whatever

410
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:11,120
flows should be general i think but i

411
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,659
haven't actually sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google a</font>

412
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,629
tutorial 100

413
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">what a generous but it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be but to</font>

414
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:18,840
recommend a general-purpose algorithm

415
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,460
you'd want to see if it works in the

416
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,168
different cases or what the different

417
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,419
parameterization so that wasn't about

418
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,700
algorithms but more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about different</font>

419
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,470
condition levels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what is</font>

420
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,779
the condition level is kind of fuzzy

421
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,149
definition so it could translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into</font>

422
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,679
good things we have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of come up</font>

423
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a way or how to you know produce</font>

424
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:44,249
rather like a fuzzy kind of mild medium

425
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:47,009
and heavy condition levels so I mean I

426
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:48,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how bad this can go away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

427
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean if you have a reference or</font>

428
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:53,070
anything that help we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy to</font>

tester to choose the number of flows

431
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:05,399
that for their case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply these</font>

432
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:07,619
guidelines make a livin<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katims honest</font>

433
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,238
own mind I've just looked on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

434
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,389
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how many of us are</font>

435
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:15,269
using in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this correctly that</font>

436
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:18,299
you define your congestion level as like

437
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:20,399
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount applause would see if you</font>

438
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,349
would be use a prop like you instead in

439
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:24,209
the same scenario basically but that's

440
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:26,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">really confusing for me it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like good</font>

441
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,989
because like for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ms you save it</font>

442
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,139
correctly the congestion error depends

443
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:33,210
on the a community<font color="#CCCCCC"> results</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font>

444
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">is saying it doesn't really go well in</font>

445
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,109
my head so why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just remove it</font>

446
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,840
why don't you just say like we have

447
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:41,279
heavy load we use a large number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

448
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,379
flows and you just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a number</font>

449
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,970
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually it's not that</font>

450
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">important which number we have it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

451
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,759
a large number and then we have a medium

452
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:54,928
number we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a small number yeah so</font>

453
00:26:50,759 --> 00:27:00,150
now really time an example would life to

454
00:26:54,929 --> 00:27:02,280
be you want to test the neck

455
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,620
different ranges of number of flaws yeah

456
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,080
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should say th name over a</font>

457
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,820
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of ranges of flaws and</font>

458
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,230
thats arranged you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply and the</font>

459
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">minimum of tests you should do instead</font>

460
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,400
using two flows pipe flows and underflow

461
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:20,070
so I don't know some of the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

462
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:22,950
sex makes things much easier Michael

463
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:25,230
Abramson so uh I've seen some specs from

464
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,060
typical more powerful wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

465
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,670
to expect or like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> call for a few</font>

466
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:34,940
thousand floats and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> at season so I</font>

467
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:40,860
that puts somewhat of an opera ball I

468
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:43,290
think we at least need to do this is

469
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:49,679
about more like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> axis lost in the</font>

470
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">queue now the ones i'm not sure if you</font>

471
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,790
have everybody's under that any loss yes

472
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,630
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know if our picture of light it's</font>

473
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:59,790
gonna do a lot yes sir so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

474
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">very typical use case for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so longer than</font>

475
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:05,990
one night so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it should be</font>

476
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,990
evaluated

477
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:26,469
she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly my unless the time melrose</font>

478
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:34,450
metrics which actually touches on a lot

479
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:37,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same issues is there space in our</font>

just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's body it's a safari but</font>

482
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,149
because it was actually a lot of overlap

483
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:48,190
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that I've been working</font>

484

group is doing in this specific document

485
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:56,399
yeah i think the IP p.m. stuff is a

486
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:59,738
little more tightly defined this is the

487
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,289
recommendation stop it's not as tight of

488
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:05,649
a specification so maybe we need to add

489
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:08,379
some links to I ppm material from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

495
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:26,440
PMD review because this I don't know if

496
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,999
the script caught this but this

497
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,999
desperately need to be in Europe

498
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I was wondering why I had seen one</font>

499
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:45,139
of those grow up okay yeah so so there's

500
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,540
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think we necessarily need to</font>

501
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">define all of these metrics with the</font>

502
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,520
regular that we've defined for example

503
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">2280</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that would probably for</font>

504
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,470
just these evaluations guidelines that

505
00:29:53,809 --> 00:30:00,770
would probably be a waste of effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

506
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:04,340
think that we need to have sort of wider

507
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:05,629
review of the front outside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aqm room</font>

508
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,639
on the fact that you are sort of

509
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,200
defining new performance metrics and if

510
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">those performance metrics won't be used</font>

511
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,700
not to make operational decisions but

512
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:19,970
instead but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would be another</font>

513
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,980
way of saying we're defining what some

514
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,260
tests and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might look at</font>

515
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:28,490
in trying to come up with performance

516
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,870
metrics would be but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

517
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,700
opinion it'd be I think where crew for

518
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,979
some defining specific metrics in a way

519
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,910
that I peed I Emily impulse at the graph

520
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,650
he actually uses that yeah yeah so the

521
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,650
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss and blossom to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lay stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

522
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,980
is straight to my young but just looking

523
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">at at and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have taken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick look at</font>

524
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,980
the past you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should probably sit</font>

525
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,820
down and finish reading the draft and

526
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:55,400
then come lookin submitter with your

527
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,659
Brian so can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian's name to the list</font>

528
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,660
of review on this one

529
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:19,549
co-manager<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer the</font>

530
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:26,299
conditional admission in this is often

531
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:31,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">the benefit I mean itself as in the</font>

532
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:36,830
Ingraham would be tails I mean just

533
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:40,580
given numbers are hopefully before<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

534
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:42,710
you for any three boot and the buffer

535
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,189
size and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff the thing is that is not</font>

536
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:49,400
independent of the buffer<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the</font>

537
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:53,780
bottle sizes in the formula so dependent

538
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:57,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the actual age yeah it's like there</font>

539
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,549
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you are the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of party</font>

540
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:06,600
so hi I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan Morton and I've got my</font>

541
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:10,669
benchmarking methodology co-chairs had

542
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,840
on at the moment I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to</font>

543
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,360
stimulate some review from the other

544
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,610
benchmarking with folks by sharing my

545
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,889
review with them and so far it hasn't

546
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,919
been successful but there's a I would

547
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,810
say there's as much overlap between this

548
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,450
work and I ppm is there is with

549
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:30,149
benchmarking methodology so maybe we can

550
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:33,630
try one more time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks from</font>

551
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:35,100
BMW G to this as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there to</font>

552
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,020
comment I would make it which is on the

553
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,709
previous slide if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wouldn't mind just</font>

554
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:45,600
put them back their West<font color="#CCCCCC"> Briton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

555
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:48,720
you yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic mix so at least for</font>

556
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the for the UDP stateless stuff we have</font>

557
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,930
an RF seeing the number escapes me but

558
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:58,860
it's the i mix genome which can help

559
00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:01,080
here this this provides repeatability if

560
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,729
you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> different mixes we think it's at</font>

561
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,580
least it's our best shot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful</font>

562
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,960
but but the answer is when you test when

563
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">you test with more than one packet size</font>

564
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,610
repeatability between test labs it's a

565
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">little goes it goes overrides just</font>

566
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,149
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font>

567
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:24,989
me again and I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain</font>

568
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,218
further what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant sir first of all</font>

569
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:28,739
what I like about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document it</font>

570
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:30,329
that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear and very focused and I</font>

571
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:33,089
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really useful for people who</font>

572
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:34,379
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something so I also regarding</font>

573
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:35,639
to the IP p.m. stuff it should be in

574
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,688
line with<font color="#CCCCCC"> IVA p.m.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it shouldn't make</font>

575
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,079
this couple this document more

576
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:42,179
complicated it should stay as it is so

577
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,709
that's that's a nice period and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

578
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:48,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">was also why I made this proposal</font>

579
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:50,689
because the congestion level is the term

580
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:53,369
itself is very confusing to me because

581
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:55,319
you calculated based on drop ship and

582
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:57,238
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we applied the menu you get a</font>

583
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,219
number of flows you apply this number

584
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:01,109
flows using a different ATM and get a

585
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:02,279
different loss right out of it which

586
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:04,049
other people will again see as a

587
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:06,779
congestion lever and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

588
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:10,109
just makes I understand what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but</font>

589
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,089
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's a weird term to me and</font>

590
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:16,078
I also don't think that is needed so of

591
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:18,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">course i'm using over different vendors</font>

592
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,919
today products using the same number of

593
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:21,210
flows relieved to what you call

594
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,609
different projections efforts because

595
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,649
all the thing it doesn't matter to have

596
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:27,779
always the same tradition ever it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

597
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you just test a small number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laws</font>

598
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:31,049
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be remember flows and a maximum Bo</font>

599
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:33,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">feels so the idea behind this was that</font>

600
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:36,399
if you've got tester a antecessor be

601
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,139
testing two different accurate and using

602
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,000
number of clothes and different links

603
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,889
then we wanted to actually be using the

604
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,989
same number of floors you put the grabs

605
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,960
in front of each other and start

606
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:49,000
comparing so that's why I was certain

607
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,059
you know net for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start a netbook</font>

608
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,949
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> had characteristics so so</font>

609
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:55,629
basically what we saw like if you have

610
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:57,098
to have a scenario you have the a

611
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,618
certain dinnae you have a sudden bang

612
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:03,339
castrate you have placed a jumbo certain

613
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:07,539
records so you have 100 milliseconds and

614
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:09,130
to end today 10m bit link and then you

615
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:12,760
calculate<font color="#E5E5E5"> your numbers of floats and</font>

616
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:14,349
that's in this case 10 now you take the

617
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,359
same and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different scenario you</font>

618
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:17,859
have a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth so the number</font>

619
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:19,900
you broke i could a<font color="#E5E5E5"> disguising but like</font>

620
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:22,509
half half the bandwidth so it's five

621
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:26,650
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 yes what is important is</font>

622
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you compare the algorithms in these</font>

623
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,579
scenarios like you have 10 megabits per

624
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,230
second half your 10 mega a second

625
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:34,599
hundred meetings and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 flows and then</font>

626
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,130
you can play all the apms and then the

627
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,140
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario it doesn't actually matter</font>

628
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,490
if you have five<font color="#CCCCCC"> or ten flows but you</font>

629
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,618
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same number of flows</font>

630
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,160
and that's why I just say pick a number

631
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:46,599
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all sinners just</font>

632
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely number flows on a certain</font>

633
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,470
links would translate to something

634
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,419
condition levels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like why</font>

635
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,879
is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the same condition</font>

636
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,859
if it's just like you live in the medium

637
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,690
congestion if it's not a perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

638
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,670
exactly the same position but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

639
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,589
wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> mild that's the point is</font>

640
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,230
that certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of flows maybe mind</font>

641
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm certain link but not mild and</font>

642
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,720
another is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font>

643
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,000
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the formula that gives you that</font>

644
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">number actually want and the end is to</font>

645
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover in the use cases so if you even so</font>

646
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,470
you have a large link and you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

647
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,090
two flows for like or you have that

648
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,430
Smalling and you have hundred flows and

649
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,380
that's very heavy congestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

650
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,149
review q's case if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really can have a</font>

651
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,280
link where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it flows then</font>

652
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,540
you should test it I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

653
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,940
the congestion never because the

654
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,370
congestion<font color="#E5E5E5"> has influenced by the ATM I</font>

655
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,720
care about the scenario yet and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

656
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear what they could do actually we</font>

657
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">could keep the formula but just scrap</font>

658
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:45,760
the congestion level definitions but

659
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:47,380
keeping the formula<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one thing i</font>

660
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,150
find the term are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing but i</font>

661
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,980
was done i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's more complicated</font>

662
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:57,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to be just have to pick</font>

663
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:58,690
numbers I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and you'll</font>

664
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree again I don't care about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

665
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,130
of it but something of that sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

666
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,020
which takes some of the dimensions out

667
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,620
of the problem so if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

668
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,930
comparable is is quite important because

669
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,359
say I've got a scenario with the

670
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:17,379
bandwidth is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten terabits a second and</font>

671
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:21,160
the rtt is<font color="#E5E5E5"> four milliseconds and I want</font>

672
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to forget figure out whether an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IQ in</font>

673
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,240
that worked in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation somewhat</font>

674
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:30,009
comparable to another situation where we

675
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:34,240
hit say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 100 gigs and then a</font>

676
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:36,010
minoral a second 30 tea right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

677
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,359
actually make it at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

678
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,610
comparison based on what happened with

679
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this condition label my metric because</font>

680
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:44,370
it's a relative measurement within the

681
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:47,080
within the new apprentice of a scenario

682
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,549
but the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flows you require for</font>

683
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,700
those two scenarios is radically

684
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:54,280
different right yeah for the team taylor

685
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,839
scenario i mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I know so seven</font>

686
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,220
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> employers is kind of going to be</font>

687
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something that's going to be</font>

688
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,370
required<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the context right</font>

689
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,570
don't you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

690
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,279
number

691
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,830
to be able to actually come up with it

692
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,480
on a teen turbit link of course you do

693
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:12,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes oh that's right that's what I'm</font>

694
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:14,020
saying when I was whether at a serious

695
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,420
problem is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the large</font>

696
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:20,080
dimensionality space you are simplified

697
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,630
and I will suggest that being one of the

698
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,810
primers you have a pic is the na- for

699
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:29,680
shear rate that is the aggregate

700
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:32,920
bandwidth divided by the number of rows

701
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess with these ways said it but but</font>

702
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,890
but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the commander is from</font>

703
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,840
something to be held constant because

704
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,990
that's the parameter that the users care

705
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,850
about as you scale the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

706
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:47,040
so if you buy put your limbs you can

707
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:55,330
watch more channels at once as a snack

708
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:59,670
the record i agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it so this is good</font>

709
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:02,230
feedback thing really incorporate those

710
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,500
parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's just a few parts in</font>

711
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,560
the draft and probably ask for the

plenty of people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all review list</font>

715
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,110
came to the microphone

716
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:29,440
no talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction so go</font>

717
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,809
first sup my neighborhood<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font>

718
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,730
time to read this quickly through again

719
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,819
and some of the terminology here is a

720
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit different for it in the ATM</font>

723
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:45,700
we just top-rated beginning is it worth

724
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,529
trying to align this and not talk about

725
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,439
switches but talk about network devices

726
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:52,750
and to use the same definition for a qm

727
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,759
because you have a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more fuzzy</font>

728
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,849
definition and there are things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here</font>

729
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:59,470
that we could make changes to how can we

730
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:03,069
make comments it wouldn't group think

731
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:07,598
that's helpful personally I think that's

732
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:11,950
hopeful then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for review of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

733
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:16,530
to do that consistency in our output is

734
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:19,850
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think ok</font>

735
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:24,210
anything else you will talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about okay I</font>

736
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:33,569
guess we'll be going to talk about it

737
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">ekin here I'll started the pink box away</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very beginning and Michael gave me</font>

742
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,980
the job of doing the last editing

743
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,620
uploading and I managed to mess up the

744
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,000
upload procedure by uploading me a new

745
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,220
version of the individual submission

00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,570
round<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the working group 1 and nobody</font>

748
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,520
deadline had passed and the ID tracker

749
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,960
will now be changed to not let you do

750
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,470
such a stupid thing because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

751
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,640
people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well this hey ed should</font>

752
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,950
spin the archive and then we have to

753
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">conquer do it releases to to make sure</font>

754
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,810
it is replaced by the right one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

755
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,000
sorts of silly stuff and finally

756
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:28,040
admitted the right version and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

757
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,040
took this version which is version wrong

758
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:34,109
to respond to comments provided by the

759
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:37,440
working group and a powerful one so when

760
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:39,869
you talk about this now purpose though

761
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,530
the draft is to present a vision for why

762
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:46,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">people should be using ECM if you think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">which will do something different then</font>

765
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,200
you need to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because the perps</font>

766
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:54,840
this document is to preserve our vision

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:58,200
please use easier if I as the key

second comment we got from<font color="#E5E5E5"> West and it</font>

771
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,970
closest to think again because talking

describing current pitfalls appeared to

779
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:34,560
be maybe not the right language version

<font color="#E5E5E5">2 that tries to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid the word pitfalls</font>

without removing those sessions have

782
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,140
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the bad things that can go</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it uses the real challenges yes</font>

786

00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:15,960
the text here representing us today

789
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,480
because we think it's now ready for

790
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:22,500
wider review in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular where we are</font>

792
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,670
we've uploaded what were the two

793
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,120
versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second version because the</font>

794
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:32,190
second version and has this word change

795
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,589
it just avoids using pitfalls at all

796
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:39,030
goes back to the original words we have

797
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:43,860
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is pretty much good for</font>

798
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:48,710
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> throwing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> websites I tell you</font>

800
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,540
this is where we let the pitfalls

801
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:58,919
because if a person every move and which

802
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,509
may potentially confuse people is I move

803

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bleach your little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box requirements</font>

804
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,950
earlier in the document then because I

805
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,080
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with deployment issues because I</font>

806
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,370
thought this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deployment thing that</font>

807
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,009
you should tell people<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to bleat</font>

808
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,380
cheese here so I do put it at the end

809
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:20,490
where we talked Brett mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

all right i mean my name is already on

818
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:46,390
get up so high Brian channel I have a

819
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:48,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">question about sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope of the</font>

821
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:56,019
pitfalls anymore how crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:44:56,019 --> 00:45:02,019
be I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> the challenges to be</font>

824
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:04,089
motivating the use of ECM this is a

825
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:06,519
statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people that we should be</font>

826
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:08,470
using it yet it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a certain problems</font>

827
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,720
of going away the ITF 11 working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

828
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:13,118
in fact I intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write drafts about</font>

829
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,009
TCM to make it better or to make it work

830
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,589
effectively which i think is a little

831
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:21,220
bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that challenge but Sir concrete</font>

832
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:25,328
example if a challenge to ecn deployment

833
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,609
is that turning on ecn may cause welders

834
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:29,710
that are doing equal cost multipath

835
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:35,109
routing based on hashing the toss bite

836
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:39,569
to break tcp anyhow is that a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep</font>

837
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:39,569
the look on your face is Iraq

838
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:47,970
tcp any guest is already broken because

839
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,950
after I tweeted something about the talk

840
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,750
I gave an ICC orgy I got called out in

841
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter about breaking the internet for</font>

842
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,069
telling people to turn it on but it a

843
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,990
good for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCB anycast when you're</font>

844
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:59,460
bleaching or when you're copying the

845

boss fight so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are wrong with</font>

846

not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't even start acting on</font>

847
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,230
the top of washing on the toss by

848
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:15,990
evening there is equipment that does

849
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:17,400
that he put<font color="#CCCCCC"> something so the point is</font>

850
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,500
the point that I'm making is that if

851
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,880
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well we're</font>

852
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,309
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the problems and</font>

853
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,990
repeating people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document there</font>

854
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:28,079
are people in the community who will say

855
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:30,089
ECM is broken because queasy feeling

856
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,099
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what I saw once or I</font>

857
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:33,750
have some broken equipment or I had a

858
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:36,059
bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm continuing to do the</font>

859
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,230
bad idea I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

860
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,910
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in there but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

861
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,849
supposed to be the one stop shop where's

862
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:44,029
the line I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should talk</font>

863
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:48,390
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we see I was good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> st2</font>

864
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:50,760
honestly anything else either look that

865
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,589
is already broken and stuff this broken

866
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,040
is broken and then it needs to be gonna

867
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:57,720
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed I think you agree we don't want</font>

868
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,470
to get the room since about yeah sure

869
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,470
that's my opinion

870
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:18,060
hendra<font color="#E5E5E5"> McGregor um as far as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know we</font>

871
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:20,190
haven't got had a consensus call or any

872
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:27,750
kind of convention discussion on the

873
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:30,090
question of is the position of ECG and

874
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,130
marking is equivalent to drop correct

875
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,600
and what do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do about trying</font>

00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make things that we have to hire a</font>

880
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a challenge in</font>

881
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:53,399
getting ECM correct and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that is</font>

882
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:54,630
still a work in progress so yes we do

883
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to choose it and we've made some</font>

884
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,590
recommendations in<font color="#CCCCCC"> VA qm recommendations</font>

885
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,180
for things that might need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font>

886
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:04,170
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might need more research on</font>

887
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:06,210
some of these avicii unrelated and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

888
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,950
if people believe us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they start</font>

889
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,980
turning it on we better get on finish

890
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:13,560
these things as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could decide</font>

891
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,270
not to publish this because we believe

892
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,670
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do all the work first and</font>

893
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,920
then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can work up the motivation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

894
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,470
actually doing the work that precise

895
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,109
question is one of the reasons why none

896
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,549
of the documents or implementations

897
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:31,529
about either coddled or if you cuddle

898
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:34,710
say anything about it they probably

899
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:37,080
should but without kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of resolving</font>

900
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:39,710
that question there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of deciding</font>

901
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,710
what

902
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:47,399
hmm doesn't know what to be done yeah

903
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:49,170
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't so sorry I got your</font>

904
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,840
perspective on that and let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

905
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:54,140
that this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be spec for</font>

906
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,120
you seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that modifying you know</font>

907
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,040
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you see end it's about</font>

908
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,799
explaining the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrive they might</font>

909
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it would be the wrong</font>

910
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,240
place actually if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had guidance about</font>

911
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,850
that to stuff it but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good</font>

912
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,620
thing to mention in the Challenger

913
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:13,500
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would encourage people to turn</font>

914
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,910
out and talk about yeah yeah okay like

915
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,490
there is this the place where we

916
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:20,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting the challenges stuff to me that</font>

917
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:22,379
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an information of document</font>

918
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> well well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice to make it</font>

919
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:30,960
work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah yeah but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can talk about</font>

920
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:35,370
listen this is fun making a computer

921
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,660
different topics<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can you per se so I</font>

922
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,859
should have probably brought up this

923
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,870
earlier but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been here to last</font>

924
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,120
meeting sir and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a section</font>

925
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:45,839
saying benefits when<font color="#E5E5E5"> do mock you see an</font>

926
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:50,730
earlier various yeah which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't be</font>

927
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,380
the end of thing between<font color="#CCCCCC"> botany see an</font>

928
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,360
earlier you don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you can</font>

929
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,980
walk earlier no did I understand i don't

930
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">know ken how you can get benefits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

931
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,020
and because so my understanding is if

932
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,630
you map you can earlier you will just

933
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:06,420
reduce your condition into earlier and

934
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:08,730
so the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow who gets a later draw</font>

935
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use all the capacity and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

936
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:12,330
will not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any of the</font>

937
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:14,160
capacity which is might be beneficial

938
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,110
for the operation of network probably

939
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,129
not but it's definitely not beneficial

940
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,130
for the one who's using easy

941
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:30,009
you're near a microphone so recession

942
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,410
the illusion eh i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are benefit</font>

943
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,150
and i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

944
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:41,000
try to do read them but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could</font>

945
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:43,339
be done in in academic papers and

946
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,250
research and we could go that way and

947
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:47,869
that's making this section a little bit

948
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:51,890
shorter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a thing for this</font>

949
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:57,440
working group to decide oh but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Briscoe I</font>

950
00:50:51,890 --> 00:51:00,890
guess the thing Curren presented in ICT

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">RJ was a way to mark ii CN earlier and</font>

952
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:06,710
not lose lose out to drop so it just

953
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs leg embellishing rather than</font>

954
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:14,950
moving to say that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do</font>

955
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:14,950
that naively

956
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:25,649
okay remember this is a manifesto

957
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,029
document not a technical specs so we we

958
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,250
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be able to sort swallow</font>

00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,460
in this room by KO talking and as an

Lots intricately tied with performance

993
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:57,329
it but i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this w no I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be a specification the specification</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rail would otherwise drop and I think we</font>

1000
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">should not changed out our proposed to</font>

1001
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:14,730
change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> despair and remove any</font>

1002

text that says anything about possibly

1003
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,839
marketing area that's level email grant

1004
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,970
will take care that we should talk about

1005
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">what mark when we should what would</font>

1006
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:26,339
otherwise drop means not when an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad I'm</font>

1007
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:27,930
would otherwise drop regarding the salon

1008
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,490
chair on it yeah well we can just

1009
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:31,589
explain this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this is a</font>

1010
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,959
common misconception that it's the same

1011
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:43,980
as a drop tail rotor the same as an AQ m

1012
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:46,319
the region<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe okay I agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I would</font>

1013
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:50,339
still like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see like a side remark if</font>

1014
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:52,140
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed this spec saying not you</font>

1015
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:55,020
have not have to do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> like rub</font>

1016
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,150
anymore if you change it and you change

1017
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,069
also the congestion control you can have

1018
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,740
additional benefits just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making work</font>

1019
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:03,480
somewhere that you know there's more

1020
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,919
coming up which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1021
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,970
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be I think</font>

1022
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,980
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice because if people</font>

1023
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:10,200
read this they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's basically</font>

1024
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:14,339
all stopping you but what's the real

1025
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:17,879
benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and when we just try one</font>

1026
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:19,619
second longer poker and is it a new

1027
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,650
benefit or is it a greater benefit only

1028
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,869
because the benefits we already outlined

1029
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:27,030
in some top-level describing the

1030
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:29,369
different ways you can benefit I believe

1031
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,900
what you're saying actually is a good

1032
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:33,510
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got research also in this</font>

1033
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:37,099
space but it actually just increases the

1034
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:37,099
benefit in those particular cases

1035
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:43,730
the the of the whole system if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

1036
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,930
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> aqm and the different</font>

1037
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:49,670
congestion control then there's a new

1038
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:51,680
benefit that might be doable because

1039
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:54,110
today's congenital needs a certain

1040
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,520
amount of buffering trachea which I've

1041
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,950
utilization and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1042
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,440
higher education and no delay you might

1043
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:02,029
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change those but that's like</font>

1044
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:06,620
this I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might not belong</font>

1045
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:08,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then so the low delays is better</font>

1046
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:21,710
realized because you can make a lot

1047
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:25,580
alike you right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't we will do</font>

1048
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:27,140
what with the text yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave</font>

1049
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:30,350
this pit I'll start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> your scent I</font>

1050
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,759
mean I agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to review it and so if I</font>

1051
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:36,740
have an idea where we can it like one

1052
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:38,300
sentence I were just so welcome work for

1053
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:41,689
trying to do the structural changes here

1054
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:46,930
that are useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will any other topics</font>

1055
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:46,930
because I'm will happily consider them

1056
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:54,260
doesn't look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that means</font>

1057
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:56,569
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> rep three and then I will</font>

1058
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,730
assert that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ref 3 contains all the</font>

1059
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:01,280
feedback which we want to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this</font>

1060
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,170
and therefore that version should get a

1061
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,900
reviewer or I go to we can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost call</font>

1062
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,340
it will go looking real class call thank

1063
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,850
you

1064
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:15,440
so Andrew you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say briefly</font>

1065
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:17,589
status on cuddle no slide straight no

1066
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">show slides and uses micro sis closer</font>

1067
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:23,060
the car will draft we have at this point

1068
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,590
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a number of known editorial</font>

1069
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,820
changes that need to be made a whole

1070
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,850
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reference that's and a few</font>

1071
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:31,220
other such things but in its current

1072
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:32,540
form<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reading for review</font>

1073
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,730
understanding that there are some known

1074
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:37,970
editorial issues stick particularly

1075
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,260
references and when those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolved</font>

1076
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,549
we believe it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're ready for a score</font>

1077
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,920
so if you go to insert<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link if you</font>

1078
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:45,590
poignant now that's that's perfectly

1079
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,720
fine and it won't be too long like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1080
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:51,860
the handful of weeks before we have a

1081
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:53,540
new version that will have the editorial

1082
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,360
issues we already know about resolved

1083
00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:04,160
and that should be you know ready for

1084
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:05,570
serious Rudy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay quick does that mean</font>

1085
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,879
okay that wasn't trying to add something

1086
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:09,830
the experiences section if he can frame

1087
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,110
more information there as well everybody

1088
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,730
has any data that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide to us</font>

1089
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:18,320
driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experience section that will</font>

1090
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:24,500
be fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Martha lesson I</font>

1091
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:25,940
i have i have some reservations about

1092
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,040
the behave

1093
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:30,380
that happens when it enters this drop

1094
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:34,759
mode the part of the square root I've

1095
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,720
seen strange things and I can share them

1096
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,390
off run and we can have a discussion

1097
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,660
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think about black tab</font>

1098
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,920
more justification about this part not

1099
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:50,000
the problem the first choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1100
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:54,619
repeated dropping the idea the idea with

1101
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,160
this document is to document coral as as

1102
00:57:54,619 --> 00:58:00,290
it was originally published in<font color="#CCCCCC"> his here</font>

1103
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,690
out there in the wild rather than do

1104
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">further development on it now all right</font>

1105
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> further algorithm development is a</font>

1106
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:09,220
good thing but and we'd certainly like

1107
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,300
to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and probably publish</font>

1108
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,970
it would also be nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how that</font>

1109
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:18,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy can observe that same behavior in</font>

1110
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:20,839
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> coddle for and I don't want to</font>

1111
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:22,490
grab get in the way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process here</font>

1112
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:24,549
of documenting what stairs I think

1113
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:27,319
that's a very good thing to do so I

1114
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,900
think it might have a sexual or maybe I

1115
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:31,970
suggest you re we're already on the

1116
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:34,220
future work in you know other research

1117
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:36,290
because it certainly mentions in many

1118
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,879
places and document some some other

1119
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,230
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be poked into and</font>

1120
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:45,020
maybe that's just a candidate for that

1121
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:46,720
yes west-east we could do that and just

1122
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:48,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you</font>

1123
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,649
there was a mile i wrote reviewing

1124
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:54,340
cuddle on the list that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

1125
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:59,680
promise to answer at some point maybe

1126
00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:02,800
two years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> now i set it to kathy</font>

1127
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">nichols and fan and no one ever answered</font>

1128
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:11,260
it and then you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have its green</font>

1129
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:14,500
carnal dragoness and this does anything

1130
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,210
else that's all we have for today thank

1131
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,300
you for coming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> participating and we</font>

1132
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:20,500
