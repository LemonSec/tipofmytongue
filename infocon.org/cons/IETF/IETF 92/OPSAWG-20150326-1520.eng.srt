00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing ad so this is between brackets</font>

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,710
meaning that she won't have much<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font>

welcome so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a small time</font>

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,080
commitment we put in there like

65
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,430
one-third of someone's time just to make

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,010
sure it were serious about it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

know to help with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development and</font>

71
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">culmination of the numerous yang models</font>

72
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,440
within the ITF and the promotion of

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,520
young modeling in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry so I come</font>

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in couple of slides now</font>

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> page there feel free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

follow that one we have a we keep their

77
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">with plenty of information and we're</font>

78
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:21,810
linking this with the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font>

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:23,969
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I won't be reading all</font>

80
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,610
this but typically the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> description</font>

81
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:30,330
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> inventory of yang models the</font>

82
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,690
first thing we want to do then trying to

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">evaluate all how all these young models</font>

84
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,280
fit together this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend you</font>

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,410
have it's the next thing we will need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,849
do and you will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are many of</font>

87
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,780
these young models if you were in the

88
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,150
routing session just before it's a also

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,590
discussed there there is a design team

90
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,400
in routing to evaluate how to fit these

91
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,880
models together

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,219
so documenting backtrack documenting and

93
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,090
tracking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on issues leading the</font>

94
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,639
discussions on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resolution</font>

95
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:11,789
and open issues participating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

96
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:14,729
design teams and that's it basically you

97
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:17,039
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to learn along the time</font>

98
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,830
how this job will evolve but it's read a

99
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,349
promotion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> young now on the next</font>

100
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,620
slide what I want to show is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> capella</font>

101
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,330
of of the outcome what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font>

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,220
so far because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give regular</font>

103
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,199
updates the first thing was the

104
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,789
inventory yes we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

105
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,680
there is like a big wave of young

106
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,710
mothers or even it's tsunami but

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,070
actually how many it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even difficult to</font>

108
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,448
know so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did in the hackathon</font>

109
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,479
during the weekend with young<font color="#E5E5E5"> med</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

110
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:48,690
is we wrote a script that download the

111
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,258
IGF draft extract the young models and

112
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,969
see if they compile right so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

113
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,699
this page there and you could throw the

114
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,590
link directly from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a from the page i</font>

115
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,440
mentioned before so you see on the

116
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:05,520
left-hand side the module name then

117
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,889
welcome from which draft then a link to

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,049
the author you want to just click and

119
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,970
send an email to them with what was the

120
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,030
outcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the compilation there that</font>

121
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,870
felt right and just checking their if it

122
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,698
passed or failed and on the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

123
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:24,690
some numbers so how many young mothers

124
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:27,120
do we have well we have to differentiate

125
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,120
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that extract correctly</font>

126
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,820
and the one that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good yang</font>

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,280
models so we run that this morning we've

128
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:41,159
got like 118 young models in the ITF the

129
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:47,030
one at X<font color="#CCCCCC"> crack extract correctly out of</font>

130
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:47,030
these only<font color="#E5E5E5"> 28 just pass the compilation</font>

131
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:53,820
we should improve that right there are

132
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,430
some of the error in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could agree</font>

133
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,949
with that's fine and it's very simple

134
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:03,409
binary outcome it<font color="#E5E5E5"> passes there is no</font>

135
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:06,780
return string or it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't pass now</font>

136
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:10,530
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was 200</font>

137
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,599
18 total yang models the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the</font>

138
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">but one the one more not too sure the</font>

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:19,500
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones at cetera so there is room</font>

140
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">for improvement there right now this is</font>

141
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,400
some my pride website the plan is to

142
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,990

that is post is being posted at this

typical error there I won't go there in

148
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,449
details but you know the typical one

149
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,120
you're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put code begins and</font>

150
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ends there some people don't put</font>

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so we're tables</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to sure if</font>

152
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,300
it's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> on out there are young</font>

153
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,000
models<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indra that are just examples so</font>

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,130
it's right not to put that but just

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,820
don't use like could begin instead of

156
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,640
God begins don't use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lowercase</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font>

157
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,130
put the end at the end all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

158
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,220
we've been warning all the author please

160
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,050
by the way don't put XXX there I mean if

161
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,449
you're not too sure about your yang

162
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,569
module name right every single person

163
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:25,920
put XXX so we've got five or six XXX

164
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:29,100
yang models that doesn't help right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

165
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide so posting the code is being</font>

done right now we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to integrate this</font>

there might be valid it might be working

174
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,270
progress fair enough but at least we

175
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,250
want to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay please make sure you</font>

179
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,110
it's about promoting yang<font color="#CCCCCC"> in industry</font>

180
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,960
we've got plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of young models that</font>

181
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,880
are outside the IDF right and we've got

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> indifferent s do some in open</font>

check it was

186
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,620
like three or four hundred yang models

187
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:28,680
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that's a superset of</font>

201
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,860
modeling that's fine with me and rather

202
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:13,380
neutral by the way so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

203
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,820
process of establishing all the contacts

204
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,040
and I'm not a strong believer in liaison

205
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,750
you know I can imagine sending a liaison

206
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,149
to the opendaylight people will laugh at

207
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I'm just more believer in to building</font>

208
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,050
bigger communities so that's what we're

209
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,329
trying to do right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

210
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,029
hackathon this this weekend was<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

211
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:37,470
that you will heard about what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

212
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:39,600
with with young later on for the people

213
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,080
involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different SEOs please review</font>

214
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,190
this and please comment if the status is

215
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,940
right all right next slide the outcome

216
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,890
number three these days it seemed that I

217
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,260
spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of my meeting time</font>

218
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,080
discussing yang that's a good one to

219
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,589
have but most of the time it boils down

220
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the right technology like okay</font>

221
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,660
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether a service is</font>

222
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,660
this a network service is it's a

223
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,540
business service what about you know

224
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,209
protocol yang models what about standard

225
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,189
one what about standard extension what

226
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,959
about proprietary extension to start

227
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,880
model what about proprietary model and I

228
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,339
advise you to review this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,320
is draft but none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which there that's</font>

230
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be pretty useful for all these</font>

231
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,730
discussions within the ITF like for

232
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:40,360
example is<font color="#E5E5E5"> superb of</font>

233
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:43,779
but also outside of the ITF right all

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,829
right that's it on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one then</font>

235
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:50,139
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard many times that we need</font>

236
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,449
training on that come from yang and at

237
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:55,420
different level right and that makes

238
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:58,839
sense now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this group</font>

239
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,180
on having a training online that would

240
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,050
you know be useful for multiple

241
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,969
audiences first one what is this not

242
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,410
come from yang anywhere right I heard

243
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,180
it's cool it's the right thing to do

244
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,540
these days but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this first</font>

245
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,269
audience the second one is I would like

246
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:20,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">to develop a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yang a young model right</font>

247
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:24,010
can you help me then the third one is

248
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,130
coding i'm coding around yang models

249
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:30,100
which libraries choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> it city road you</font>

250
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,579
have and a fourth one that we've been

251
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussing here today we're with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gary is</font>

252
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,750
what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would be someone up and</font>

253
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,790
daylight and i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to you know</font>

254
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,519
just create an ITF draft or what should

255
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,410
i do and yan will be discussing that

256
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:49,870
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed part of this in the</font>

257
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:52,689
hackathon it's the project started we

258
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,519
received some funding to just get some

259
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,209
professional editing of this this

260
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,290
training so wait and you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

261
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,729
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hopefully provide feedback</font>

262
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,800
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get like a training that</font>

263
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,639
could be extended with more things along

264
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,300
the time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outcome of the five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

265
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:17,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide now one of the big questions</font>

266
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,229
is at least in my mind is yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see a</font>

267
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:23,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of yang models all over the place</font>

268
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,440
and we could just be happy but i'm

269
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,579
wondering are we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> sun rising</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

270
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,790
right yang models what<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 40 operators</font>

271
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:36,899
right so I've been asking some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

272
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:41,230
operators that I know in your the ITF

273
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:43,930
tell me which one you're missing which

274
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,769
one we should be working on right and

275
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,599
there are two types of young models the

276
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,970
the one at our services one and the one

277
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are below an Orchestrator right I'm</font>

278
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,970
mainly interested in to these like okay

279
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:00,929
sure we but one on is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and one on ospf</font>

280
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,929
one but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to identify the</font>

281
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:08,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">gaps in what we're doing in the ITF is</font>

282
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:12,600
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> so typically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like having a</font>

283
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:15,809
technology and and this RFC so it's not

284
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">really useful to say support ipv6 right</font>

285
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:20,309
but tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would need to have the</font>

286
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,849
configuration state and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal</font>

287
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:25,379
state of dat privacy and then if we

288
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,379
would match what we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in at the</font>

289
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,850
beginning right with the inventory and

290
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:31,639
and the less the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements on the</font>

291
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:35,069
operators you could see what is missing

292
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:38,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again the inventory should be</font>

293
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:40,529
in multiple sdl an open source project

294
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,730
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a goal so please drop me an</font>

295
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,860
email if you have that type of

296
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:51,959
information and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> one oh and that's</font>

297
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:55,379
it yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ardmore level three can</font>

298
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,729
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> previous slide um it</font>

299
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,679
would be kind of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a what not</font>

300
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,149
to standardize some guidelines you know

301
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,600
we'll we'll talk about this with your

302
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:05,149
services thing later but I at least in

303
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,949
the IP MPLS based people have always

304
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,559
walked this fuzzy line of trying to put

305
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,959
out rfcs for features that don't eat

306
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">interop and now i can see people</font>

307
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,529
churning out yang models for things that

308
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:21,209
don't need them for services for stuff

309
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,009
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make sense to a lot of</font>

310
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:25,109
us it'd be kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool to have some</font>

311
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,490
guidelines about at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least the priority</font>

312
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,160
in which the IETF wants to develop

313
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,209
certain kinds of young models<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fully</font>

314
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,399
agree with that that you could go back

315
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:39,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the outcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it was the</font>

316
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">three them number three</font>

317
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,210
this is my answer exactly for that

318
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,459
reason I want you have etymology like

319
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,190
what is network service what is a

320
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,690
business service and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I don't</font>

321
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,960
believe we should be doing any business

322
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:58,270
service model in the ITF so this energy

323
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,090
will help me discussing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with different</font>

324
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,860
SDOs and like with the MAF they have a

325
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,750
different notion of service<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

326
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,360
will do that part of the service will do

327
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,270
networking part if any a few of them in

328
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,770
the ITF so yes I'm relying<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this to</font>

329
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,959
have that discussion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fully agree</font>

330
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,569
with you we should not be all the

331
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,280
service in the world in the ITF maybe a

332
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:24,970
few of them and i'll discuss that in the

333
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:34,510
l3 sm talk Eric<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait I think that</font>

334
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:37,450
magazine work Eric Floyd I think one of

335
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,370
the good things that would be worth

336
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">while adding is not just what the yang</font>

337
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,979
model is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font>

338
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the ideas of what are you can use it</font>

339
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for example the interface model</font>

340
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,280
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many uses for its some are</font>

341
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,680
very high volume some are very low

342
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,410
volume some need a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bits the model</font>

343
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,740
others should be pushed<font color="#CCCCCC"> so while we can</font>

344
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,020
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the models I often find</font>

345
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,730
that the usages even in the cross

346
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,740
reference that you had before are

347
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,170
extremely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of volume</font>

348
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,630
scale and other types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information so</font>

349
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,460
it would be helpful to the operators to

350
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,420
get the idea of when you had like a

351
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:19,660
model what are you going to do with it

352
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:22,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so Eric have we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done that with the</font>

353
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">MIPS like the interface myth or I mean</font>

354
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is different with yang compared to</font>

355
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,420
meps because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

356
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,560
been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with MIT modules there</font>

357
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,820
are somehow self-explanatory agreed it

358
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,149
gets back into the difference between

359
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,389
configuration data and operational data

360
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,700
and for configuration certainly you're

361
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,830
going to have expected volumes and even

362
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,720
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for ACL configuration</font>

363
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,500
sometimes you run into blocking factors

364
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acl's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can add or</font>

365
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,690
move we start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like hrs with</font>

366
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,060
actually getting the route updates and

367
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,620
the route flaps in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time and you're</font>

368
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,919
expecting that out of let's say some

369
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,659
interface and routing a yang model

370
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,690
you're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot different</font>

371
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,940
behavior as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topology changes for one</font>

372
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,560
thing versus another so even the

373
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,730
discussions were having on push are you

374
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use this model for a push</font>

375
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,980
versus not these kinds of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

376
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,840
interesting I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information model</font>

377
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is great how you use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dimension</font>

378
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,770
scale in other ways

379
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:35,510
presentation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm next to and what</font>

380
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,610
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussing about the services</font>

381
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:41,750
model is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perfect introduction for</font>

382
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:45,949
this it's an ad three VPN service model

383
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,480
it's a new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group l3 at em one of</font>

384
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,900
the question I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been having for some</font>

385
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,200
time now is should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid ice service</font>

386
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:59,330
gang models in the IDF to come back to

387
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">eric's point before and should we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

388
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:05,960
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so nice any service young model at</font>

389
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:11,630
all now what we did on the next slide is

390
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:15,440
that we had a design team of<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

391
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:18,770
operators no<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors in there and we</font>

392
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,590
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them could you please try to see</font>

393
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,820
if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some commodities into your</font>

394
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,439
configuration of an l-3 p.m. right and

395
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:32,510
could you try to get us a kind of

396
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:36,110
information model in whatever text for

397
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,810
example and they work together with<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

398
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:42,679
x I mean bi-weekly meetings and they

399
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:47,710
came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft on this the draft</font>

400
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:52,850
is there and they produced<font color="#CCCCCC"> a young model</font>

401
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:56,510
out of this directly in two and half

402
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:59,409
months and somehow it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a small</font>

403
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:02,890
proof concept that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so lysing</font>

404
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,960
maybe a couple of services young models

405
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,820
so on next slide what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to do is</font>

406
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,650
simply highlight a few things on the

407
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,060
Charter and explain the rationale behind

408
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:15,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">us this is a short clip working group</font>

409
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,750
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back the first question</font>

410
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:22,040
should we turn thy service young madam

411
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,790
the ITF let's try fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail fast</font>

412
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,680
right if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no agreement amongst</font>

413
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,700
operators that or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

414
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:35,420
acknowledges we should not do it now so

415
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:38,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a young model it described an ultra</font>

416
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,110
VPN service model that can be used for

417
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,480
coming

418
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,719
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> between customers and network</font>

419
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,690
operators so one of an operator asked is

420
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,380
own customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what you want do you</font>

421
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:54,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have ipv4 ipv6 weeks topology</font>

422
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:59,990
tenants customers etc this is at this

423
00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">level right nothing else so all right</font>

424
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:08,179
next one we want it to stress I think we

425
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:12,980
must move it to the other day<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

426
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:14,840
sorry this is yellow and yellow yeah

427
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,440
yellow and yellow are lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> text mr.</font>

428
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,470
right right so we want to stress this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

429
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,140
not an ad three configuration model if

430
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are a vendor and you try to put in</font>

431
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,690
there all the config knobs that you have

432
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:32,270
for your l3 VPN and all aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

433
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:36,919
an igp<font color="#CCCCCC"> an access list and aqui OS</font>

434
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,440
whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so it's</font>

435
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">just between an operator and its</font>

436
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:48,740
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one so that</font>

437
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,380
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> help me if we succeed with this and</font>

438
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm confident because you know we've</font>

439
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,480
seen so many young models but somehow

440
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,970
the challenge we have right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

441
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,790
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> must work together and we've got</font>

442
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,330
three types of young models the one that

443
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:08,059
are the services between typically and

444
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,820
BSS and an OSS / controller /

445
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">orchestrator whatever the name right</font>

446
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,730
then we've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

447
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,970
configuring network elements there are

448
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,309
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these in the ITF and in the</font>

449
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,400
OSS we've got like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a topology at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

450
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:25,668
and all of these they must work together

451
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,100
right in the end up at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of the</font>

452
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,200
day we're creating all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

453
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,159
specific gang models what for for

454
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,150
operators to create new services that's

455
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:41,510
why this LG between is somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tests</font>

456
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:44,000
can we have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at VPN service</font>

457
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,980
model do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all the building block</font>

458
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,070
that we need in configuring the network

459
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,600
elements right and that would be a good

460
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,299
test all this should be coming together

461
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,260
with the topology from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike urs in</font>

462
00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:02,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">orchestrator so I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this like</font>

463
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:05,220
your homework like does the ITF do his

464
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:12,059
homework in terms of having the right

465
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:14,850
yang models solid ice and next one so

466
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,950
what you wrote in there is that this

467
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,070
drug that those operators came up with

468
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:24,150
should be consider as a good start right

469
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start now I say</font>

470
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:30,059
I believe because who am I to say that

471
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the right of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong questions</font>

472
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:36,690
that those operators are asking to their

473
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:39,659
customers right and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an</font>

474
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:42,000
aggressive milestone when I see what has

475
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:45,750
been done in three months with this

476
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,270
draft and I believe this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

477
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,860
draft already need some improvements

478
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,799
need some more feedback from multiple

479
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,320
operators that's for sure then we want

480
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,970
to just say can we agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> in let's say</font>

481
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,020
one year since we started with the

482
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:03,059
design team on how to do a service we

483
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,280
fell we fell that's fine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want you</font>

484
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:08,610
any service young mothers at all no big

485
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal but I believe will succeed so I</font>

486
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:15,830
think that fits so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

487
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:19,380
feedback on this one yes Eric Eric

488
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,970
Hosmer again sorry I mean true ITF

489
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,500
fashion didn't understand this and

490
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,390
didn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same time spoke</font>

491
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,419
out against it in that confer net modern

492
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,740
out whatever was um I unless I have

493
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,200
fewer pitchforks now because it makes

494
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,770
more sense but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do have a couple</font>

495
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,909
concerns you know the objection I'd made

496
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,379
the other day that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have as much</font>

497
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:41,640
anymore is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think the ITF</font>

498
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,549
should be in the business of service

499
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,640
models right we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITU and I</font>

500
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:50,730
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be but the other</font>

501
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that's going to stick is that if</font>

502
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,150
this is an RFC especially if it's a

503
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,799
proposed standard and turns into

504
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:59,790
standard then it's going to show up on

505
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:00,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">our F piece</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't get why it's a</font>

506
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,730
proposed standard instead of

507
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,510
experimental given what you've described

508
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,920
and

509
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,710
it would be kind of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it had</font>

510
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,320
something in the top that said this is

511
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the model this is a science</font>

512
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,460
experiment you know something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

513
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,380
it just helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if I don't actually</font>

514
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to implement this and the dashboard</font>

515
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,130
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> give my customers or something like</font>

516
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I mean I understand and I</font>

517
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,080
agree with that now I mean whenever you

518
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,740
see you tell me doing to appear in our

519
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,220
FB which ones are we not from my

520
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,110
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me right do you support</font>

521
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,430
this and such yang model and then you

522
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,439
need to say no but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got something</font>

523
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,360
better based on this yeah but we all

524
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,430
know that game doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah no but</font>

525
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,770
I get your point it's a buddy the one I

526
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,920
mean I'm not married to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some attract</font>

527
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,830
right it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like the definition of an</font>

528
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:55,370
experiment which is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good okay</font>

529
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:57,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea Jason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stern alcatel-lucent</font>

530
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,139
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> correctly in your</font>

531
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,450
classification model the you were that

532
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,340
then Bogdanovic did this would sit up

533
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,050
kind of above the orchestrator not

534
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,189
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> orchestrator in the and the</font>

535
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:13,050
nodes exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that sounds good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

536
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,600
guess the other the other question I

537
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,889
have is it sounds like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right group</font>

538
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,929
of people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a set of</font>

539
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:22,890
operators I guess I I would one one

540
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,930
thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably important</font>

541
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,030
though is those operators are actually

542
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:30,200
operating services using a wide variety

543
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:32,639
of vendors so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had five operators</font>

544
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,770
involved that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's a good</font>

545
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,900
setup a good set but if they're all

546
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,000
using one vendor for example to actually

547
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,580
implement services then the model may

548
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,960
not represent enough may not take into

549
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,149
account enough variety and services

550
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,240
models so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just encourage that</font>

551
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,630
group make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operators have</font>

552
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,220
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of vendors on which they've</font>

553
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,110
implemented services in the network I

554
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,120
would agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that now I've got a</font>

555
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,209
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you so do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

556
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the operators would have different</font>

557
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,130
questions their customers whenever

558
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,510
enabling<font color="#E5E5E5"> an l-3 VPN based on the</font>

559
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,640
different vendors and I don't speak

560
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,220
about like the secret sauce right on the

561
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,450
extension but a very basic atropine do

562
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,500
you believe those questions would be

563
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,110
different

564
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:21,510
I think it's influenced by how different

565
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:23,040
vendors see and construct services so i

566
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,240
think i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> its a mix there's</font>

567
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,430
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that's just purely</font>

568
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,630
between an operator and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer but</font>

569
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the way the way services can</font>

570
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,080
be constructed right down on equipment

571
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,120
does actually flow through an effect

572
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,949
thinking about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> services should be</font>

573
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeled so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to make sure</font>

574
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,430
there's encouraged to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure there's</font>

575
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:53,790
a wide variety of vendors being used by

576
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:56,250
those operators thank you and Kathleen

577
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,690
was going to be presenting I think on

578
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,670
dots but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i have a</font>

579
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,610
presentation nor do we seem to have a

580
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,650
kathleen so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me try and find the</font>

emailed to me pardon great do you need

583
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,310
slides to talk great you talk how<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

584
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box has been removed so yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

585
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:28,290
right hi my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick Teague I'm from</font>

586
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:31,950
verisign Kathleen sponsored are they are

587
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">both on dots dots I just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

588
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,850
few minutes here just to raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> awareness</font>

589
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,250
really dot stands for ddos open threat

590
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,260
signaling our goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce a</font>

591
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:45,060
standard way it sort of sits between the

592
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:47,150
security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ops kind of areas we</font>

593
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,889
wanted to produce a standard way for

594
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:52,560
devices on premise d dos devices that

595
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,630
are currently sitting in many people's

596
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:59,750
networks to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate up to</font>

597
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:02,850
other devices or service providers and

598
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:05,910
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that vein we've created a a</font>

599
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:08,189
draft and we got the buff going and from

600
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,840
the ball we've decided we obviously have

601
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main lesson from that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

602
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a working</font>

603
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,969
group going so it's just basically to

604
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,340
raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness if you check out datsun</font>

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">ITF if you check out dots at IETF</font>

606
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,439
mailing list and yeah if you're

607
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,110
interested please get involved if you

608
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have anything</font>

609
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:30,070
again please hit me up hi Eric Osborne

610
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,540
again I just this idea of communicating

611
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,309
denial of service is it intended to be

612
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,740
within a provider or some sort of inter

613
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:38,260
provider thing um it's probably wasn't

614
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,299
very clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a from a</font>

615
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,440
customer to a provider so if I'm an

616
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,960
enterprise and I've gone out and bought

617
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,030
big shiny DDoS mitigation box number one

618
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,740
and I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in my network then I can</font>

619
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,649
only choose a service provider that also

620
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,230
uses big shiny d<font color="#CCCCCC"> dos providers be no</font>

621
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,080
service provider one equipment to signal

622
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,730
to if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using another one I have two</font>

623
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,409
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different set of providers</font>

624
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,880
that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe go to the idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

625
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,950
open that up so that if I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy</font>

626
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna throw some brand names around if I</font>

627
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:09,100
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy an arbor I can talk to I know</font>

verisign or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prolexic or whoever if I go</font>

629
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,639
and buy a rad where I can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so that that's what we're</font>

631
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,540
trying to do is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and break that</font>

632
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">vertical that's currently there where</font>

633
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,178
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know everything's kind</font>

634
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,440
of all in a row all the way down you

635
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,480
know someone's getting ready yang<font color="#CCCCCC"> moil</font>

636
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">for details right yeah I'm just waiting</font>

637
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm waiting for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> young model request</font>

638
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,730
that's go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D dusting yeah that'll</font>

639
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,080
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing but but then again you</font>

640
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,669
know so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're looking is</font>

641
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,168
it's more signaling thing with this but

642
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:36,520
yeah I mean eventually somebody's gonna

643
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:39,100
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because it's we're gonna</font>

644
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,840
be we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be looking to export</font>

645
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,189
telemetry data you know on the attack

646
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,899
profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so the provider can do</font>

647
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,100
stuff that they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing I was</font>

648
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">only half kidding i think that may be</font>

649
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,120
the right way to do you know some sort

650
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:51,899
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> external nni yeah yeah it could be</font>

651
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much soon</font>

652
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:24,730
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose you're speaking on</font>

653
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this great so I'll describe a few</font>

654
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,170
projects that we did at the hackathon

655
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,170
over the weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hackathon that</font>

656
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:34,480
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned in his talk the</font>

657
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:38,670
first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did or that a couple</font>

658
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">people did was import the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF syslog</font>

659
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:45,970
model into open daylight running on

660
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux and have actually Linux config</font>

661
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:53,260
syslog files be configured<font color="#CCCCCC"> over neck</font>

662
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">cones we're basically open daylight</font>

663
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:59,140
acted as an agent for<font color="#CCCCCC"> alien icebox these</font>

664
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,090
are the developers there are four guys

665
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,760
from four different companies that in

666
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:06,399
itself was was really good demonstrated

667
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,610
a cooperation of different people from

668
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,560
different environments different parts

669
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,840
of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> are getting together over</font>

670
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:20,379
the weekend and and hacking out some

671
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:24,699
code and the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to implement the</font>

672
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:28,750
proposed yang model and the

673
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:33,100
configuration of Linux and it was done

674
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:37,780
as an open daylight project and it was

675
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:41,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented in Java next slide so this</font>

676
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the model it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a few parts for</font>

677
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:47,290
configuring logging actions console

678
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:50,949
logging actions following actions and so

679
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:54,460
forth a fairly simple model but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it uses</font>

680
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:59,140
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advanced concepts that like</font>

681
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:03,190
identities and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices and so forth so</font>

682
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:08,350
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-written and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fast</font>

683
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:13,470
maturing model next fine then the demo

684
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:16,469
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the code they</font>

685
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,469
implemented

686
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:24,030
and debug and test it and then

687
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,980
demonstrate it over a GUI adding some

688
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,779
configuration and ensuring it in the

689
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:39,940
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> file and the results are</font>

690
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:43,139
in the hackathon wiki and also the code

691
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:47,800
already has been posted in tutorials in

692
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:49,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opendaylight tutorials repository so</font>

693
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,909
it's in addition to being unkind of

694
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,790
useful little utility it's also a great

695
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:56,830
example how to import models into open

696
00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:01,480
daylight now<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide</font>

697
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:05,830
this shows an auto-generated GUI from a

698
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:08,050
model from the syslog model where the

699
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:11,020
fields that are defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the model are</font>

700
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,630
put into agree and an operator or a

701
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,759
programmer can immediately use the GUI

702
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,570
that is generated from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model this is</font>

703
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,360
a feature of open daylight so as we

704
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,960
progress with the modeling activities

705
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,280
you will see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of automation tools</font>

706
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,340
emerging both an open sir and probably

707
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,300
in commercial as well that can generate

708
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,160
api's rest api is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so forth out of</font>

709
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,520
models and this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

710
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,879
example when you take a model you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

711
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,600
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a a GUI generated out of that</font>

712
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,690
immediately usable GUI right after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

713
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:54,339
bat<font color="#E5E5E5"> then write a single line of code for</font>

714
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:57,310
the GUI next line and this is a kind of

715
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,030
a neat little tool that just again built

716
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:04,299
into open daylight so you take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

717
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,560
and you visualize it as a as a graph

718
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,740
basically it's a graph visualization

719
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,150
tool and in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

720
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,399
different types in a model and the

721
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,800
different leaves and a different that

722
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can add one you know kind of</font>

723
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-shot see a structure of your model</font>

724
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:24,819
and we imported a bunch of other models

725
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:27,589
as well like the open config model it's

726
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,079
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more complex than this and</font>

727
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:34,339
also can again start using some of these

728
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,349
tools to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assess the couplings and</font>

729
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,960
bindings and relationships between

730
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:41,569
different attributes and different

731
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:47,979
containers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and different parts of your</font>

732
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:52,670
model in in 11 big picture next slide

733
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:55,299
another really nice project was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

734
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:59,930
service function chaining and<font color="#E5E5E5"> neck conf</font>

735
00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:02,660
the issue there were six developers but

736
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,308
I I only got the names of the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

737
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,719
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ones that were there</font>

738
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:11,630
and are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned here but what I</font>

739
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,680
wanted to do is automate the process of

740
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:19,460
device discovery you know SDN controller

741
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,460
and then mapping those devices into

742
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,140
service function chaining or in the

743
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,920
inter-services chaining application

744
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:31,940
running on open daylight so and they use

745
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,599
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> neck count devices to do the auto</font>

746
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:39,950
discovery and the mapping and again like

747
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:43,130
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to bring the whole thing up</font>

748
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,169
over the weekend and demonstrate it and

749
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:51,519
you can see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video the demonstration</font>

750
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:51,519
on this this slide here looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

751
00:37:53,810 --> 00:38:05,160
then another project was a tools project

752
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:06,960
to create an RFC template out of a young

753
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,540
models so the starting point is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> young</font>

754
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,880
model and then basically create all the

755
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:17,910
boilerplate text for a new draft out of

756
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,740
that yang model and again there's there

757
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:22,859
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

758
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,259
weekend and they demonstrated a nice

759
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:29,070
gooey where you upload a young model and

760
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">out comes in RFC to XML a template out</font>

761
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:37,110
of it and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final project was</font>

762
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Benoit's and mine and we did that that</font>

763
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:44,490
extraction tool they've been already

764
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:51,509
described so next slide next slide the

765
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:53,819
next slide yes so the hackathon overall

766
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,230
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were in addition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the net</font>

767
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,610
com projects there were other projects

768
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well either of them something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

769
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:04,890
that in that order<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

770
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,750
success and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of really good code</font>

771
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">got got hacked out and the hackathon</font>

772
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:19,470
will be repeated at<font color="#E5E5E5"> IIT of 93 in Prague</font>

773
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the weekend before ietf and again</font>

774
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:25,259
like the emphasis emphasis will be on

775
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:29,790
open source and standards and we're open

776
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:32,970
source and standards overlap or where

777
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:35,450
they have a common intersection any

778
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,450
questions

779
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,660
okay thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thank you</font>

780
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:49,599
I even open mic thing I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

781
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:57,269
so notice is the open mic session for

782
00:39:55,109 --> 00:40:01,469
any topic that you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

783
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:03,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">ups area so topic for the full array</font>

784
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:15,390
itself after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

785
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:17,400
the apps AWG meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> l martin i just</font>

786
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,779
like to briefly mention and I'll back

787
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,069
away from the microphone because it's

788
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:27,709
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gecko here is tremendous that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

789
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:27,709
Kathleen Moore oh she's on the agenda

790
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:40,650
what do you mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just heard her okay I</font>

791
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:43,079
so I walked in late obviously but this

792
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,150
draft is something we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

793
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,739
comments on and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion is under</font>

794
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:52,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sag list oh sorry there we go stupid</font>

795
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:56,239
cable so that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's covered</font>

796
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,239
excellent thanks very much

797
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,860
but Lee Howard since we're open mic time

798
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,440
we did an experiment in v6 ops this week

799
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">we kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done a little bit before</font>

800
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,120
where we invited speakers to give sort

801
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,830
of deployment experience field reports

802
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,380
on protocols that have been standardized

803
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,310
the IETF and and and actually get

804
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,050
operators who are running those

805
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,759
protocols to come and tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

806
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,010
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've had really</font>

807
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,750
positive feedback on that and so I

808
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,990
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage my you know other</font>

809
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:34,230
people in the area to both if you if you

810
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:36,899
can find time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on agenda to do that give</font>

811
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,670
it a try but also looking for what other

812
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,400
things we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking for and b6</font>

813
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,930
ops to ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a feedback on and</font>

814
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,880
especially if you know somebody who has

815
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,640
deployed something that maybe we don't

816
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,160
know what the experience is like good

817
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,480
feedback for us to then write further

818
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,480
drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

819
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:04,569
then thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and we'll leave the table</font>

820
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:17,130
for a world and Scott for the observer

821
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:17,130
ug so hello this is now up say WG yep

822
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,790
here is the note well again it should be

823
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:27,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">identical to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you walked</font>

824
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:31,240
in a few minutes ago where's us

825
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,980
whoever's taking minutes will<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mind</font>

826
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,410
continuing to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes for the rest</font>

827
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,470
of this and also please don't forget

828
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:45,490
send us minutes at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I can't</font>

829
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:47,230
remember who is taking minutes who is

830
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:51,490
taking minutes would you mind putting up

831
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:53,619
a hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great joel is as well okay</font>

832
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,779
blue sheets hopefully those already

833
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:57,400
circulating this is the administrivia

834
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,609
section then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

835
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,369
update from by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris Grundmann do I have</font>

836
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,960
your slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great and then cap up</font>

837
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:08,619
control and data separation from what

838
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a scenario a quick update on</font>

839
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:14,950
our documents since the last meeting we

840
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:18,339
have two new rfcs seven working group

841
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:20,348
documents one of which is active two of

842
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:22,420
them have completed working group last

843
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:27,670
call actually that's no longer correct

844
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,079
the char to usm SNMP is now with the is

845
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">geez that should have been moved down</font>

846
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,790
but it only happened I think yesterday

847
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,430
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something so I didn't update the</font>

848
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:40,000
slides the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MM mabe should be done soon</font>

849
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:43,328
and we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have three drafts with the</font>

850
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,660
RFC editor so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're moving along</font>

851
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">nicely although not sure of measuring</font>

852
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,290
working group performance by the number

853
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,240
of documents is actually a useful metric

854
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:56,099
but that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're using because it</font>

855
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,098
works well um and

856
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:12,580
we will now have Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grundmann if i</font>

857
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:12,580
can find the slides don't make it yellow

858
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:19,240
it's okay yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll fit it with it</font>

859
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh-huh slideshow play from stop and if</font>

860
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:32,600
you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a second I will get the</font>

861
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:39,380
colors right again there we go do you

862
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:42,230
want to use the cookie thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um</font>

863
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,670
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're in the epi I apg</font>

864
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,360
meeting you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen the slides</font>

865
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:48,320
at least and really what I'm doing is in

866
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,510
Honolulu I came and talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

867
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,710
survey at the end I society did yawns or

868
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,110
talked about at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting before that</font>

869
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,010
we're still conducting the survey we

870
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,690
basically went out and surveyed

871
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,310
operators all around the world and ask

872
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,920
them kind of what they knew about the

873
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:02,600
IHF whether they thought they should be

874
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,700
participate or not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if they</font>

875
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,220
thought they should and weren't why they

876
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,600
weren't I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for barriers to</font>

877
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,029
entry basically looking for the reasons

878
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,350
why operators don't show up at the ITF

879
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,850
in more numbers in higher numbers of

880
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">mate they do obviously there's there's</font>

881
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,880
many folks here who do upper networks

882
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:19,670
but think that maybe there could be a

883
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,620
few more and what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that</font>

884
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,720
there's probably a knowledge gap more

885
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">than anything else that there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

886
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,370
folks out there in the opportunity who

887
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,629
even the ones who use our<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas every day</font>

888
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:32,000
don't know that they can come help rake

889
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,590
them don't understand that they can come

890
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll and the process is and they</font>

891
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:38,540
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come participate so one of</font>

892
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,310
the first kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tangible outcomes from</font>

893
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,740
that survey is what we're calling the

894
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:44,930
IETF help desk I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the name may</font>

895
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,779
imply what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is provide</font>

896
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,370
a point a physical point of presence a

897
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,990
network operator group meetings around

898
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,600
the world where folks can come ask

899
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,770
questions what is this I ETF why would I

900
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,710
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate what are you working</font>

901
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,270
on and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can i participate so I wanted</font>

902
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,980
to kind of read back a little bit of

903
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:04,220
what we've seen so far we've done two of

904
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,620
them at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were at nanog 63</font>

905
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,709
in San Antonio<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not too far from</font>

906
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:11,420
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in early februari and that one was</font>

907
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,410
brought out at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called really</font>

908
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,110
successful

909
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">I also had a nice plenary spot first</font>

910
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,320
thing Monday morning to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

911
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,790
we were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this results of the</font>

912
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,110
survey I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that helped quite a bit</font>

913
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:26,000
and then the board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Betty there were</font>

914
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:28,250
kind enough to give us a spot kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

915
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,110
right outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plenary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hall so we</font>

916
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of traffic go by and we did</font>

917
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:35,510
talk to quite a few people many of whom

918
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,530
many of whom came up and said what is

919
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,690
the site yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> think how do I getting</font>

920
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,280
started where do I start<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said I had</font>

921
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">one gentleman came up and say I've been</font>

922
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,400
reading our seas for 15 years I had no

923
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:45,620
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know I could come help</font>

924
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,510
write them and I said many many people

925
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">who asked how do i start who's creating</font>

926
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,040
right right yeah you did over there but

927
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,290
didn't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they where they came</font>

928
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,290
from I guess that stork might have

929
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,790
dropped him off but that was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

930
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,020
and we also had several folks who were a

931
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,540
little more involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ITF come by</font>

932
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,470
and it kind of was again a point where

933
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,790
people could come talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

934
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,589
issues and we had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

935
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,330
conversations about folks who had ideas

936
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,730
on how we could get more operational and

937
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,770
put involved and again one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

938
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,570
we stressed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stressed speaking</font>

939
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,130
about this in Honolulu that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of</font>

940
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:17,360
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read back up is I keep saying</font>

941
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,640
operators and that's where we're focused

942
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,380
my focus in my work at the intersociety

943
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,549
is on operator outreach and kind of

944
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,110
pushing technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the</font>

945
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,700
operators but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think a lot of the</font>

946
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">lessons we're learning here could play</font>

947
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,960
and developer communities or the DevOps

948
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,070
world in particular and other things I

949
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,420
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what this is about is making</font>

950
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:35,270
it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come participate in the</font>

951
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:40,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF partially by making people know</font>

952
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:42,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can apricot 2015 was held in</font>

953
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,650
Fukuoka Japan like three weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

954
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:49,910
believe um I probably updates up there I

955
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:52,610
do not um about three weeks ago that was

956
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,859
I would say less successful arm mainly

957
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:56,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a little different form out</font>

958
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a meeting it's a much larger meeting</font>

959
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:01,820
as many meetings kind of push to put

960
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,379
together and they have a whole set of

961
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,720
sponsorship boots they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

962
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,590
trade show floor and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

963
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,149
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more of a community effort</font>

964
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,000
and be self-sustaining over the long run

965
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:13,250
we chose not to put in money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be a</font>

966
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,830
sponsor at a booth in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area which</font>

967
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,970
meant we kind of got stuck in down by

968
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,549
the registration desk which in a

969
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,750
four-story venue where all the meetings

970
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,120
were happening on the top three stories

971
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,160
being on the bottom floor didn't help

972
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,180
with traffic very much so we had less

973
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,240
folks come up and

974
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,830
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your new entry and the how do</font>

975
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">I get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started questions then we had at</font>

976
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,400
nanog but we still had several people

977
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,810
come up and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

978
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and how to make it better and</font>

979
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,410
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve things and it became it</font>

980
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,440
still was a good place to hang out and

981
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,779
have good conversations there wasn't a

982
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,840
plenary session either which again<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

983
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,130
have kind of lessened the knowledge of

984
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,140
people knowing that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk was</font>

985
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,070
even there but we did have a bar and

986
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,960
there was against some great

987
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,780
conversation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box as well with</font>

988
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,910
folks from the asia-pacific region

989
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,710
talking about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues and kind of</font>

990
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:03,109
reaffirming that what we got in the

991
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:05,450
survey was kind of a correct view of the

992
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:08,510
world which is that you know the the

993
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:09,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we saw in the survey are true and</font>

994
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,130
got every confirming that again so it's

995
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:15,200
good what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> next I'm actually leaving</font>

996
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,250
here to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to Dubai for the</font>

997
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,649
Middle East network operators group

998
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,080
meeting and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning on having a</font>

999
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,150
help desk there these<font color="#E5E5E5"> heels well that'll</font>

1000
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,759
still be worked out kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on site but</font>

1001
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:28,100
that should happen right 70<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1002
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,020
the word refused to be seen as too

1003
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,339
strong I what<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis going on there is</font>

1004
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,840
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a conversation in</font>

1005
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,900
Amsterdam about how to move this forward

1006
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:38,090
in the future they again are kind of in

1007
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,190
a situation where they have paid for

1008
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,600
sponsorship booths and they don't want

1009
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to set a precedent of just giving away</font>

1010
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,799
you know space in meeting for free so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1011
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,050
need to work out how this could happen

1012
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,340
going forward so there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1013
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation but there will not be a</font>

1014
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,270
desk set up at in Amsterdam but

1015
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,049
hopefully maybe in the future we'll have

1016
00:49:53,270 --> 00:50:00,110
one there from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there after after right</font>

1017
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:02,060
70 I'll be going to Bangladesh for the

1018
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">BT nog in Dhaka and we're gonna have a</font>

1019
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,620
help desk there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan</font>

1020
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">August kind of seen this as a win-win</font>

1021
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,460
and so will continue doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I actually</font>

1022
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,169
left one of the ITF helped us banners

1023
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,060
with them and so this will kind of

1024
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,530
hopefully keep going we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to</font>

1025
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,420
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it volunteers to stop the</font>

1026
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,640
desk at future meetings san Francisco's

1027
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,690
the next one in June I put a couple of

1028
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,879
the meetings here that are coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1029
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,070
really again you know the hope is that

1030
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,020
this spreads and is if it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1031
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this spreads and happens at nogs</font>

1032
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,400
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> offs all over the world so if you or</font>

1033
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,650
someone you know a colleague is

1034
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,660
attending one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it looks</font>

1035
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">good add to the list we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can help we can</font>

1036
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,970
ship you out ietf journals and a banner

1037
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,350
and help with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logistics of</font>

1038
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,899
coordinating with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting planner</font>

1039
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:45,520
and get these set up so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1040
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,800
limited to me flying around the world

1041
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,910
hopefully because I can't do any more of

1042
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I REM and hopefully can do a</font>

1043
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:53,500
little less we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see</font>

1044
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know folks who go to both the IETF</font>

1045
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,940
and an operator meeting helping out with

1046
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:01,450
this effort so you know there is also

1047
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:03,040
there's a synergy mailing list which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1048
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,020
basically to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these efforts</font>

1049
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,410
and coordinating that so if you want to

1050
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">join the list that'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good as well in</font>

1051
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the help desk itself there's</font>

1052
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,200
also some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kind of semi tangible</font>

1053
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,439
things that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out of all of this</font>

1054
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,899
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the ideas it keeps</font>

1055
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming back up and that I'd like to see</font>

1056
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,690
happen so I'm just kind of seeding this

1057
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,430
idea is providing ITF updates at nog and

1058
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,230
other meetings again developer or their

1059
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,520
conferences might be interesting where

1060
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,930
you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say hey this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

1061
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,060
ITF is because we're working on right

1062
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:36,100
now here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you get involved I'm</font>

1063
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:38,380
actually working within the icing into

1064
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,880
society to develop a slide deck that

1065
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,050
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of covers those points they will</font>

1066
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably make publicly available so if</font>

1067
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,410
other people want to do it will have

1068
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,900
speaking notes and slides and you can

1069
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,520
just grab the deck and go forth and get

1070
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,290
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the agenda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for 10 or 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes one</font>

1071
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these meetings and do that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1072
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that probably really good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because again</font>

1073
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,220
I think one of the base problems here is

1074
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,569
awareness ITF promote hubs is another

1075
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,160
idea that pops back up every now and

1076
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,390
then I know the folks in Latin America

1077
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,299
there's a group that are doing this

1078
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:06,069
already and that idea seems to be a good

1079
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,630
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that may work in other</font>

1080
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,490
regions of the world where you know

1081
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,950
folks can't all come to the ITF meeting

1082
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:13,359
obviously for cost reasons and also you

1083
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,710
know we I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that necessarily an</font>

1084
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,830
ITF of 10,000 people would be a good

1085
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:20,040
thing in any case so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know having</font>

1086
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:22,960
people go to listen in in you know areas

1087
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,170
especially places in Latin America maybe

1088
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,400
Africa Asia and the Pacific places in

1089
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,050
the world where connectivity isn't the

1090
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,380
greatest they may be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

1091
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">together and you know have hubs or your</font>

1092
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,540
kind of regional meetings where they

1093
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,710
listening on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF working groups and</font>

1094
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,060
have local conversations and local

1095
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,960
languages I don't know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1096
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,020
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1097
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,020
potentially we're working on a FAQ for

1098
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,740
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> folk there's already a lot of</font>

1099
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,180
interesting information out there for

1100
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,618
newcomers I have spent a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job</font>

1101
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,169
of building the newcomers page as a

1102
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:52,450
video there's a dau of the IETF the

1103
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:54,430
inner society built kind of a general

1104
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,960
frequently asked questions for kind of

1105
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,359
everyone and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build one</font>

1106
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,880
now from all that information specific

1107
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:04,180
to operators of again kind of how and

1108
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,190
why to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in the ITF I think</font>

1109
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as the ITF website redesign happens</font>

1110
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,290
over the next I don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

1111
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,390
that's going to take those things

1112
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually take a while but if we keep in</font>

1113
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,750
mind this idea of you know Laurine

1114
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,430
barrier to entry make it easier for

1115
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,650
newcomers to show up being operator and

1116
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,940
developer friendly so we can get back

1117
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know not just people who are</font>

1118
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,500
building boxes but people who are using

1119
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:25,420
boxes in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'd be good and then</font>

1120
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,010
also kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of back in mind thing for me</font>

1121
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,180
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> another project that work on at</font>

1122
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,859
the in our society which I think plays

1123
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this space is the best current</font>

1124
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:33,190
operational practices efforts that have

1125
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:34,750
sprung up all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and I think</font>

1126
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that might have a way of bringing</font>

1127
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,200
operators into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF folder least</font>

1128
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,089
making them more aware of what's going

1129
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,250
on here how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process works and may</font>

1130
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:45,310
help to again get that kind of

1131
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:48,880
operational check on I'm standards and

1132
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:51,520
protocols as<font color="#CCCCCC"> are being built out and I</font>

1133
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">think yep that is it so I would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

1134
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any questions comments or you</font>

know further discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one of</font>

1138
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,380
we really want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an ongoing</font>

00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:04,720
conversation of improvement Brian

1141
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,399
that he had you team today sort of

1142
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:12,940
invented a new initiative at the

1143
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:17,589
initiative<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yari that we should start</font>

1144
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:19,839
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically short videos of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1145
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:21,630
that and the other around the ITF you

1146
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,670
know rather than relying on traditional

1147
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:27,369
long slide decks and documents for

1148
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,230
everything and in fact by happy

1149
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:34,480
coincidence i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Benoit is going to</font>

1150
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:36,700
be the star of the prototype because

1151
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,480
they were already planning such a video

1152
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:41,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the yang space and I think that needs</font>

1153
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,119
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> coordinated with what you're</font>

1154
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about because if we do those</font>

1155
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,250
videos right there would be wonderful

1156
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:51,569
material to you know to provide two

1157

the first message that I could actually

1164

read because it was the first one in

enterprise network administrators use

1171
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:27,288
some of the same tools and aren't even

1172

00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:08,050
there they are other data channel data

extend their scenario folder for the

and during that session establishment

1233
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">SMA may provide the SSID and then the</font>

corresponding AR IP address to the wtp

1235
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:13,060
after that after the session

1236
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:15,460
establishment then the wtp will

1237
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:19,140
establish the data channel

1240
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have the address and then the channel</font>

1242
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:38,590
we here in this in the multiple

1243
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:44,040
operating scenario we will have have the

1244
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:50,530
three channels between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wtp and Jos</font>

1245
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:54,190
so in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat we propose to to AR</font>

1246
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:57,610
probe we all shall provide the SSID and

1247
00:59:54,190 --> 01:00:02,020
they are associated information to the

1248
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:04,780
wtp then the TT we can establish a nose

1249
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:07,240
with with different accessory<font color="#E5E5E5"> alters</font>

1250
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:15,880
these accessory alters belong to

1251
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:19,450
different we and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next actually</font>

1252
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:22,300
here it's a very minor change to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1253
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:27,310
current to left because for the current

1254
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:30,340
draft only when one SSID<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the air</font>

1255
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:32,680
address and then we extended the

1256
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:36,730
scenario to the multiple operators in

1257
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:39,850
rville so<font color="#CCCCCC"> their only changes that we we</font>

1258
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:43,980
propose to that the AC wheel will

1259
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:47,110
provide the air and sssaid associated

1260
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,980
information to the wtp then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> double</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">TP to use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information to</font>

1262
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:56,640
exceptional channels with different art

1263
01:00:52,810 --> 01:01:04,750
is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> as belong to different</font>

1264
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:07,660
operators ok next please as just

1265
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:11,050
discussed that this the current draft

1266
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:15,549
has already support further data under

1267
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the control on can control panel they</font>

1268
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:22,660
are separated<font color="#E5E5E5"> under then the will TT</font>

1269
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:28,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">will have the access router IP address</font>

1270
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:32,420
and this draft is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> the change we had</font>

1271
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:38,180
that to provide the multiple ssids and

1272
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:40,640
IP address I IPO judges though we think

1273
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:43,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's a very minor change to the</font>

1274
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:47,810
currently draft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hear i want to ask</font>

1275
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,760
them for the comments and shall we merge

1276
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:54,650
with the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft or go</font>

1277
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:57,050
separately<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually had a thing on</font>

1278
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:59,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cap web old</font>

1279
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:01,970
tunnel draft has finished working group

1280
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,260
last call and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think went through IETF</font>

1281
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:08,270
last call as well but it does seem to me

1282
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:11,720
at least as though this should be part

1283
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:14,090
of it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite know what the</font>

1284
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">process is i'm assuming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could sort of</font>

1285
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:19,910
pull it back from that and yeah we can

1286
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:22,910
say Drad you know we asked you to

1287
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:26,089
publish it will please don't and merge

1288
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:27,620
it or maybe it could finish the process

1289
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:33,830
and we could immediately do a best which

1290
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:39,020
seems incredibly silly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like help</font>

1291
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:41,950
abort and do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any authors of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1292
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:45,350
current draft of the OP tunnel draft and

1293
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:48,970
in the room and do they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any reason</font>

1294
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,970
why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't merge this into that</font>

1295
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:58,440
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's kind of up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you if</font>

1296
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:01,620
you think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one is essentially</font>

1297
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,600
completed by this or incomplete due to

1298
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:06,270
the absence of this or some variation

1299
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:12,720
thereof like you know we could claw this

1300
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:23,430
back I suppose but yeah I mean think

1301
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:26,580
about that carefully yeah I choked with

1302
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:33,930
xerosis and he also asked us a comment

1303
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:35,970
severe on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting quickly antiquity</font>

1304
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:37,890
trying to remember where in the status

1305
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:45,209
that is so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as my machine</font>

1306
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:49,740
connects I think I think Benoit was ship

1307
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:51,840
it was the ad yeah what's a bit it for

1308
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:55,319
publication yeah it's actually on the

1309
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">isg agenda for like a week or two from</font>

1310
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,910
now I believe because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Ben was</font>

1311
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:02,690
going skiing and therefore I get to

1312
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:09,440
represent it or something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amore</font>

1313
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:14,130
so it's pretty pretty soon yeah yeah um

1314
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">no no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scroll up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1315
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:22,680
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah at the history tab</font>

1316
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:29,580
yes would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice if oh they would go</font>

1317
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:31,350
that might help yeah yeah so that's been

1318
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:37,680
reviewed at least once already because

1319
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:39,779
it was an ad<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow-up yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would i</font>

1320
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">would probably not claw that one back if</font>

1321
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:46,950
you have unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a real desire</font>

1322
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:49,230
to do so um I mean if you do well then

1323
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:54,910
if this is important enough then by all

1324
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:57,430
means do it maybe this is a

1325
01:04:54,910 --> 01:05:00,160
I think we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a discussion with</font>

1326
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:02,109
the authors of the current document

1327
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,859
because it does sound like a pretty good

1328
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:09,640
thing to to consider merging them even

1329
01:05:05,859 --> 01:05:14,770
if its present procedurally inconvenient

1330
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:17,589
the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do what you have to I</font>

1331
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:19,660
mean that's and I'll support whatever

1332
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:24,549
decision you make but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll double your</font>
