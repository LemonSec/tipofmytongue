00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,850
elliptic comic<font color="#E5E5E5"> man or input from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

2
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:28,100
larger community so I would encourage

3
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,100
people to use that as well up there look

4
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:39,449
yes when it becomes a draft so basically

5
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,639
there's a section of that wiki that

6
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,160
tracks both working group gang models

7
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,920
and individual unique models there's two

8
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,769
tables there is a separate section that

9
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,860
lets people go on and announced their

10
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:55,290
intent or desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create a gang model</font>

11
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,430
and solicit input from the community so

12
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,800
I would encourage everybody to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

13
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it and use it as much as you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any other questions or comments</font>

people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room 15 years to the to</font>

31
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:46,500
the day actually well did it to the

32
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:50,699
meeting there we go about 15 years ago

33
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:56,710
that's what we first introduced the LFC

34
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,300
4447 which was the time called it was

35
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,370
still called civilized oh we haven't

36
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,839
actually we didn't give a cop's at one

37
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:06,340
at a time was called<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock martini</font>

38
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:10,210
actually and and then we we created a

39
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:15,130
working group called sea oats and that

40
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:17,620
then was renamed to pwe<font color="#CCCCCC"> three and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

41
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,630
guess he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a name to pals now and</font>

42
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,110
that's when I first actually I met

43
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stewart shortly after that on a big</font>

44
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:30,310
argument about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bits the feckin embed</font>

45
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,830
that can bit exactly actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

46
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably say what happened then at this</font>

47
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,220
point it's been 15 years there was a

48
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:43,150
typo<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in the in the header and so we</font>

49
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:47,140
basically reverse the effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on him back</font>

50
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">in bits in the pw free header they</font>

51
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,580
control word and that call you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

52
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,700
was no reason the particular reason and

53
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,590
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stewart actually found that</font>

54
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,210
tenancy he was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascii also questioned</font>

55
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,710
why do you would you reverse this bit

56
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,020
that we couldn't quite explain it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

57
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the problem is that there was a typo</font>

58
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> header but the problem is as soon</font>

59
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,420
as nobody notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> a type of document and</font>

60
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,070
by the time Stewart product the problem

61
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,880
everybody had implemented it that way

62
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:20,740
already so there was no has no good

63
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,110
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change it anyway so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

64
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,850
this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I did in in in the</font>

65
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,840
past there's been to two revisions

66
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:32,890
actually of this RFC 4447<font color="#CCCCCC"> biss the first</font>

67
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:35,830
one I took all the rat as we over the

68
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,810
past 15 years and you know they were

69
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,920
accepted there was a lot you know many

70
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:44,170
small technical problems mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and</font>

71
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,660
you know clarifications and things of

72
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:50,819
that and I included that in the document

73
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:55,120
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just took an overpass at it</font>

74
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,830
and we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

75
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,340
it's this talking has been around for a

76
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:03,340
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we just wanted to get a</font>

77
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,530
refresh to include the errata and a

78
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,670
movie to proposed standards or whatever

79
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next step is we I believe that right</font>

80
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">now it's it's ready for you know it's</font>

81
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,800
last call we're not trying to include

82
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,360
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted to do in</font>

83
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,849
this document I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

84
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything radically like text or or</font>

85
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,710
include over references to what has been

86
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put after the document or anything</font>

87
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,350
like that it's just a very simple fix

88
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,970
for for the errata and and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know kind</font>

89
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> update to the current temp later like</font>

90
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,030
EF so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's one thing</font>

91
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:49,080
they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on the list there was the</font>

92
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:52,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">order of the effect 129 theories and the</font>

93
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,540
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was there was there's one</font>

94
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,460
implementation that sends it in the

95
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,230
order that is in the picture in the

96
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft and there's a number of limitation</font>

97
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,720
ascendant in a random order and the

98
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,730
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> document does not require any</font>

99
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,589
order

100
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,630
you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to be</font>

101
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,399
norther there is a way FTL these is

102
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,410
opposed because you should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

103
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,959
send them in any order you want unless

104
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,750
somebody specifically says there is a

105
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,900
good reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send in a specific order</font>

106
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:25,089
and so so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel like we</font>

107
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,100
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a piece of text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that says</font>

108
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,809
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can send in any order</font>

109
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,668
because that's implied it doesn't say

110
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send it in order so we</font>

111
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:36,280
should be fine with that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

112
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,870
comments yeah clarifying question in a

113
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,770
router that you looked at the fixed in

114
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,000
next release a router as well as the

115
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,429
there are several classifications for a

116
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,740
rattle is reject there's accept which

117
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:50,740
obviously you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do have to do but there's</font>

118
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,169
also authors to look at when the

119
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,960
document is update updated did you pick

120
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">those up as well yes I looked at all of</font>

121
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,850
those there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were some that</font>

122
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,710
were not you only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at them</font>

123
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,360
but the commitment is that we were is

124
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the authors will look at the ones</font>

125
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,809
that the 80s classified as look at in

126
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,429
next release as well as the ones that

127
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">were pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I went through</font>

128
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,110
all the full errata they weren't

129
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,419
accepted there was nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there</font>

130
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,159
not accept I don't know they accepted

131
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,540
state I'm not sure who's making sure

132
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a lot of people don't well you</font>

133
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,940
know no no no it was it was the state

134
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,220
was always held for next that's a yes

135
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">look I did all of the held for next</font>

136
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:34,570
revision good good there was nothing

137
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was not you know there was wrong or</font>

138
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,379
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that I can remember it was</font>

139
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:41,830
it was fine now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

140
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go through all of the updated by</font>

141
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,909
documents and see if any of that needed

142
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:54,159
to be propagated into it updated by well

143
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:56,410
so rfcs get updated my other rfcs when

144
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,140
you do a revision you should look at

145
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,820
those updates and move them into the

146
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,700
main body of the text by one way or

147
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,770
another so that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise the</font>

148
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,990
update trail is lost and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

149
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:12,160
necessarily know what edits they need to

150
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:16,390
make right that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there was</font>

151
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,119
a there was no update to it was ok so

152
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,659
there's the one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to mind</font>

153
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:26,158
is there will control world negotiation

154
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:28,889
yes a pact where it was not as clearly

155
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,499
as specified in this particular graph as

156
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:41,639
it was in the next there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

157
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:43,949
of see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 2,000 Andy so no this is</font>

158
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,389
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> let me get back you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read about</font>

159
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tracker you can't have the tracker</font>

160
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,668
that says whether it was updated by

161
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:57,299
anything let's not do yeah that's not

162
00:19:50,669 --> 00:20:02,789
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one no that's not the last one</font>

163
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:05,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">a 21 right you see the update in this</font>

164
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:08,849
there you should incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those</font>

165
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:11,099
updates into the body of the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

166
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:12,569
I'd either directly or by reference or

167
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,849
ever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise all</font>

168
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:16,678
that information is lost and people

169
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:19,589
don't know everyone is we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

170
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference on this I'm not doing klein</font>

171
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:24,029
into putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this into text because some</font>

172
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,369
of those are fairly extensive well we'll

173
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:29,059
have to just look and see on a

174
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:31,458
case-by-case basis otherwise the

175
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:36,749
integrity of the document isn't right

176
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:38,849
okay I mean okay so so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me ask you a</font>

177
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:40,469
question here of them what does out of

178
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:45,029
season learning about which number it is

179
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:47,879
is the VCC be sorry the control protocol

180
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:50,759
negotiation which really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of updates</font>

181
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:52,708
whole session which we can include<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

182
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,659
updates and obsolete that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> see with</font>

183
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,829
the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that will come out I think</font>

184
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:59,249
that's probably the right thing to do

185
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:02,039
because that's just you know it's breezy

186
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:04,109
to do I just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put it that texting</font>

187
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,359
there was not intention initially whom

188
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:08,908
this document because we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

189
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,999
change you know why don't you do that

190
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got to say that delete the</font>

191
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,839
paragraph delete the section or we have

192
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:18,418
delete delete body the section and say

193
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,208
the method of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this is described in</font>

194
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:23,879
RFC whatever yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but here's the</font>

195
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:25,169
problem is this document is is well

196
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:27,149
established the procedure in these

197
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents will establish this is ready</font>

198
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:31,379
for you know proposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard or</font>

199
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,939
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> trac right those are have</font>

200
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:34,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">ceased</font>

201
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,360
they updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the control world</font>

202
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:41,330
updates and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not exactly</font>

203
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same status so we need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

204
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,309
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one on a case-by-case basis and see</font>

205
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,230
because that line will not be that line

206
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,120
of updates will not be present in the

207
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,440
new RFC right right right okay so we

208
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,500
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that the reader of the</font>

209
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,240
new RFC Rosa where by reading that

210
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,389
document or reading another document of

211
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,000
the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presented in the update</font>

212
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:04,428
text<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so okay but this still</font>

213
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,740
gives me a dilemma because you did the

214
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,259
control board negotiation procedure that

215
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,409
this is describing that is not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

216
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:14,539
document right and it is not the same

217
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:17,809
status level of implementation or

218
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,730
anywhere than it is in in this

219
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:21,259
particular in fact I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

220
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,320
may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> any implementations of that</font>

221
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:26,149
that on what is in this document so i

222
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,580
can't really include that text in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

223
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:30,350
document and claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is we we</font>

224
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,090
did with moving should look at the top

225
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,178
line but we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with the</font>

226
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,730
updates as well as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arab sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

227
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:40,509
we'll deal with that just we need to

228
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,370
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to best you know I</font>

229
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,320
referencing them maybe or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

230
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,168
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we don't we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font>

231
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,689
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that causes the document to</font>

232
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:58,070
linger<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet them over and over 10 or 15</font>

233
00:22:50,690 --> 00:23:01,340
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so any any other points</font>

234
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:05,658
another updated points<font color="#E5E5E5"> has anything else</font>

235
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:07,100
anybody wants to bring up i vas word for

236
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,769
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes because usually we don't</font>

237
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,379
have enough time and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

238
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:13,850
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conclusion and discussion to to</font>

239
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:16,789
move this forward we have all the time

240
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the world today sorry we pirate we're</font>

241
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,179
going to hijack another hour hour and a

242
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,000
half or something rather the end of this

243
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:27,409
year we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have lots of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah exactly</font>

244
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eric yeah I one comment on me Eric gray</font>

245
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:32,299
at ericsson<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have one comment on the</font>

246
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:35,959
the thing you were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

247
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,309
the order of the tles or and and it

248
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,629
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's sort of a proof</font>

249
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:39,670
of concept that there's some confusion

250
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:42,429
over this

251
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,710
and it you could you could argue that

252
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,470
because we don't say it has to be in

253
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,170
this order right we are implying that it

254
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,000
can be in any order but it's equally

255
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,800
true that if it's shown in a specific

256
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,170
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's implied that that's the older</font>

257
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,940
you might be consp ecting it and so I

258
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:02,440
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful to put in it</font>

259
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:05,260
these these may appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any order in</font>

260
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,170
the document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other point you're</font>

261
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,460
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the updates I</font>

262
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,800
completely agree with chairs on that I

263
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,630
mean minimally after all things are

264
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,129
considered you have to at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

265
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,980
paragraph in there and says you know

266
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,440
please also review the following rfcs

267
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:24,550
which have updated this that's sure yeah

268
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about to order they come and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

269
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,810
have is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that earlier in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft there</font>

270
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,490
is actually a set of TL VZ with the

271
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,290
picture that has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order and it</font>

272
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:36,120
says this has to be in the order it

273
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:38,680
explicitly says that so the rest I mean

274
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,199
people yes can assume the next one has

275
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:44,770
to be in order or not I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's kind</font>

276
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,290
of a clarification point we can you know

277
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,750
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add some</font>

278
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:52,149
text I i we could add a text that says

279
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,530
did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this don't necessarily have</font>

280
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,010
to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order or something like that</font>

281
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,389
but as you know the interpretation is

282
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,400
that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in order and the</font>

283
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,980
text doesn't say in that section it has

284
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,810
to be in order so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

285
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">extremely useful clarification because</font>

286
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,379
one of the things that people tend to

287
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,320
forget is the one you have a make in an

288
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,480
RFC there's an implicit must behind that

289
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,100
which is that you say it may appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

290
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,620
any order that means somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font>

291
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,620
accept it in anywhere right right so

292
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:30,920
any more comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great any more</font>

293
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:34,340
questions or comments felucca<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

294
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:42,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucas let me put the next</font>

295
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation up that is yes it is</font>

296
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:21,190
just move it a little bit to the left

297
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:25,960
this that's fine thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay lowa could</font>

298
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:28,120
you use electro so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a directive</font>

299
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">what your name please and lo Anderson</font>

300
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,790
that is it directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the secretariat</font>

301
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,490
that you should make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speakers keep</font>

302
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:39,760
within the box on the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

303
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:44,970
there is a camera that it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

304
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:48,250
running so please Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Louis though</font>

305
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:52,450
if you come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please stand in</font>

306
00:26:48,250 --> 00:27:00,220
the pink box pink box here and remember

307
00:26:52,450 --> 00:27:01,660
that very well does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm</font>

308
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,090
going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac withdraw</font>

309
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:10,060
signaling these are the co-authors so

310
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:13,810
brief history we started with this

311
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,929
effort was started in 2011 and it was

312
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,610
first presented in l2vpn then it went

313
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:22,230
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit dormant there wasn't</font>

314
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,879
sufficient interest in the l2vpn group

315
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,080
the service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> were requesting</font>

316
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:33,100
this feature so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and</font>

317
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,280
presented in pw III in pw3 we went

318
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:40,659
pretty far discussions and there was a

319
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:44,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of acceptance and all that in 88 ITF</font>

320
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:47,770
88 we did a detail protocol presentation

321
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,399
and was well received but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

322
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost towards the end there was a I</font>

323
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,020
think the chairs ND malice and other

324
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,040
people suggested that we should really

325
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">take it to l2vpn working group so again</font>

326
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,720
we took it back to l2vpn working group

327
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,939
because original mac withdraw signaling

328
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,450
for dynamic pseudowire were actually

329
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,090
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2vpn working group so we took</font>

330
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to l2vpn working group since already</font>

331
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:21,189
in the last stages in pw3 we did allah

332
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:24,459
call and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the group split we</font>

333
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:27,210
had some more comments and so we are

334
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:33,309
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an update on with the comments</font>

335
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:35,290
next slide please so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the as we as you</font>

336
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:39,309
guys know Mac withdraw signaling is

337
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:42,370
actually it's an optimization to

338
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:44,379
mitigate the black holes during pseudo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

339
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:48,549
switch over it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

340
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:51,640
dynamic slower as I said this is this is

341
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:54,610
to do it over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the static pseudo wires so</font>

342
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,210
this this mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is clone</font>

343
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:00,699
from the dynamic match because signaling

344
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:04,020
for which is already defined in the 4762

345
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:08,230
and pseudo as status signaling was

346
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:10,418
actually taken from the pseudo I status

347
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,880
signaling actually shows how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

348
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:15,309
the status TV or any kind of signaling

349
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,049
on the OEM channels so we took<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

350
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:24,820
scheme from there so yeah here is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

351
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:29,290
brief graphical display on where it is

352
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:31,750
used a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of animation here you</font>

353
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:34,120
want to click<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so if you have a</font>

354
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,090
fault if it's empty you is dual home to

355
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:41,770
p1 and p2 and if the primary pseudowire

356
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:46,360
is on going to the p1 and you if you had

357
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:48,429
a fault you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mech you need to the</font>

358
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,270
empty use which is over to the standby

359
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:54,970
pseudowire and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> click and since this</font>

360
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a static sort of wire you need to do</font>

361
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:01,600
a signaling of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac we draw one more</font>

362
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:03,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">click and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how it progresses</font>

363
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,350
MTU sends the mac withdraw signal over

364
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,250
the static pseudowire has described in

365
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:12,850
this draft which then gets propagated to

366
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:16,570
all of the remote pease the whole idea

367
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:19,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is to so that yeah the whole idea</font>

368
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:24,428
there is that all those remote p is p 6

369
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:27,610
5 4 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 who were sending the traffic for</font>

370
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:29,890
stations behind the MTU they were they

371
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,889
those remote piece did not know anything

372
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:35,740
about the pseudowire going down on<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

373
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:38,410
between mt u and P 1 so they were they

374
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,120
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned the MAC addresses that sent</font>

375
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,390
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending the traffic to the PE</font>

376
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:47,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">one so they would continue to send</font>

377
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,900
traffic to<font color="#E5E5E5"> p1 we want now to let them</font>

378
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that now that you can send the</font>

379
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:56,530
traffic for two for them to you through

380
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,620
the PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 so you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send this Mac</font>

381
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:06,070
withdraw that's the utility of this

382
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:09,610
feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that the Wi-Fi on the</font>

383
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:14,470
static pseudowire so the this mpls-tp

384
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:17,439
you know as is taking hold especially in

385
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:21,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> access networks and thats a static</font>

386
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,929
provisioning LSPs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's doubt tails</font>

387
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,419
with the static provisioning of the

388
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:29,400
pseudo wires so this nessa see it's this

389
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">om signaling for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the statics of the wire</font>

390
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,929
next so the coming back to the central

391
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:40,929
topic here the response to the comments

392
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:42,700
the you know these comments were quite

393
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:47,290
comprehensive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart provided those</font>

394
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,850
who Thank You Stuart so that I have not

395
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,520
addressed all the comments but I had

396
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:55,409
taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most of the the general bigger</font>

397
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:59,679
comments the first concern was that

398
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:01,780
magnet rho signaling on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp was actually</font>

399
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,540
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp uses the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp so there's a</font>

400
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,440
guaranteed delivery reliable

401
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:11,649
acknowledged in order and this one since

402
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,080
this is not using<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp it says it's over</font>

403
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:18,190
the static pseudowire so how do you

404
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,439
guarantee the delivery and so the the

405
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,840
comet is correct we do have the sequence

406
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,830
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgment and three retries</font>

407
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,860
so it's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a best-effort scheme</font>

408
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:32,830
it is true that yes you can if the

409
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,668
network is congested or lossy you can

410
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,249
lose that and

411
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:39,470
and you may not you may not get the mac

412
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:41,149
video signal so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

413
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the new text says but does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

414
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:46,039
explain clearly to reviewers that it is

415
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,869
a best-effort scheme because yes the

416
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:49,940
dangerous this<font color="#E5E5E5"> question will get raised</font>

417
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:52,970
yes three other times between now and

418
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,070
IRS<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> added a paragraph because</font>

419
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:58,070
you made that comment i said yes i will

420
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:00,850
and i added yeah i made it very very

421
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:05,090
clear that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a best-effort scheme</font>

422
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:07,998
it's an optimization scheme and there

423
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:11,389
are others other mechanisms by which the

424
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:14,119
node will relearn so if you have a

425
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:17,689
bidirectional unicast frame exchange

426
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,999
going on then you will learn and the

427
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:23,809
second is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the aging timer</font>

428
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:25,100
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> share on the very so a question</font>

429
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,850
what's the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> within this and</font>

430
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,529
this RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 73 61 and also there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an EVP</font>

431
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:35,209
nmac withdrawal also what's the

432
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:39,559
difference with that one so the IRA 7361

433
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:44,350
is an optimization the opted for the in

434
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:46,940
the 73 61 that the scheme there is that

435
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:52,939
if you if we go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous</font>

436
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:55,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">badger that graph here the in 73 61 says</font>

437
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:58,220
that the p1 should send the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac we draw</font>

438
00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:00,918
oh yeah instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P to send</font>

439
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,739
Omega door to every the p1 sends the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font>

440
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,230
we draw with a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of mac</font>

441
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:09,109
addresses so that you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

442
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">flush all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses from the</font>

443
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:13,879
other but here you flush everything yeah

444
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,940
so this one this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 444 I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

445
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,368
map withdraw signaling or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know 4762</font>

446
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,200
this is what it says that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it on</font>

447
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:24,109
the stair then the one you just

448
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,629
activated so that's the difference and

449
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:30,440
then if you can also had some mic with

450
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:32,509
Rob I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is or</font>

451
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,960
anything different they're there you

452
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:38,419
know bgp based mac video signaling yeah

453
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,940
EVP n is bgp ways yeah and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LT</font>

454
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:43,790
today this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is al dpa no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is static</font>

455
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,899
static on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way not even earlier no</font>

456
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,909
not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp but your drug says LD fever</font>

457
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,549
started League inning no no the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

458
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,760
scheme is derived the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we draw</font>

461
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:02,500
withdrawal we didn't define a new tlv

462
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but this is done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the static</font>

463
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,900
pseudowire on in band om channel so we

464
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:11,020
in band om shan so you're defining in

465
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,680
you oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah new ACH type yeah yeah</font>

466
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,720
yes it's not it's in the traffickers

467
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,220
yeah and actually the last lectures we

468
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,910
are asking for new<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM channel type you</font>

469
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">see school I should make that clear do</font>

470
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,930
well there well you know it says the

471
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:35,589
static over static pseudowire there is

472
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:39,490
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp in bed yes yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the couple</font>

473
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:42,069
of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yes so you know the general</font>

474
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,529
scheme is that you will relearn with the

475
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:47,470
you know bi-directional uniform unicast

476
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:49,210
for him exchange and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

477
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:54,038
the mac address aging usually the

478
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:55,420
default time is 300 seconds so if you

479
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,309
know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> verse trick worst case</font>

480
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,170
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have a black hole in</font>

481
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:05,500
45 minutes another point is that you

482
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to actually keep retrying</font>

483
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,859
forever because the utility are the

484
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:14,440
benefits of mac withdraw signaling to

485
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:17,109
flush<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac addresses the case you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know as</font>

486
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,299
the time goes by so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's it's a</font>

487
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:24,220
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small window you want to do the</font>

488
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:28,299
flush and you know carry on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

489
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:30,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide please so the other comment was</font>

490
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:32,829
you know what if you are using the big

491
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:35,380
mac and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if that list is too big</font>

492
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:37,390
there is no fragmentation and you know

493
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,250
how do you handle all that so you know

494
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the response is actually there are a</font>

495
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:44,470
couple of ways you can handle that one

496
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:48,250
is that it is a sequence number based so

497
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:50,609
you eat you can treat a concise you know

498
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:54,069
you can break up the list and you send

499
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:57,279
frame by frame with whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list it</font>

500
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:58,808
can accommodate in the MTU and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it</font>

501
00:36:57,279 --> 00:37:00,640
each one is individually that

502
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:03,130
individually with the sequence number

503
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,710
the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's too big</font>

504
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,809
you just use an empty metal it anyway so

505
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should share on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> body so how does</font>

506
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:13,390
the p2 now<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a failure on the</font>

507
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">other link the prairies a pseudo has</font>

508
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:19,269
started signaling also sospeter really

509
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,940
doesn't have to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font>

510
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:23,589
failure between MTU and PE 1 and then

511
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,349
why if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know then why she</font>

512
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:28,660
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a mac with raw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p2 doesn't ask</font>

513
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:32,440
for it empty you sends the mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> we draw</font>

514
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,779
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PE 2 and their PE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 then forwards</font>

515
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,490
that to everybody else so this packet

516
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:39,279
that is just showing is sent from the

517
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:43,089
MTU yeah that's from<font color="#CCCCCC"> theatre no not from</font>

518
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:45,250
p2 p2 forwards also the MTU so this or

519
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:48,609
why it starts from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mt you yes not from</font>

520
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:51,789
here to know empty you is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know thus</font>

521
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:54,880
the hierarchical vpls you right in the

522
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:57,400
hierarchy we pls you have the it's not a

523
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,789
multi-segment pseudowire this is in the

524
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:05,109
hierarchical vpls you know you have an

525
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:14,619
MTU that talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Pease and the peas</font>

526
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:17,799
it yeah so the empty you would send it

527
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:20,650
over the pseudo wise let's go back ok so

528
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:23,410
the MTU sends it over a pseudowire which

529
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:26,589
terminates at p2 yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly and then</font>

530
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:29,859
the p2 takes this message yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> puts it</font>

531
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">on another pseudowire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

532
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:34,480
the vpls instance yes same thing with

533
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:41,859
the pseudo our status signaling and all

534
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:43,779
that yeah yeah ok yeah so those you who

535
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:45,970
are standing in the back could you find

536
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">seats there are some open seats up here</font>

537
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,899
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep the door block</font>

538
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,359
yeah it's a great thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is uh this</font>

539
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:58,450
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very common yeah hey I can</font>

540
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:04,538
explain you more<font color="#CCCCCC"> offline if you want ok</font>

541
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:07,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the comments yeah so</font>

542
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:10,299
you handle the you know the MTU exit by

543
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,899
the empty list or break break down the

544
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:15,549
list

545
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:19,119
into multiple videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the second the</font>

546
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:21,220
next slide please yeah sorry there was a

547
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,980
yeah the concern is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you handle</font>

548
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,740
the out of order again this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

549
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:31,180
reliable delivery but we do have a

550
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:34,779
sequence numbers so what we have stated

551
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,848
in the draft is that if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a out</font>

552
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:39,849
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> order so if you have a lower sequence</font>

553
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:43,000
number arrive later than the higher

554
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:47,319
sequence number you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually ignore</font>

555
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,420
that and but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a kit so the highest</font>

556
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:52,150
sequence number takes the presidency so

557
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,940
now when that happens if you ignore that

558
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,490
list you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will you will not flush the</font>

559
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,220
subset of the MAC addresses which again

560
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,618
is fine because then you know if you did

561
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,410
the means those mac addresses they would

562
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:10,569
be relearned anyway by other mechanism

563
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:16,779
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not a calamity that you lost</font>

564
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:22,619
a subset of mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses next time the</font>

565
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:25,559
fixed three yeah we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three retries</font>

566
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,779
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can you go back I did not</font>

567
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:32,049
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the sequence number rap there</font>

568
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:36,309
is an RFC 4385 we do do sequence number

569
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:38,170
in the control word and this RFC 4385

570
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:41,079
actually describes how do you handle

571
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:44,619
that how do you detect a wrap and and

572
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:54,010
how do you handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the overflow so</font>

573
00:40:44,619 --> 00:41:00,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go to the next slide I ok so yes we</font>

574
00:40:54,010 --> 00:41:02,740
have 33 retries comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the fixed</font>

575
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:05,650
interval so the yeah the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

576
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,450
said that you know if you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

577
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,819
receive that if the sender doesn't

578
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,669
receive the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACK yeah you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

579
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:15,730
you resend after<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 second interval 3</font>

580
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:18,900
fixed intervals and the comment was that

581
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,030
you know in case of scaled configuration

582
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,920
you

583
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:25,010
there may be many<font color="#CCCCCC"> pseudo was doing this</font>

584
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,770
and you cannot guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everything</font>

585
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:31,340
so I think the better thing and I have

586
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:33,530
changed the text is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can do the</font>

587
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,420
exponential<font color="#CCCCCC"> back up it's an</font>

588
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:39,710
implementation choice but it's a

589
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:42,590
suggestion that if you were to that do

590
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,900
apply some jitter then you know you have

591
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:50,240
a better chance of resending it and

592
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:53,960
getting an act back next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide scene so</font>

593
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,000
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had the that was very</font>

594
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">good comments very comprehensive there</font>

595
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,100
was a lot of other comments also i want

596
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:07,580
to address them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all here but it made the</font>

597
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">truck better and i think we feel that we</font>

598
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it's now in a much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better shape so</font>

599
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,540
next slide please<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so I think you</font>

600
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we have asked for a new channel</font>

601
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:26,980
type x 28 and we feel that we should

602
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:29,600
give go for the last call again comments

603
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,520
yes I again two more question for I

604
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like the name OEM I think we</font>

605
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,200
should change it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to something else you</font>

606
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:38,270
call it OEM this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really OEM the</font>

607
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:42,620
pseudo I status also calls it over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

608
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:46,520
yeah yes it's consistent SRAM sorry it's

609
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:49,040
consistent with previous error yes it's

610
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:54,140
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rock debacles box if i compare</font>

611
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,060
our seas<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um if you feel strongly</font>

612
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,620
enough about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I suggest that you put</font>

613
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,770
your comment on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list in there and</font>

614
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,240
see if you get any positive reaction ok

615
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,940
this is really controlling us as you

616
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,939
know yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not doing any it will go</font>

617
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send a comment changer hail either be</font>

618
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,020
right before or during last call it will

619
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,330
be addressed according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> g</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process sure</font>

620
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,540
second thing is this only withdrawal or

621
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,910
is it chemically used to move the mac to

622
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:24,100
a different suit or no it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

623
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:26,690
withdraw its only coach yeah it would be

624
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of an imperfect</font>

625
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,369
solution intended to provide some

626
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,619
optimization if it was a movement it

627
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,839
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to show where to</font>

628
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:37,309
move to and all that stuff and and the

629
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,038
sender doesn't know where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should move</font>

630
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:43,309
to like for instance in this case then p

631
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,990
2 would have to know which sort of our

632
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:46,819
phase and what that should have our

633
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,308
coincides on the other remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pease</font>

634
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,799
right here this is just saying hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus</font>

635
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:54,319
this make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it unknown it will get</font>

636
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:56,779
broadcasted and it will relearn the one

637
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,940
the whole idea here is that don't keep

638
00:43:56,779 --> 00:44:00,440
sending it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old paths because all</font>

639
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">path has gone down you're not going to</font>

640
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,480
it not going to go so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

641
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:09,440
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you thank you</font>

642
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,799
macho and the the chairs are in

643
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,329
agreement that it's ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for last call</font>

644
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that will be starting soon after the</font>

645
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:25,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">ietf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had excellent and just before we</font>

646
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,220
move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next talk who has not yet</font>

647
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:30,559
signed the blue sheets I see some lot of

648
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,779
hands up so whoever has the blue sheets

649
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">please start them circulating again so</font>

650
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:41,140
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get them around to everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

651
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:08,879
alright so I am NOT Carlos or Prasad yep

652
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:19,750
yes oh ok ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> trafford early for those</font>

653
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,370
of you just for everybody's knowledge

654
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,680
for those of you who plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present in</font>

655
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:26,259
any working group in any room this week

656
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,419
there is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> muneco system that the</font>

657
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:34,450
IETF is now using in and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

658
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:36,840
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the rooms now to to broadcast</font>

659
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:39,100
what's happening in the IETF and and

660
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,670
recorded as well and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

661
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:45,160
camera in every room and by standing in

662
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,320
the pink box that's marked on the carpet

663
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,480
that guarantees that you're in the range

664
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,520
of the camera so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anyone who's</font>

665
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,560
watching out in the web or watching the

666
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,240
recording at some point in the future

667
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,340
can actually see who's speaking so

668
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,250
that's the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why there's a pink box</font>

669
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:04,300
on the carpet that's so now you all know

670
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:07,060
well that's all very well it's fortunate

671
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,190
that in this particular slot I don't

672
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,890
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do my usual thing of pointing at</font>

673
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,270
the slides and explaining one line or

674
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:16,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other was showing how packets are</font>

675
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,220
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around so we should pride some</font>

676
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,680
feedback about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this restraint on</font>

677
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,200
speakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the next slide please and</font>

678
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,899
I'm not either the and we and this was

679
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,640
presented in BFE yesterday next slide

680
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,640
please it should be moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me see</font>

681
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,640
hello

682
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:47,109
here we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so what not what this</font>

683
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:54,670
is about is about defining the behavior

684
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:58,259
of spfd on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cv channel for a</font>

685
00:46:54,670 --> 00:47:00,430
signaled and prostatic pseudo wires and

686
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,540
uncle slightly<font color="#CCCCCC"> unconventionally it</font>

687
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:12,129
covers both are the l2tp case as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

688
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:14,830
the over and mpls PSN case so 55 58 5

689
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:18,270
covers this but we don't very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often talk</font>

690
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:21,848
about it in this in this working group

691
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:24,339
so we're interested in l2tp signal

692
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:26,320
pseudo wires static pseudo wires and a

693
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:28,960
future revision of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

694
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">about ldp signaled suitor wires but it's</font>

695
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,950
not in the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the text</font>

696
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:37,210

697
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:39,549
protocol procedures of 5885 and to

698
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,800
define the additional the additional

699
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:47,500
work changes that are needed to support

700
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:52,390
spfd we will need a new cv we need new

701

703
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,259
discussion the last time this was

704
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:05,740
presented it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the records and the</font>

705
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:11,830
authors will take a look at the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> echo</font>

711
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:39,400
design as part of this is the the the

712
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:42,040
mechanism for getting the spfd

713
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,560
discriminators will either use

714
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,779
provisioned discriminators or use the

715
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:53,029
the alert mechanism that's currently

716
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:57,020
being proposed in the seamless PSD alert

717
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:59,150
draft and l2tp when that's used for

718
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:04,210
advertisements there is a draft that

719
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">describes how we add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lttp</font>

721
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:18,050
we can either send BFD natively or we

722
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:22,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">can send it in UDP IP where it's going</font>

be worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that because I would</font>

like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that every time two</font>

systems come up every time I provision

756
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,989
some systems the behavior is exactly as

757
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:16,690
I expect so I'm guessing we may end up

758
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:23,519
with all three cases one the other or

759
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:27,789
both Greg<font color="#E5E5E5"> moreschi Erickson actually I</font>

760
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:33,189
would compare SB of d to our icmp and

761
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:36,489
LSP pink so not really be of<font color="#CCCCCC"> D because</font>

762
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a functionality of echo request</font>

763
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:43,180
echo reply and that's more like I see in

764
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:44,859
peeping in LSP being right but we're

765
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:49,419
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to but the the two</font>

how they will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a common</font>

769
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:01,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement whether they are going to run</font>

771
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,640
spfd because they could decide that you

772
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:11,920
want to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> s50 all three possible cases</font>

773
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:14,519
exist right but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time when we</font>

advertising capability where advertising

776
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:31,788
and email sighs have a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

777
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:35,538
participant rather than as a chair my

778
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:37,609
own personal druthers is that we as a

779
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:41,029
working group just make a choice for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

780
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:43,660
being the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the three cases</font>

781
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:46,459
I don't key I don't have any particular

782
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinion as to which one should be the</font>

783
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:53,598
default but I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

784
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:55,569
default so that it's so if if people

785
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,669
just naively bring up systems without

786
00:52:55,569 --> 00:53:00,589
provisioning this it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> work yeah I</font>

787
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:02,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely agree that there needs to be</font>

788
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:05,739
one default but I suspect there are

789
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:09,529
really three cases and not to as people

790
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:11,900
have bought yes I have a question to the

791
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:16,329
previous slide where there's a reference

792
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:20,419
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CH encapsulation at previous slide</font>

793
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:26,329
so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a CH encapsulation ah</font>

794
00:53:20,419 --> 00:53:30,499
there is no IP address to return to so

795
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:36,229
how reflector will identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source</font>

796
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:39,439
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> s BFD echo request and return because</font>

797
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:42,439
the idea of SB FD is that reflector

798
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:44,779
doesn't create any state associated with

799
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:47,598
a session there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always suitable</font>

800
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:49,309
statement is unconditionally going to be

801
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,289
pseudowire state because pseudo wiser

802
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:57,679
was bi-directional so you all will know

803
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:59,539
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> your peter is ok so basically no you</font>

804
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,640
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I think you you can say that</font>

805
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:04,339
you always know that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

806
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,939
something of this type of this vfp of

807
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:09,828
spfd type on a pseudowire then you take

808
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:15,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">the appropriate actions and send them</font>

809
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:17,929
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the the the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us part of</font>

810
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:22,789
the pseudowire because sooner wise

811
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:24,650
always bidirectional great<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

812
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:26,719
quite sure what happens and maybe

813
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone maybe I've just forgotten what</font>

814
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,829
happens if you have a

815
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:32,119
point-to-multipoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudo why do you</font>

816
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:35,900
always have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a return channel there I</font>

817
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,159
really can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember no no so we do</font>

818
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,560
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out whether this is a</font>

819
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,670
flick

820
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,950
yeah 22 that case yeah the only thing

821
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know is that there's</font>

822
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,759
probably an AP return channel of this

823
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,680
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all you know well I don't</font>

824
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,020
know there may not be any in a.m. PST

825
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,790
PST or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that's true</font>

826
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,800
so we do need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some comment in</font>

827
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:59,330
here on that either limiting the

828
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:06,120
applicability or solving the problem yep

829
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:09,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide next slide so I think it</font>

830
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:11,180
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really useful if people can put</font>

831
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the comments that they've made</font>

832
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto the list we could if we can have a</font>

833
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,950
list discussion on this the authors are

834
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,870
keen to close off the open items and to

835
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:24,000
submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new revision and they're going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask for this to be adopted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

837
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,070
working group given the existence of

839
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:36,390
an opinion on it and don't need to

840
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:41,000
specify a solution for using that type

841
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:47,970
of OEM technology ok ok any questions

842
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:51,030
yep I'll opium from javi well question

no definition of an RSVP single suit or

851
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:19,589
is it knock knock one that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows so</font>

852
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,260
so I don't see why we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

853
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:25,260
discussion about RSVP here none are not

854
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:28,800
are asleep you are deep you our<font color="#CCCCCC"> old EP i</font>

855
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduce you yeah when not it so they plan</font>

856
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:37,110
to provide some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text i think if you go</font>

857
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:38,970
beyond earlier on in here yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah mpls</font>

858
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:41,910
ldp signal zeros are not considered in

859
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:44,609
this revision the bracket future<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

860
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:46,080
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mean that there will</font>

861
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:49,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">be an ldp</font>

862
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:52,710
body<font color="#CCCCCC"> of text written before this work is</font>

863
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">fully completed so we will need an ldp</font>

864
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:58,590
solution and hence you know my question

865
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:00,720
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we pick one if we're signal</font>

866
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:03,150
if we're negotiating this because if

867
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,129
you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp you will have to have</font>

868
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,600
the default negotiation mechanism

869
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,550
working so i think it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

870
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,319
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the text in rather than</font>

871
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,230
there's no intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it and I</font>

872
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:17,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have no no choice but to solve</font>

873
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:21,270
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute to document the design for</font>

874
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">use in an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ODP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signaled environment I'm</font>

875
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:30,180
sorry I misheard that you said I know

876
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:32,490
any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the very just a</font>

877
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">clarification question these runs over</font>

878
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:38,959
the l2tp has a control packet and data

879
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,270
package runs over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data package right</font>

880
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:46,410
another control so the signaling

881
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:51,720
configuration runs over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

882
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:55,200
plane and the identification that this

883
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:58,169
is an oam spfd itself runs on their data

884
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:01,350
there's a bit in the l2tp header<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

885
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:03,270
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l am ok so it has exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

886
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,319
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact same as their concept but</font>

887
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:09,920
they've just dodged it in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely</font>

888
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:14,220
different way<font color="#E5E5E5"> en w'en</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down from poway</font>

889
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:17,760
just a clarification is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a drop</font>

890
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:22,109
litter<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose is to replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

891
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:29,240
original easily at the FD no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

892
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:34,650
think so I mean BF BFD exists anyway and

893
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:37,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can't see as ever deprecating it in</font>

894
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:43,280
any immediate term<font color="#E5E5E5"> done time frame so</font>

895
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:48,720
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enhance BFD but i am</font>

896
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:51,150
presumably when you want to introduce

897
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,339
some measure of scaling that you might

898
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:56,640
not easily achieve with BF diva BFD has

899
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,710
got some useful properties anyway yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

900
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree</font>

901
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I said about the sense that it can</font>

902
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:11,690
also be used to empieza to the wire so I

903
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:17,299
think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have a two options</font>

904
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:21,140
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PFD VCC be so which should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

905
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:23,810
use sorry i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure but he wants to</font>

906
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">know this me two options yeah the in</font>

907
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:33,830
spfd he's looking for guidelines I think

908
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:38,180
it depends on what you're trying to to

909
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:40,250
achieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his point is</font>

910
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,830
if the draft should go into oh right the

911
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,960
draft should discuss under what

912
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:47,750
circumstance yes that yeah that the

913
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:52,130
applicability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work would be a</font>

914
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:55,490
useful section to act yes I yes exactly

915
00:59:52,130 --> 01:00:04,460
here ha totally like every booster I

916
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:05,598
supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in some crap equipment so</font>

917
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is I don't know the answer</font>

918
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,880
that question but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the author's</font>

919
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:13,450
where shouldn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a or b and they</font>

920
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:17,780

921
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:20,450
and I didn't pursue it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they</font>

924
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:28,960
running in the same mode a B<font color="#E5E5E5"> or am to be</font>

931
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:25,440
that used to discuss the design for our

932
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:27,690
two week in a young model<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I see a</font>

configuration a model in the past

937
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:44,789
working group then after the meeting we

938
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:48,329
received a positive response from the

939
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:52,859
several experts to cooperation to define

940

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we have a meeting to discuss the</font>

946
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:15,450
design for the earth who we being young

947

959
01:02:53,759 --> 01:03:00,479
the arrow to VPN because in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> are to review the very popular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

961
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:07,379
the all kinds of our VPN solution have

962
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:10,859
been proposed here so this goal we try

963
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:12,960
to define that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to design by this</font>

964
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:15,348
team and the water not<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be designed</font>

965
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,640
by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> team so the first day you</font>

966
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:21,070
discover you the common comments for the

968
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:26,950
matter our DP based pvp based or the

969
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,009
state high capacity so we have some

01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:30,630
into account so now the one remaining

989
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">usual use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CCC that means the</font>

990
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:37,930
security cross connect because this is a

991
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:41,470
user to some extent use the different

992
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:44,879
from the common reference model of air

993
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:47,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN but in fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are several</font>

994
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,980
implementation so we will discuss later

995
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:55,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use as a vendor specific young</font>

996
01:04:50,980 --> 01:05:01,990
model or try to defend in the working

997
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:04,359
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes young definition we will</font>

998
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:08,350
take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration data</font>

999
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:10,720
and the operation data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the RPC</font>

1000
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:13,799
and the notification so that a user

1001
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:18,370
completed the young definition for the

1002
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:22,270
models not a universe cope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

1003
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:25,240
the art will<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear because the number</font>

1004
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:29,110
of the types of the art will appear so I

1005
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:31,479
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we can be a future draft so</font>

1006
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:33,730
and also that uses some

1007
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:37,900
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> related with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the arrow to VPN or</font>

1008
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:41,500
the silverware is real that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1009
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:45,070
the OEM they have the VCC VPN and the

1010
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:47,800
trees and also that I'm pr's tpo<font color="#E5E5E5"> em for</font>

1011
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">civil aware especially regarding a</font>

1012
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:53,290
related with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance monitoring</font>

1013
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:57,160
so this Walker will not be taking into

1014
01:05:53,290 --> 01:06:00,730
account by this team so this work we

1015
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:06,310
will leave to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OEM experts to do the</font>

1016
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:10,090
young model work yeah okay next okay and

1017
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:12,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">also when we prayed until the worker in</font>

1018
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:15,790
the past working group but in fact the

1019
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:19,600
art will appear has much relations with

1020
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:21,850
other work so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do some the during</font>

1021
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:25,390
that the cause of the desire we will do

1022
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:28,118
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> liaison work this included the lay</font>

1023
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:31,629
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the best working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group because</font>

1024
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:34,150
the PDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> based vp RS and the PCPD</font>

1025
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:36,430
auto-discovery based the Riviera's will

1026
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:39,760
be taking into account so the liaison

1027
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:42,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">work will be done between the past</font>

1028
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,130
working group under the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1029
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:48,070

1030
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:50,350
meeting stillwater reminders that they

1032
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:56,920
amoeba so this will win design the young

1033
01:06:53,590 --> 01:07:03,790
model so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep consistency with</font>

1034
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:07,480
existing RTP amoeba ok and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1035
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:10,359
design work plan so the first we will

1036
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,300
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architecture design because</font>

1037
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:15,819
we firstly we try to defend the

1038
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:19,900
architecture of the air tubes in young

1039
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:23,560
models so we try to finish this work in

1040
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:27,460
the middle of the May this year so this

1041
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">will define this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is using the work I</font>

1042
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:34,030
include sakova definition and also the

1043
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:38,618
component<font color="#CCCCCC"> division because this is</font>

1044
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:41,380
because we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you truly divided</font>

1045
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:44,890
the art we be a young model design walk

1046
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:48,710
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different apart so there is a</font>

1047
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:51,319
they say user into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> this included</font>

1048
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:53,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the common component and also the</font>

1049
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:56,420
different there may be different

1050
01:07:53,569 --> 01:08:01,910
aircraft for the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> art Olivia</font>

1051
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:04,999
young model so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool hire two</font>

1052
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:09,078
walks we'll be taking into account into

1053
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:12,499
this face after the face so we will

1054
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:16,009
prepare the plan for the concrete data

1055
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:19,040
model design so the concrete data model

1056
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:21,710
design included a common component under

1057
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:25,069
me under the super<font color="#E5E5E5"> Civic pass of the</font>

1058
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:30,500
different types of the air to Vivian's

1059
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:34,609
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to pro whole</font>

1060
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:37,729
the initial draft before the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1061
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:40,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting but according to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pasta</font>

1062
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:44,689
experiments so the work is a very

1063
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:48,319
challenging so that we will propel the

1064
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:51,408
work plan after the first phase

1065
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:54,139
architecture design so that a disgusted

1066
01:08:51,408 --> 01:08:56,809
in the working group to see if it can

1067
01:08:54,139 --> 01:09:01,730
comply with the charter of the air to

1068
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:04,130
pass a working group ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

1069
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:07,189
this is the working a<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure that has</font>

1070
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:10,429
been discussed in the design team so

1071
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:13,068
that we will meet every two weeks to

1072
01:09:10,429 --> 01:09:16,460
discuss the design of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the art will begin</font>

1073
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:20,870
young models ok I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a</font>

1074
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting time has been determined any</font>

1075
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:25,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">commerce this is being run from comcast</font>

1076
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:30,469
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for the scope of work so I</font>

1077
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:32,960
see you cover a bgp based v pw vpls like

1078
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:38,480
to understand like will index<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope we</font>

1079
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:43,339
also cover ugp based v pw s service so

1080
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:46,818
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question</font>

1081
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:53,149
is are you covered under the spec in RFC

1082
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:55,760

1083
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:57,570
that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be covered because yesterday</font>

1084
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,230

you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah can we go back to the</font>

1091
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:22,769
working methods one of the things i'd

1092
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,929
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see as part of the working</font>

1093
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,219
methods is that you update the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wikis</font>

1094
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,960
that we made reference to at the

1095
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:31,170
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the meeting I know that is</font>

1096
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:33,150
there's quite a few drafts one drafts on

1097
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:34,349
there and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure which ones</font>

1098
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,969
overlap it looks like there's some

1099
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:38,070
redundancy because some of them are

1100
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:40,079
listed is l2vpn and some were listed as

1101
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:42,659
pals but if you could reconcile those as

1102
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,610
a result of though the work and the

1103
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">working methods I appreciate it okay</font>

1104
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:53,190
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> definite okay I think of data</font>

1105
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:54,989
we will that in the beginning / that a

1106
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:57,030
user some days the young model

1107
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:59,250
coordination what a message that has

1108
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:01,710
been proposed that you know I ATF we

1109
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:05,060
will comply with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> method</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to</font>

effectively yeah I so would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

1115
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,848
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> its way we need service providers</font>

1116
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:29,070
to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this activity because</font>

1117
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:31,400
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one who are using these</font>

1118
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:36,030
models right it would be really nice if

1119
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:39,210
service providers join this effort yeah

1120

1126
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:04,840
question for the scope is at the service

1127
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:09,110

we did have a vendor-neutral

1183
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,159
already done the work to identify the

1184
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,469
problem space and the gap analysis that

1185
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,940
we are addressing in this draft so in

1186
01:15:31,469 --> 01:15:38,340
the next life pieces as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in there</font>

1187
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:41,848
are RFC 74 39 it won't fight what are

1188
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:44,219
the missing pieces in so that we we can

1189
01:15:41,849 --> 01:15:45,719
deploy ipv6 enabled impetus network and

1190
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:47,880
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in that in that excellent</font>

1191
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:50,610
analysis deified that the only piece

1192
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:54,510
which which which is still missing is

1193
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:56,429
our RFC 66 74 in which the identified

1194
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:58,800
the even identified the section that

1195
01:15:56,429 --> 01:16:00,360
need to be to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and handed so</font>

1196
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,790
that we can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something which is a</font>

1197
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:07,549
address family in

1198
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:10,099
why we have it right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 specific</font>

1199
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:13,820
so this draft is trying to fix this<font color="#E5E5E5"> void</font>

1200
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:15,170
I did pride so exactly two simple

1201
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:17,780
updates as you can see in the next slide

1202
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:20,059
please so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is just an</font>

1203
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:22,670
update to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP another I attribute</font>

1204
01:16:20,059 --> 01:16:26,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is don't define it in that section</font>

1205
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:29,599
so in the current version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the RFC the</font>

1206
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:32,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">PIAA this is all the uncoated for octet</font>

1207
01:16:29,599 --> 01:16:34,880
and the new what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting here</font>

1208
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:37,849
is that you have JP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoded to</font>

1209
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:41,179
cover and ipv6 so there will be some

1210
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:44,000
text to explain in the draft and the

1211
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:46,610
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> up Update is ready to add to the</font>

1212
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,460

1213
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:55,489
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to be sure to use analytics</font>

1214
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:57,559
others as a source and a target so the

1215
01:16:55,489 --> 01:17:04,400
drug is suggesting to define a new type

1216
01:16:57,559 --> 01:17:06,469
which would be an able to include 128

1217
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:11,629
bits rather than the one that is today

1218

only capable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to d 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 230 it's so</font>

01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:15,530
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a the river section that</font>

1220
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:21,799
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be updated in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the RC</font>

1221
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:24,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">60s 74 just to say that's so as you can</font>

see them in the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please it</font>

1223
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:29,780
this drop is it just feeling something

1224
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,199
with that has been unified in general

1225
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:36,259
this RFC the fixes are for me not
