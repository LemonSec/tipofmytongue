00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,669
it is now ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for publication so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,460
the meeting my intention is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

57
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:35,810
write up and 272 IHG for publication

58
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,789
there are no known issues I hope because

59
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,300
anyone have something to say about it

60
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:49,990
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> last-minute comments before we close</font>

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:49,990
this document then he done lose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,570
so

63
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,580
the just just before that I forgot to

64
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,120
say we about we have to rotate this from

65
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:09,250
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a thief and brian at</font>

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:20,800
taking the note and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jonathan is in the</font>

67
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:20,800
jabber so he never

68
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:42,530
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> elect to allow for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

69
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:47,938
space at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> journal employer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

70
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:50,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new protocol data channel this</font>

71
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">version buell i also finished the word</font>

72
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,280
he would last call and all the issues

73
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:58,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">were addressed there are no long issues</font>

74
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,188
the only thing that that's keeping us

75
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,740
now is that it has normative reference

76
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:07,590
to five known RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments from other</font>

77
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:13,770
working group including draft i created

78
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:16,440
music data channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDP and energy and we</font>

79
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,299
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be good not to send me</font>

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,190
to publication yet because anyhow we

81
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,949
could get stuck eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> where he</font>

82
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">called us no comments and to be sure</font>

83
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:29,060
that these documents will not require

84
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:36,990
will not be too much of a change and may

85
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:40,050
require more changes in the document at

86
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,169
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> federal</font>

87
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,879
ethnically negotiation was there was a

88
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,430
decision we took in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous meeting</font>

89
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,259
to use this method and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font>

90
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,349
dependent on it because otherwise we

91
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,599
have to go to other mechanism to openly

92
00:06:52,349 --> 00:07:00,930
the data channel for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for the glue</font>

93
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:03,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">glue yes sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's get sick just</font>

94
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:08,470
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that dependency specific</font>

95
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,510
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their big trunk just</font>

benefit from work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked him and</font>

97
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:18,400
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that i'm</font>

98
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,010
using i was going to ask for another

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,669
couple of years or even stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are</font>

100
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,670
already hooked

<font color="#E5E5E5">people talk later revealed you'll be</font>

102
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,289
nice to get a couple of independent rush

103
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,560
to the eyes look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oakland once that's</font>

104
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,560
done

105

this is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people they</font>

106
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,830
good with people from this working with

107
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,409
we look at you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's in line</font>

108
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,389
with what we design it's mostly first of

109
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,699
all it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christy of course but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there of</font>

110

course all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them yeah that's okay but</font>

111
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,869
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least that we know that it's</font>

112
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:01,819
in line with work is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document or</font>

113
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:05,719
we don't have any issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the proper</font>

114
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,909
will be using in our protocol it will

115
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:11,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply also this probably applies also to</font>

116
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:14,959
be signaling document where you have the

117
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:17,419
real also probably referencing the data

118
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,159
channel and the examples about opening a

119
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,589
few days of general one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

122
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,849
for the plan so does this plane looks ok

123
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,459
that will wait for a while before

124
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:37,338
sending to publication just to be sure

125
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,380
that there are no issues that may

126
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,199
require some changes based on those all

127
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,360
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> normative references so and the</font>

128
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:46,459
church will follow those documents and

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,800
verify that when we can send it to

130
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,649
publication based on what we believe

131
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,689
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not in terms of the</font>

132
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:59,689
reference and eventually we'll get

133
00:08:53,689 --> 00:09:05,000
started recharge we have reach up here

134
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:08,139
and each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stepping down as the area</font>

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,139
that way as<font color="#CCCCCC"> an area directly</font>

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:18,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard Barnes so yeah I have</font>

has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible side repellent plus</font>

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:24,319
if it generally this<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan that you're</font>

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about holding the channel the</font>

data channel document until its

142
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:31,639
references nutritive pretty sensible

143
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:36,439
especially giving it this server<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

156
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:14,689

157
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:19,850
stepping down<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give you some present</font>

161
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,359
myself this here like a specific

162
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,340
milestone for the other documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

163
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to kind of use this to</font>

164
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,790
trigger point but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

165
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,170
kind of wait but they look stable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

166
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,610
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five guys</font>

167
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,839
that's we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought to call the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

168
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,280
but as you have a more specific we have

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,360
a general that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we said that's</font>

170
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,760
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said in the beginning that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

171
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,250
will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want this week to this</font>

172
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,310
meeting to come up with a plan to finish

173
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,530
all the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> documents during the time</font>

174
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,910
period code makes me think I'm fine with

175
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,500
waiting for them to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> more mature</font>

176
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a pain in the neck to take</font>

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">engine was we don't expect a logistic it</font>

178
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,090
might be good though they have a

179
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,430
specific like working group last call or

180
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,440
a right oh where are the other on the

181
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,880
other five dependencies no but the

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,930
dependencies are not from this working

183
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,880
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are from different working</font>

184
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,650
groups I understand so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

185
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,660
controller but at some point they reach

186
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,750
it up how will you know they're mature

187
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,079
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the major</font>

188
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,240
concern that the major concern is this

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,560
it's a music document the other

190
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">documents are also required for the RTC</font>

191
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,250
web they're all this definition of the

192
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:27,400
howdy how you define the SDP the SDP for

193
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:29,170
the but the data channel so so that's so

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,350
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they would</font>

195
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,329
they're stopping us now the major one

196
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,330
that we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see bed because</font>

197
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,130
get better feeling about that it's

198
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,590
mature is this one that's why I put that

199
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this one's leg the recipe</font>

200
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,580
negotiation is the one that's the smoke

201
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,770
bhushan Ferrari because this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

202
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,350
this is just dependency for us because

203
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,780
the RTC web<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you choose another way</font>

204
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,090
to to address the currently to address

205
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,850
the opening of the data channel so I

206
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,350
guess

207
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,050
just when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chairs believe is the cure</font>

208
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,360
natural soda crackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

209
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we'll see that in a music and I</font>

210
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,300
think that's what the point that kiss

211
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,130
was making about blue chairs no I'm

212
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying I'm saying that I was saying that</font>

213
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,029
that's the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kiss was saying</font>

214
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,579
that it's probably he will think that

215
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's mature enough and it's it will go</font>

216
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to he will ask for a music to study</font>

217
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,269
group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> work pretty soon and the</font>

218
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,519
moment it's probably when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you finish</font>

219
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,350
work last fall we can say right that was

220
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,880
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer I want in the game okay when</font>

221
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,069
it when it finishes working with less

222
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,399
power in a music and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will start the</font>

223
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:35,839
publication process here yeah because

224
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,610
yeah because that's that's means that it

225
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,259
also go to publication so we don't have

226
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,060
to worry about too many changes

227
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:46,190
afterwards yes that makes perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

228
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:48,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but it's basically the spoken yet</font>

229
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,750
the point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it weren't for</font>

230
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,180
these references we would consider it

231
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">done and ready to go to publication okay</font>

232
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,930
so we're just waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the references</font>

233
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,380
to become more mature meaning we recruit

234
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,380

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit stronger than i can go so</font>

325
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,050
that's what

326
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,229
RTC web is stronger than recognizable

327
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:07,970
and unfortunately from my perspective ok

328
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:11,150
ok so what a stronger word than before

329
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:15,820
we couldn't they do mandate you think

330
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:20,200
mandates that doesn't know any other

331
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,200
that's a small thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can change you be</font>

332
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:28,039
I don't a cumulative a couple by the way

333
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,039
to see whether long

334
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,520
drop the sentence

335
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:38,360
okay that was also a column for me there

336
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,360
is it included

337
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:47,000
there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just to clarify the</font>

338
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,000
reason I happy these all these bullet

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,350
points are coming from the essay for

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
document that was attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be to the</font>

341
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,219
liaison which stated what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

342
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that was the</font>

343
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:05,330
question I I try to respond to so the

344
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">first part of it is what is the what is</font>

345
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,300
clue about so i can say clue is that

346
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,490
just leave the first the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first sentence</font>

347
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,320
and the lead and the first and second

348
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:19,160
sentence the lead the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day of</font>

349
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,980
the sentence that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok also that was ok</font>

350
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,780
no problem is that i can do that that

351
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,570
was the this other suggestion together

352
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,850
so you keep trying bus 12 that no sorry

353
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,639
a lot of this stuff is actually not

354
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,610
actually directly relevant to si si si

355
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,170
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hun it might be work at</font>

356
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,449
least including the sentence that says

357
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:42,020
we understand many of these drafts were

358
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,840
already been endorsed by 20 PP in 3gpp

359
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,370
TS 24 103<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so can you send me this</font>

360
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,770
one'll of this sentence i will edit

361
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,199
because I mean again like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before</font>

362
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,330
this is like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that we</font>

363
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,730
don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I we don't follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

364
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,350
follow in the 3gpp work so I don't know

365
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,050
the politics of the 3gpp on what

366
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,760
addressing any of the of beer so I

367
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,379
cannot say what's happening in 3gp care

368
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,570
was trying to say just what's in being

369
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,540
done at the idea nothing the documents

370
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,939
are coming of course but we can actually

371
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,280
have a tiny<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit access children I don't</font>

372
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,170
have problem having this sentence say

373
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there was a comment that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

374
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dress so just send mean</font>

375
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,960
I'll add this at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said the same</font>

376
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,799
there was a comment that this that this

377
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">is also endorsing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other men camo the</font>

378
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,610
I think I just heard you say you're

379
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:31,498
pulling out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to the RPG</font>

380
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,119
whether that what was decided right

381
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,860
before get in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the line no I</font>

382
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,629
just said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I aided the reference</font>

383
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,830
because there was no reference in the

384
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:39,869
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> version there was no reference</font>

385
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,539
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion to remove it</font>

386
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:44,759
again yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm about to say</font>

387
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:46,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably mood but if you're going to</font>

388
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,940
say there are geeky web is mandating

389
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,459
codex be clear about mandatory

390
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,119
employment versus just manager so I

391
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the cars was to delete the</font>

392
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,320
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole this whole RTC web</font>

393
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,989
section so because it was addressed to

394
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,980
clue and just don't have it that's the

395
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:07,619
ability to be clear the sentence

396
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,230
beginning at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF the RTC web</font>

397
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:14,668
working group recommended that sentence

398
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:16,739
is to be deleted thank you my name is

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,830
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be easily rented</font>

407
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,710
from the existing drafts from the scope

408
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,740
of demands on I think you can avoid here

409
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,890
because what what I know from the

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,980
that one is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> were sent</font>

433
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:14,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">twelve hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago okay so it's very</font>

434
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:15,680
recent on Evan Evan last ok so I'm sorry

435
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,210
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was ready for a long time</font>

436
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,770
I thought I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> he better figure out I</font>

437
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:24,380
didn't send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we finished we</font>

438
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,980
staged representation and now the next

439
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,980
item

440
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,860
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's the clue protocol</font>

441
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:48,290
and the schema the in the data model and

442
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:50,179
that's a silent<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes how is it keep you</font>

443
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:54,680
weren't here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of ya folks</font>

444
00:25:50,180 --> 00:26:04,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know everything yes sure now you're</font>

445
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:07,550
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry how about now ok so a very</font>

446
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,970
quick update about the protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> in data</font>

447
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:12,590
model I just put down<font color="#E5E5E5"> some slides and</font>

448
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,200
especially with respect to the data

449
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,260
model I just just have one single slide

450
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,470
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's very little to</font>

451
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:25,490
discuss we will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in this meeting</font>

452
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:27,800
but really I think that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

453
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,620
many things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we still have to do in</font>

454
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,110
order to complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> that document as to</font>

455
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:36,530
the protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will start with it so</font>

456
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,870
next please there are some new things

457
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we introduced in version 3 of the</font>

458
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,330
document basically we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on all</font>

459
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,010
of the comments that we gather it during

460
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:53,000
the last meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Honolulu and this</font>

461
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:56,570
has allowed us to make some alignment

462
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,730
with all of the other documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

463
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,360
reflects in a couple of modification

464
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:04,910
inside the state machines both the

465
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,600
participant and let's say producer and

466
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:11,360
consumer state machines then I will just

467
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,189
briefly discuss some preliminary

468
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,370
feedback that I received on the mailing

469
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:18,860
list very useful feedback actually the

470
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:22,429
only thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm now working on</font>

471
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:26,389
that because I received the emails from

472
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:29,090
the other guys on the mailing list just

473
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the end of last week so I see</font>

474
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,919
everybody's busy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a look at the</font>

475
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,830
email setting there had plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of useful</font>

476
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,780
information and I'm not worried about

477
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,030
the comments by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font>

478
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're all in line with what we</font>

479
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,320
were doing so we will briefly discuss

480
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:50,080
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really working progress</font>

481
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:52,429
so you have been word next slide please

482
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,060
basically the differences with respect

483
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:59,480
to the previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> version are associated</font>

484
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:02,840
with some modification inside the state

485
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,390
machine of the participant this is a

486
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,870
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we changed the terminated</font>

487
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:12,590
state and we renamed it as idle this was

488
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,159
an advice that we got from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working</font>

489
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:20,300
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the most important</font>

490
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:24,790
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is related to how we try and match</font>

491
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:28,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clue protocol</font>

492
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:30,710
information to the lower layer signaling

493
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,040
information and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

494
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,650
relates to the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had</font>

495
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,960
about the SDP offer answer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

496
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,990
clearly explained inside signaling

497
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,170
document and which had some impact on

498
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:49,130
our state machines which was let's say

499
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:50,890
not not as clear as it should be now we

500
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:55,160
think that we have clarified this and

501
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:58,300
there is no SD p 0 a state anymore

502
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:01,370
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher-level state machines</font>

503
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,230
we had a thorough review<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

504
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,840
signaling document before working on

505
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:09,280
this and we do believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now they</font>

506
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,830
Darrell E match they are really

507
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">complementary and they were quite</font>

508
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:17,360
correctly together a minor thing that I

509
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,980
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention I did not put</font>

510
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,469
anything in his slides because this is

511
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:25,340
much more academic so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

512
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:29,570
engineering work but we are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

513
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:32,959
let's say properly studying the formal

514
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:36,379
correctness of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol and we are</font>

515
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,770
using some formal methods based on color

516
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:42,260
it by three nights and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

517
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:45,650
have good results in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of safety of</font>

518
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the protocol in terms of capability to</font>

519
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:52,040
reach safe termination state starting

520
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,928
from whatever interaction you can

521
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,570
envisage so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

522
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:58,970
looks quite stable now

523
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,529
and perhaps I will circulate some

524
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,509
information about this on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing</font>

525
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:05,990
list in the next few weeks because we

526
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:09,470
are let's say bringing this work to an

527
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:12,620
end right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now okay about the scheme</font>

528
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,809
updates these are minor things and there

529
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,059
are more things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been suggested</font>

530
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:19,600
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mailing list were basically</font>

531
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:23,149
embedding although all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them we just</font>

532
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,889
briefly touch upon this particular point

533
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">next please so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how the crew</font>

534
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:34,939
participant looks like right now it's

535
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:37,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the top layer state</font>

536
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:40,039
diagram which as you can see embeds the

537
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:42,710
lower layer media provider and media

538
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:46,549
consumer state diagrams which are let's

539
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:51,320
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> drill down state diagrams so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

540
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one that orchestrates the overall</font>

541
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,269
interaction when you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using clue when</font>

542
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,149
you are you have a clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> enabled device</font>

543
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:00,759
so basically there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just the options</font>

544
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,799
phase which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> associated with</font>

545
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:07,399
negotiation of the clue session and then

546
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:10,519
when you transit to the active state you

547
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,820
can play either one of the two roles

548
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:18,350
media provider or media consumer or both

549
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,689
of them clearly next one please also

550
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,600
here without digging too much into the

551
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:26,299
details the main modification is in the

552
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of this diagram where we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

553
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">sdp Oh a box which now has been removed</font>

554
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,029
because you are giving for granted and

555
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,029
this is explained in the document we are

556
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:41,149
giving for granted there is behind the

557
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenes some sort of SDP negotiation</font>

558
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,340
which can happen in case you have to

559
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:48,830
properly set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the clue session but</font>

560
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,139
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clue protocol perspective you</font>

561
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,100
just see those states that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there</font>

562
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:58,158
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of suggestions</font>

563
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:00,860
related to how to potentially optimize a

564
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,279
bit these transitions and I think that

565
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,240
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually okay I don't know if</font>

566
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,130
you had a look at

567
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,020
these suggestions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list</font>

568
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,059
but anyhow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will come back with</font>

569
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,590
feedback on the mailing list related to

570
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:19,410
this point neck sorry next<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

571
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,780
again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the media consumers state</font>

572
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:26,130
machine which by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is the</font>

573
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:31,020
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated one but which now has</font>

574
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">been modified a bit if you remember</font>

575
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,480
there was all the discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

576
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:41,729
riad<font color="#CCCCCC"> verte Iseman tanned this has been</font>

577
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:45,480
removed from the protocol and as a side

578
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:49,410
note<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would also remarked that we have</font>

579
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,620
we have had to remove the differential

580
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:56,580
mechanism some of you has also suggested

581
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:59,580
to bring it in again but based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

582
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,379
discussion that we had in Honolulu I as

583
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,600
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hansard on the mailing list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

584
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,860
believe that now it's time to converge

585
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,379
and perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can leave that let's see</font>

586
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,870
aside for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the moment at least it</font>

587
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,320
was a nice improvement<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had been</font>

588
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:18,750
working on it but I went through all of

589
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,620
the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had and my</font>

590
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,860
feeling was that there was no consensus

591
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,620
on keeping that mechanism inside the

592
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:31,050
protocol and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can follow the thread</font>

593
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:36,659
on mailing list in order to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

594
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:39,540
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next one please here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

595
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to summarize feedbacks that I</font>

596
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,940
received basically there has been

597
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,720
Christian whom I thank obviously who

598
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,350
provided a thorough review<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

599
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:55,110
document and basically apart from

600
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:57,990
pointing out some typos that were spread

601
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:02,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document he also suggested some</font>

602
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:05,700
changes which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would let's say classify</font>

603
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:08,429
as minor changes all of which can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

604
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,190
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted or partially let's say</font>

605
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:16,370
discussed and embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a document</font>

606
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:21,380
with some modifications and you also

607
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:23,460
let's say suggested to further aligned

608
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,200
terminology with the framework and in

609
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,230
fact also here it was right because

610
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:31,770
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of terms that we keep</font>

611
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:34,440
on using which should be formally

612
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:38,219
aligned with the document the framework

613
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,429
document one for old clue capable device

614
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:43,679
and clue session instead of just

615
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:48,659
telepresence session and things like

616
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,569
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next one please just one</font>

617
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,639
pointer to the data model we did not

618
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,740
publish the new version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

619
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,799
model because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

620
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:01,649
the let's say last version at least from

621
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,320
our perspective of such document there

622
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,060
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor things that you are we</font>

623
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,710
have already aligned actually inside the

624
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:13,820
schema apart from again typos in text

625
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:16,110
there are some minor inconsistencies

626
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,580
again with respect to the framework

627
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,210
there are things that we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

628
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:26,009
should be set and fixed in a specific

629
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:29,540
way and the 07 version does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not reflect</font>

630
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:33,150
these as of yet because it was written

631
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,800
before the the very last discussions

632
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,440
that we had but this is i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

633
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,660
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to come out with the</font>

634
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,520
new version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document in let's</font>

635
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,410
say no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a couple of weeks and i</font>

636
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,640
would like to embed all of the comments

637
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:49,970
that I gather it from from all of you

638
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,970

639
00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:03,319
yeah there were yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

640
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:05,030
there were no<font color="#CCCCCC"> more sentences about the</font>

641
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,060
feedback that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we received here actually</font>

642
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:11,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback was from both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian</font>

643
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:15,920
groves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mark Duckworth and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark</font>

644
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:21,109
arrived second and so it he said that he

645
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,900
was avoiding to repeat the main comments

646
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:27,230
from Christian but he<font color="#CCCCCC"> added some useful</font>

647
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,160
further information so thanks again I'm

648
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:40,220
already working on this by the way

649
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:42,470
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I also i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

650
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:46,430
was some other is elided between the

651
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:48,799
framework and the some things related to

652
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,740
spatial information yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's</font>

653
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,820
already fixed in the working progress

654
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:59,620
version the box of bubble exactly you

655
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:02,300
studied<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah yes all right okay so</font>

656
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,009
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean my comment my general</font>

657
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,110
comment was I do not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bore you</font>

658
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,330
with all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the needs and bits and the</font>

659
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:11,720
details but I'm keeping track of all of

660
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:13,790
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when you're going to use</font>

661
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,060
okay so you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> submit a new</font>

662
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:20,240
revision<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0a yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just after the meeting</font>

663
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I think what we</font>

664
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,120
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do now is we we need to</font>

665
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,060
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good reviews of those documents</font>

666
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,299
are we had reviews from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian groves</font>

667
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,400
and

668
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:37,469
mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor and we need more reviews and</font>

669
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,410
I think when we talk about reviews it's

670
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:42,359
also applied to the signaling also so i

671
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,538
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the protocol and signaling</font>

672
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,489
getting to be reviewed so people so

673
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:49,349
someone who reviewing should review<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

674
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:50,939
documents together in order to verify

675
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:55,979
that they are in line yeah that's

676
00:37:50,939 --> 00:38:00,319
correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so anyone who's was</font>

677
00:37:55,979 --> 00:38:00,319
volunteering to you these two documents

678
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:05,218
mark on your face I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> marker</font>

680
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:13,920
and because we will review but I'm

686
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:29,789
it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because he's the author of the</font>

687
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:32,969
editor office of the signaling so he can

688
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:35,939
sue<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep the protocol is to be lined with</font>

689
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:37,739
with the signaling<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but i would</font>

690
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:40,140
expect to to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at those of them</font>

691
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:46,309
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> to verify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the girl consistent</font>

692
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:51,569
with each other okay okay so we have ma

693
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:54,859
that were robbed handsome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you're</font>

694
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:54,859
Paul saying anything

695
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:04,250
a pulse<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so will volunteer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pole I</font>

696
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:16,348
see Jonathan<font color="#E5E5E5"> just asking when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jabali</font>

697
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Paul says yes okay and you can write</font>

698
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:24,960
my name also an but that goes without

699
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:29,910
saying okay so this is about these two

700
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:33,809
and we will probably there's an xml

701
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:35,879
schema in the yeah protocol and there's

702
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:38,130
sdp the signaling and we'll have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

703
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,880
them for director of review both of

704
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,880
those no comments

705
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:49,589
not the data model the signaling in the

706
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:52,270
signaling and the protocol are together

707
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:54,099
the data model<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands by itself because</font>

708
00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:00,160
the ball of them realized that by its by

709
00:39:54,099 --> 00:40:02,920
itself no signaling yeah together with

710
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,348
you signal yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say that protocol</font>

711
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:10,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling really walk hand in hand I</font>

712
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:11,589
would say the complement each other you

713
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,880
guess and that's that's why it's in

714
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:20,680
happy and what I said is that we intend

715
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send the protocol to an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML review</font>

716
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:30,460
and they're signaling to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdp review</font>

717
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,869
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intention and again when</font>

718
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,869
people look at the signaling they should

719
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:38,290
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDP because there's a</font>

720
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:43,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of SBP inside there as for the data</font>

721
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:46,240
schema we need also to review this one

722
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:49,839
and to review it to see that it's in

723
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:57,189
line with the framework yes with the

724
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:59,859
framework document and again anyone

725
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,470
who's not did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not volunteer before is</font>

726
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:05,049
volunteering to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> they to look at</font>

727
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,740
this big schema in the data model and

728
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:11,319
they see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that includes</font>

729
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:20,799
all the all the what's it's in line with

730
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:22,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wistar framework okay and I hope the</font>

731
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:26,380
others who volunteer to do before will

732
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,020
also spend some time to do the the data

733
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,089
model and the data model will also need

734
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go and for the vector model will wait</font>

735
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:35,380
for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> version 08 and yeah and</font>

736
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:41,200
then we'll review that so yeah this off

737
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:43,150
just after 208 and yeah and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font>

738
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,750
some the initial reviews will also send

739
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:50,970
it to xml<font color="#CCCCCC"> Directorate review because</font>

740
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,970
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big xml schema</font>

741
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:58,350
hopefully the next step will be to work

742
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">through class call all those with all</font>

743
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:03,259
those documents the general hood is

744
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:06,390
about this big framework big schema it's

745
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,040
your first let a very big scheme if you

746
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:15,569
have a huge framework as we have inc

747
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:17,400
located<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and and like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you said</font>

748
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,710
you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a reference implementation</font>

749
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,390
for that so that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good when we</font>

750
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,520
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> into publication please there's one</font>

751
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,319
reference implementation so I think in

752
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,270
working with Roscoe sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Henry Allen</font>

753
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,790
we're thinking a working group last home

754
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,790
before the next idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plan</font>

755
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:37,439
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are dependent on people</font>

756
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,820
reviewing the documents now we are

757
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,410
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about wearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call</font>

758
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,510
currently about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> two drop because</font>

759
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:46,230
we're now talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the data the</font>

760
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:48,150
data model and they and the protocol but

761
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:53,840
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes for the signaling which</font>

762
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:53,840
will be Boss drums

763
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,769
the data model yes the data model years

764
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,029
like I mentioned before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to</font>

765
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:08,210
finish all the working group documents

766
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:10,339
before next<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nikki its ambitious it</font>

767
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,989
depends on on the reviewers but at least

768
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:14,989
I hope they're people who are revealed

769
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:19,160
will spend some time the time now in

770
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:21,079
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bc reviews so who is the</font>

771
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,249
first step currently what can be

772
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:29,539
reviewed is the protocol with the

773
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:32,089
signaling which are in a better shape

774
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:37,690
and and the data model just after the

775
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:40,489
publication of the 08 version<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yep</font>

776
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,739

00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,850
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a change from last meeting the other</font>

796
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:10,210
section added based on text proposed by

797
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christian groves it includes permission</font>

on multiple airlines<font color="#CCCCCC"> for EM lines of</font>

800
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:23,620

801
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:26,980
mostly for the Civil<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kostov as far as I</font>

802
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:33,730
remember and there are some simple

803
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:36,070
syntax improvement and next slide since

804
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:39,600
then we had comments from Christian and

805
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:42,700
Paul he surveyed made outstanding issues

806
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,880
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update the negotiation detail to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">NDG to negotiate the data channel and</font>

809
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:56,230
this was based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan that was</font>

810
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">decided in the previous ITF meeting to</font>

811
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:03,070
produce this negotiation instead of the

812
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">once used before as by RTC web what's</font>

813
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:08,350
it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot the name for that</font>

814
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:13,109
one the negotiation that RTC what is

815
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:13,110
using yeah

816
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,569
he suggests that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

817
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:25,959
reference the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> general document</font>

818
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:25,959
rather than

819
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,600
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor</font>

820
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:37,270
that that makes sense but at least they

821
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,369
the text should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent when</font>

822
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:42,309
you're describing what how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look how</font>

823
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:46,930
you decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a couch this is</font>

824
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:48,400
a clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call glue capable call based on</font>

825
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,169
this information because you know it

826
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,569
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp that it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

827
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:56,680
open for clue and that's part of the

828
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:59,170
change in labor yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian mr. Homer</font>

829
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:02,109
guess what was the reason for mandating

830
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:05,890
the dtls for something you had it on the

831
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:07,660
previous life um I think that was is it

832
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:12,970
mandatory to support my authority years

833
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:15,839
one who can rob bad so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one I don't</font>

834
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember what was the</font>

835
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,180
why

836
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:42,129
so so what's what you what's your point

837
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,130
here gelatin

838
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,090
I mean they make him maybe not

839
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so first of all we have to look at</font>

840
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:03,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the what was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement in the notes</font>

841
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:13,759
that we had before and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

842
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:13,760
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the voice ember attack</font>

843
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,369
so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look at the</font>

844
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:35,080
loti<font color="#CCCCCC"> i assume it has to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we</font>

845
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,730
felt that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not go if we don't</font>

846
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,000
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say something about</font>

847
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the PLSS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or TP in the document</font>

848
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the media to learn mean</font>

849
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,540
we can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any security consideration</font>

850
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,040
we can write all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i don't</font>

851
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:51,009
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should mandate it I mean</font>

852
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,410
there's a general trend of security etc

853
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,970
yes but it's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing to do</font>

854
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:57,430
it for clue I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

855
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,799
include specific and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

856
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,750
included three DPP does refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

857
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:06,550
and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the gdp for example</font>

858
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:09,100

860

and so on then you're going to have

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,399
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's why i said that's</font>

862

why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it should be</font>

mandatory to support a lot molecular

864
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:22,419
well that was a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font>

865
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:24,310
we need to say anything in the security

866
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,470
consideration we can have text

867
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:28,060
describing all this yes it's recommended

868
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,069
blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and this was going to</font>

happen if you don't do but i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

870
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:34,330
it's up to clue to to mandate there is

871
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:38,890
not include specific reason to mandate a

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty backwards we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean in other</font>

874
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:45,029
working groups and like more modern

875
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:47,069
working groups that sort of understand

876
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,449
what the

877
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:50,880
for the compartment the internet is now

878
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:53,190
we've gone ahead and said no<font color="#CCCCCC"> this has to</font>

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">be encrypted because we know now more</font>

880
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:58,619

881
00:49:55,709 --> 00:50:00,930

00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,859
we would include<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided taking this in</font>

884
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:07,190
the direction we did for example in web

00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:07,190

886
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:15,260

887
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:18,350
different application would be very

890
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:28,940
decisions Adam Roach again so you can

891
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpret how you want but I think we</font>

892
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,690
actually have some relatively third

893
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,100
guidance from the iesg here around how

894
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,430
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be designing protocols and</font>

895
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,779
this is in line with it it is you want

896
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this the finery we do have</font>

897
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,350
sessions for that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

898
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that what Adam is saying is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

899
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,220
write every anything we want it will go

<font color="#E5E5E5">to the is gene come back to us with some</font>

other recommendation about what to do

902
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,770
and we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a choice so it's it's</font>

903
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,780
it doesn't matter we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make we can</font>

904
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,100
write nothing and then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get back</font>

905
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,950
kick back and say you have to write

906
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,420
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

907
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,770
current and they like you said that the

current status what's happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> DI</font>

909
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:09,020
here yes sir richard barnes to add yet a

910
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:11,750
third interpretation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeitgeist it</font>

911
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,830
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me the way i read the iesg and</font>

912
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:17,390
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 statements on this topic that their</font>

913
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:20,390
suggestion is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default for new</font>

914
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:22,819
stuff needs to be security and that you

915
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:25,730
could argue for having an insecure mode

916
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:27,680
if you really need and that seemed like

917
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:31,370
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> an appropriate right for this</font>

918
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,640
document so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's obviously</font>

919
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:36,950
must support details as you because that

920
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,799
that is the place secure mode

921
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:43,040
I think it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth having a</font>

922
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:46,280
discussion here about why other modes

923
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:51,529
might be necessary and what levels of

924
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:53,390
requirement it goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

925
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:58,160
we have because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a documenting in</font>

926
00:51:53,390 --> 00:52:00,109
NB about security for RTP and we were

927
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,810
saying why it's not mandated to disaster

928
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:04,759
RTP when you define payloads because

929
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:06,380
there may be different mechanism by

930
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,470
which you can secure that necessarily

931
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:12,800
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use DTLS you can use other</font>

932
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:14,598
layers and security which will make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

933
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,720
secure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you won't do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's up</font>

934
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:19,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the implementation so but I think in</font>

935
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,069
this case where we are doing solution

936
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,859
probably we will at least we should say

937
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:30,260
that we should be supported that's what

938
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:32,270
my belief is this market work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

939
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,810
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he also had this</font>

940
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:38,380
same discussion Security section<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

941
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:38,380
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

942
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:46,190
the framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor currently says that</font>

943
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:46,189
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> srt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PDT OS must be supported</font>

944
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,150
okay so if we mentioned it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font>

945
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:56,140
documents and probably other citizen

946
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,140
okay

947
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,380
I mean again I'm not positive that this

948
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,460
is I mean it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is still</font>

949
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,830
the right thing to say but I mean I

950
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess the case I would be I'm</font>

951
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,360
incinerating is that close I mean I

952
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would expect to be used not</font>

953
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,760
only on the public Internet we're

954
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,260
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> pls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

955
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,770
mandatory but also in private

956
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:24,850
environments where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the need for</font>

957
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:27,590
it is somewhat less compelling though

958
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:29,630
given the races monitoring and my shirts

959
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:34,790
as less compelling as we once thought it

960
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:36,320
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that so I mean</font>

961
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:38,870
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope that agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> men</font>

962
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree to implement I guess the matter of</font>

963
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:44,500
concern would be is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when we've gone</font>

964
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,940
to some trouble to make blue work with

965
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,500
structure all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SBP to work with a lot</font>

966
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:53,960
of you know legacy little boxes and

967
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:58,220
using a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail s everywhere would</font>

968
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,069
break them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully updated support</font>

969
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,390
the soon but

970
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,390
um I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

971
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:12,000
as far as i remember the protocol

972
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,590
document does not currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> because then</font>

973
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,310
we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question do we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

974
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">catch Megan's onto to offer both but I</font>

975
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:24,900
guess it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can offer it s are</font>

976
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:27,300
to be and just I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

977
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,130
to offer both of you and that's an

978
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,190
implementation issue and I have no issue

979
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean it I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

980
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:36,270
secure and so on but but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

981
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,859
there are environments where security

982
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,620
for example is provided either means

983
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we should have strong words about</font>

984
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this absolutely otherwise it's gonna you</font>

985
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,840
know end up in I ski anyway so so so

986
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,970
okay so my suggestion will look at it

987
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,970
sent to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list the current what this</font>

988
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:55,410
text say and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquids okay I I what I</font>

989
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:58,109
get is that the preference is to have

990
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:00,359
must be support and a lot must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used</font>

991
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:03,990
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the preference here is and</font>

992
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:07,290
supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes supported means that there</font>

993
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:09,089
can be other that it's supported the

994
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,800
usage is based on what you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using for</font>

995
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:13,520
security based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the specific</font>

996
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,990
environment and the implementations i

997
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:22,259
would agree and I think part of it is

998
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:25,790
simply that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay since we have to</font>

999
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:29,410
be highly interoperable with sip anyway

00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,410
do not negotiate glue and end up with

<font color="#E5E5E5">it seems fine to me to say that it's</font>

1002
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,740
somehow strongly recommended

1003
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:45,079
an optional protocol basically was at

1004
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,078
fault

1005
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:53,100
okay um

1006
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,190
hmm

1007
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,098
it's it's going to the list but i will i

1008
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:12,020
will send we will cut the text from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:14,329

00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:25,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's addresses the concerns that</font>

1011
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:27,890
people have yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the next</font>

1012
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,950
step is to produce versions 06 was

1013
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:32,480
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues fixed and of</font>

that goes that's a signaling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what</font>

1016
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said it goes together with the</font>

1017
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,849
protocol and we have the reviewers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1018
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:47,329
review that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those documents those two</font>

1019
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:51,369
documents and hopefully we will be able

1020
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:54,140
to soon start over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nebraska any other</font>

1030
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:53,950
so we have a zero for version of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">there the text is clearer now in order</font>

1050
00:58:54,849 --> 00:59:03,790
but you don't know which one it is so we

1051
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:06,220
needed to define some some identifiers

1052
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:08,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will allow you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know which one</font>

00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:18,220
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm seeing is currently being used</font>

inside this<font color="#CCCCCC"> MCC next slide so for</font>

00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:23,049
mapping in RTP stream to a specific MC

00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:26,740
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MCC the crew cab try these used</font>

the media center must send for<font color="#CCCCCC"> MCC the</font>

00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:34,089
capture ID in the RTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> header and is a</font>

00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:37,808
RTP rtcp SMS messages the document

1060
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:39,990
defines these two extensions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1061
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:42,060
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already being referencing the</font>

1062
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,220
signaling and in the

1063
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:49,590
I think also in the data I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I saw</font>

1064
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:54,470
them also in the data model externe this

1065
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:57,210
identifier that that's been being used

1066
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:59,939
so so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the major changes the</font>

1067
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:02,430
state of the document needs some<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1068
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:05,700
we will do another editorial review we

1069
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:07,020
don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> section so we need</font>

1070
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:09,750
to add the Security section to the

1071
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:12,900
document which will do after the meeting

1072
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:15,630
and is there another slider<font color="#CCCCCC"> desi last</font>

1073
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">night and so that's what I said there's</font>

1074
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:20,600
a final editorial worth neither then

1075
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:26,940
after that it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready also for</font>

1076
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:29,310
working group last call did anyone did

1077
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:31,560
anyone read this document lately the

1078
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:34,230
last version I think I did it about a

1079
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:41,910
month ago writer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jonathan yeah something</font>

1080
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that 04 is ok so we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1081
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:50,220
will need<font color="#E5E5E5"> also volunteers here to to</font>

1082
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:55,860
review this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> any at least after</font>

1083
01:00:50,220 --> 01:01:02,879
we put the next revision 205 volunteers

1084
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:04,350
of her mark anyone else wish to put

1085
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,680
Krista then he will read this document

1086
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:14,520
he likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read documents mr. on the</font>

1087
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:19,640
spinning<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds reasonable</font>

1088
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so this is the plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this document</font>

1089
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

1090
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,790
we had

1091
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:37,080
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last presentation as we</font>

1092
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,760
can see we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much but I don't</font>

1093
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:42,299
think we have much to discuss more in

1094
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:48,240
this meeting so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we will do</font>

1095
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:54,740
will cancel the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday session and the</font>

1096
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:57,740
last thing that we would like we will

1097
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,740

1099
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:20,589
survey session I'm fine disconsolate if

1100
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:22,370
there's nothing else but if there's

1101
01:02:20,589 --> 01:02:25,670
something as it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good maybe two</font>

1102
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:28,069
look at the outdoor an LS maybe it would

1103
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:30,110
be good we do it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list with 70 s</font>

1104
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:32,240
ominous I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> alce a nutritionist and</font>

revised version today on the list please

1107
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:41,630
look at it and the amount and wait for

1108
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,390
response about it okay that's there's no

1109
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,460
need for session for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them richard barnes</font>

1110
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:48,500
in light of the earlier conversation

1111
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:50,390
about the USSR compare wonder if it

1112
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,180
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth grabbing some folks</font>

1113
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:54,420
working web RTC and that stuff and

1114
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:57,480
seeing

1115
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:58,970
precise shape with the security

1116

it that might only be a 15 with her it

1119
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,810
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be music</font>

1120
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:35,309
problem is that the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that be</font>

1121
01:03:29,299 --> 01:03:39,720
we don't have most Rob and Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing</font>

1122
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:41,790
there in the meeting so to be they won't

1123
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to be part of it even if you do</font>

1124
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:47,119
an offline could become complicated

1125
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:51,180
first the google will think about it

1126
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:54,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i think that and the last thing</font>

1127
01:03:51,180 --> 01:04:00,890
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is we will try to</font>

1128
01:03:54,329 --> 01:04:03,690
prepare in some time timeline for

1129

months in order to be able to finish

1134
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:20,940
last call before july i hope it's not

1135
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:23,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">too ambitious i mean i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

sickening list is all from the protocol

1183
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:35,759
draft or reviews from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol draft</font>

plus Krista<font color="#CCCCCC"> holmberg plus focus of it is</font>

1185
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,839
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just here Paul what we say John Paul</font>

similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of cork</font>

1187
01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:01,549
and a Christian is not Christian is not

1188
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">only on the list but probably assume he</font>

1189
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:07,960
will continue to give the documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1190
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:07,960
when asking Christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> goals</font>

1191
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:19,649
yes

1192
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:21,870
follow the full sentence or anything so

1193
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:24,960
we have at least one so the recognition

1194
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:27,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so we will publish this as</font>

1195
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,089
the conclusion would send all this

1196
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:36,630
information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we review it and</font>

1197
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:38,519
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the timeline by the finish so</font>

1198
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:41,759
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question along those lines I</font>

1199
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:44,040
know that sometimes people request not

1200
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,408
to have over<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to have reviews at the</font>

1201
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:48,479
same time I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of looking in</font>

1202
01:08:46,408 --> 01:08:51,120
the room for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like head nods or</font>

1203
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,769
whatever here would it be helpful to

1204
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,330
actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread these out in a</font>

1205
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:57,330
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> way or would it be better to</font>

1206
01:08:54,330 --> 01:09:00,778
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just ask for this and oh</font>

1207
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:03,089
would it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> better to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just get them get</font>

1208
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:05,009
to them as we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a meaning as</font>

1209
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:07,140
the documents are ready so I'm just

1210
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:13,649
looking for any general opinions on this

1211
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:15,900
I think deport that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were making</font>

1212
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:18,540
before is that the protocol and

1213
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:20,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling they are tied together and</font>

1214
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:23,339
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reviewed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the data modem</font>

1215
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,980
we are waiting for your vision and for

1216
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:28,080
the article ii mapping we will have

1217
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:30,358
another revision that before we want to

1218
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,799
review so that's they this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font>

1219
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:36,330
ordered<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just I</font>

1220
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:39,870
sometimes see groups try to schedule

1221
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:41,019
reviews and end up failing on the

1222
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:43,599
scheduling of

1223
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:44,770
to review you know if you do it

1224
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,380
basically when the drops are ready

1225
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:48,609
rather than saying well this draft is

1226
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,830
going to be this week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other</font>

1227
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:52,089
draft is going to be this week and half

1228
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:57,280
the time the reviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't come in</font>

1229
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:58,960
during that time period<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if there</font>

1230
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,259
are no other issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

1231
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:06,100
discuss it between finish here this

1232
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:08,770
meeting and hopefully we won't have to

1233
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that we want me to have a clue we</font>

1234
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:15,100
think in the next idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font>

1235
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:21,330
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to celebrate the closing of the</font>

1236
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:23,470
word me if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can object be cutting</font>

1237
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:27,070

1238
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:30,280
you church so we'll close the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1240
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,670
sessions

1241
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:33,890
I think everyone signed the blue sheets

1242
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,280
but in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't please come up</font>
