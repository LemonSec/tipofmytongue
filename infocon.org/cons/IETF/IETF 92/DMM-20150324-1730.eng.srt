are kind of working towards their

43
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:44,400
solutions and most likely these working

44
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:49,480
groups are also at some point of time

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:52,570
going to propose some some individual

46
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,970
drafts that then we handle like any

47
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:58,270
other individual ID and out of those

48
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,690
like a relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group designs we</font>

49
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">can also then decide select the the</font>

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,969
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group items to do a call</font>

55
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,479
late

56
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,840
maybe they start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

59
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:28,180
somewhere lost in translation yeah I

60
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:32,299
have those let me do the magic thing

61

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,480
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> are after seeing this and</font>

75
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">after reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these are and in</font>

76
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,900
addition to all these they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font>

77
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,500
number of jobs proposal ever presented

78
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,590
prior to the formation of his team and

79
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,320
so we should also take them in

80
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:46,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">on day and they were quite a number of</font>

81
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,750
different proposals are and so it when

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:55,669
look at them the artists is the charter

83
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:59,660
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working team contest each other</font>

84
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:03,070
and from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter yet it is supposed</font>

85
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,830
to the final solution for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaming</font>

86
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,080
assignment and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recession change</font>

87
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:14,990
of direction so<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the week or the</font>

88
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">next slide on head upon means we lose</font>

89
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:25,250
the top night but disappear yep I we

90
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,550
went to the you question of what do what

91
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:32,210
what are they how to harmonize all the

92
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,820
different solutions and because the

93
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,740
differentiations are some of them are

94
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,680
complementary and some of them are quite

95
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:45,890
different so he tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to way to humanize</font>

96
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:48,109
them and then there's a function<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

97
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:52,220
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already defined is the penguin</font>

98
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:56,120
function in the which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> fighting in</font>

99
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,540
749 and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only one defined an</font>

100
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ending function is basically to enter</font>

101
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,780
the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> to broadcast address and</font>

102
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:08,030
it makes life however<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay however there</font>

103
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,270
are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> other functions of the anchor</font>

104
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,640
that are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them are</font>

105
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,620
there some of them are not there and in

106
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:21,490
order to try to take them into account

107
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:25,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next life is trying to distinguish</font>

108
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the distinguished of the angling</font>

109
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,600
function of the IP address anchor IP

110
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,990
addresses versus the bottom one is

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,959
the section the tub<font color="#CCCCCC"> on entering the IP</font>

112
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">address is suffering from in almost</font>

113
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,268
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> chooses your ankle so the question</font>

114
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,819
is what are you angry what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do at your</font>

115
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:48,579
engine and internet IP addresses obvious

116
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:50,709
but the other one is to anchor the

117
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,810
section and we normally put them

118
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:57,399
together as a single move pretty anchor

119
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:00,880
or separate and on and and a difficult

120
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,980
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can ask more deeply what</font>

121
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,850
are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> angling rhetoric brothers etc</font>

122
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,399
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can separate them and an idea</font>

123
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">justice obvious ok and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Evelyn</font>

124
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,870
section we will talk about section will

125
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,149
use the thing of it end to end car as

126
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,529
that when however if you put an anchor

127
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,940
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that you like</font>

128
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:23,050
you're trying to get it passed through

129
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,180
and they are scenery which take their

130
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,870
this Englishman each other so I'm going

131
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go to some of them next one suppose</font>

132
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are entering the IP address only ok</font>

133
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,519
so its own have an IP address then they

134
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">are true they are sionary in which you</font>

135
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,430
use the IP address of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so</font>

136
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:44,880
today so no power no reason you have to

137
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,109
network that one on one side that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on</font>

138
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,140
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person the 11 Angus idea just</font>

139
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,680
one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anger level two angles idea just</font>

140
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,870
you and you can are the mobile node with

141
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,050
an IP address or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I beat you could be</font>

142
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">running section which is using deception</font>

143
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,479
has likely to so it's using it in the

144
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">next life is that exactly the same thing</font>

145
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,560
except that you are using and idea just

146
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,890
not of the network so the section is IP

147
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,560
one on the right hand side everything is

148
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:22,890
the same except that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're mmm i p3 is</font>

149
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,290
using a section identified by IP one

150
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,210
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the United to lose money in</font>

151
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,490
that section that would take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

152
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,650
lot of some herbs / example alpha i was

153
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,420
looking at scenario in which you are

154
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">using address which does not belong to</font>

155
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,959
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll chop and then</font>

156
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:43,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next line is that they're suicidal</font>

157
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,920
mobility you want to keep IP address in

158
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:49,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid section so I IP IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and you</font>

159
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,870
move to a different network as you move

160
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,699
you're keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that IP address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

161
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,920
you keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I PHS you need to have</font>

162
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,810
some of it if Politico to do it so this

163
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not human</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scope yet because this is</font>

164
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:04,829
my be addressed in the next slide is

165
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:08,640
that you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> releasing a tough time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

166
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:11,520
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are changing the I the ending up IP</font>

167
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,340
address so the anchor was in the

168
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,290
side moving to the right hand side so

169
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,570
you change it and then you change IP

170
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,390
address so that's that's obvious that's

171
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,940
a section 1 and section 2 and then mixed

172
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,400
nut mix I is that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing exactly</font>

173
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same thing as before but you don't</font>

174
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:34,020
want to change an IP address so if you

175
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,280
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change IP address ah one</font>

176
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">classical thing is to actually move the</font>

177
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:45,060
entering of octave entering functioning

178
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:48,060
from the number one to number two<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

179
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,510
you move<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> water that</font>

180
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you but the anger also look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too natural</font>

181
00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:00,050
so as you move into so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> welding will</font>

182
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,050
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you move okay on</font>

183
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:08,460
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example is</font>

184
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:12,360
by using a prefix delegation which is

185
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,080
used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> need more now that will call you</font>

186
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,380
just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be fixed variegation and then</font>

187
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:26,330
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole I PHS belongs to the other</font>

188
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:29,130
side and then so perfect zoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> legation</font>

189
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,200
you are assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's initiated by the</font>

190
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,510
client you know how are you delegating

191
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,110
the prefix is the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dhcpv6</font>

192
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,550
beauty cable they're not in time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

193
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say tht repeating I'm trying to</font>

194
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,500
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using dhcp PD here</font>

195
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,690
it's not from that kind it's a

196
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,340
certificate aggregation from the anchor

197
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:52,050
to the other engine farm and run without

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:54,530
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> turning-around is wrong okay so you</font>

199
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,530
said Nemo

200
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:03,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up next so what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

201
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:09,250
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are using them such as the</font>

202
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix dedication is one example or you</font>

203
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:19,509
use sdn or<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sole control parents or</font>

204
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:22,719
compare different very salty if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

205
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:26,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control pad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will be so</font>

206
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,149
suffice all entering the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

207
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,149
we doing to anything intersection

208
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:56,100
try to lower lower lower a little bit so

209
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,100
that you can see it online yes

210
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:21,910
now let's we are going to anchor talk

211
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,910
about the anchor of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> section the end</font>

212
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,640
we still at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the of the</font>

213
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,820
address but there's a set the end of the

214
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:42,410
section you enter the session or the

215
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:45,320
flow of what occurs is defined for

216
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,920
example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the section of the tank</font>

217
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:51,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of the session so do any idea</font>

218
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,630
just totally so the golem move over

219
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,949
there but then the end of the section

220
00:15:53,630 --> 00:16:00,920
yeah i just cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

221
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,960
nature by this end of the section the

222
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:08,620
changes for the candle<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealer do</font>

223
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,620
something to it and good abundantly that

224
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:14,209
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other so</font>

225
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,180
there's a bank of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the section on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the lab</font>

226
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside and end of a session also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

227
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:22,010
right hand side in addition to the

228
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">anchor of the IP address the basis of</font>

229
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,000
the inkling of the section show you this

230
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,150
picture they are in the same their

231
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-located no not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a beautiful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font>

232
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:37,100
they will see that later so it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

233
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide ah in this side are is</font>

234
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:53,060
basically the role of demise ation what

235
00:16:40,280 --> 00:17:07,040
people know it talkable optimization but

236
00:16:53,060 --> 00:17:09,440
then you move the session so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so</font>

237
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,050
this thing can move over there so this

238
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,050
thing is not but the 90 end up stays

239
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:17,569
there this you know this might be

240
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,180
adjusted you there something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just</font>

241
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,310
won't come over you the back end goes to

242
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:34,570
their butt the stretch your hand is

243
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:37,659
redirecting just just a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> note so</font>

244
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:42,189
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are supposed to stay in that that</font>

245
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:44,540
red area for the air protein yeah I know

246
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,180
one quick question i'm having a tough

247
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,889
time in following this right so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

248
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,650
the session anchor what is an IP anchor

249
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,560
is IP you know so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understood is</font>

250
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,080
you're putting your host route for it or

251
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,899
it not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a host or your routing a</font>

252
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,550
specific IP flow through one path and

253
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,860
you're still keeping the mobility

254
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,899
session on a different on a different

255
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,449
anchor is that what it is are you

256
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,450
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a if this intercom of</font>

257
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:14,480
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is not I section 8 huh</font>

258
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:17,690
dyslexic let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this moving session</font>

259
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">anchoring yeah there was a sly some</font>

260
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,330
somewhere before on the definition of

261
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,090
the second anchor the session the end of

262
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,659
the session means you try to cause the

263
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,370
chocolate to go for it is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

264
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">section</font>

265
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:36,909
Ellis was not not Oh for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

266
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,470
you're using at any cost then it will we

267
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,340
go for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them but not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

268
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,410
okay be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple question right how</font>

269
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,720
is the forwarding plane in the IP

270
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:51,610
network able to steer one particular IP

271
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,590
flow on one path and all the rest of the

272
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,590
flows on a different path are you

273
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,730
assuming that there is a flow based

274
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,490
stitching in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP network are you</font>

275
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:08,200
making flow-based you know forwarding

276
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:12,250
decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am using the term session</font>

277
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,590
and flow public we probably mean the

278
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,860
same thing for time being<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if</font>

279
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,189
there's a flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether you want to call</font>

280
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,570
it flow section is up to you so there's

281
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:30,370
a flow the flow is is going from C n

282
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:34,960
roll through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new musician and you</font>

283
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:38,080
cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flow to go go session enter and</font>

284
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,310
we directly the other section anchor so

285
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,830
so this IP

286
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,340
didn't change IP address so this why we

287
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:49,820

291
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:04,010
maybe a call flow direction so how far

<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous slightly just for this case</font>

295
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,610
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous case so in this case</font>

296
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:18,550
that's the most obvious and pragmatic

297
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:21,800
scenario and here the mobile node keeps

298
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:26,450
ip1 even though it moves to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> excess</font>

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,150
an anchor at all this scenario right so

301
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,340
the anchor one remains the anchor and

302
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:38,360
forwards packets to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> milanos current</font>

307
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:52,280
it's running a section which is

it move over there so the IP address of

the mobile has<font color="#CCCCCC"> has attitude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

323
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,290
difference is that the anchor has

this in the past what we talked about

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,610
was in everybody agreed we talked the

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that interactions and that we also</font>

355
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,900
talked about you know prior work which

was the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> aha work which was done</font>

you know many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years back we I thought or</font>

358
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,960
at least many people thought we are

going to you know bring that work back

360

into life and you know reuse leverage

all of that work but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> completely</font>

going in a different direction I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> NOT</font>

363
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,460
following how it aligns to what we

364
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,000
discussed in the past we had a

definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> angling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> function which</font>

367
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,830
not have any definition of over the

00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,330
definition is an anchoring function and

370
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:43,750
we usually top of it as a knife and that

371
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:47,080
function<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on an IP address is they</font>

372
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:49,540
simply to to advertise the prefix for

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,320
that I PHS that's that's that's what we

374
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,889
have met that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is not enough I'm</font>

375
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,629
saying

is not enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a that time is only</font>

entering the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's also</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we normally talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> angling of a</font>

379
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,610
section is different from the angling of

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,320
your IP address what is the session then

what is the session in here terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

you have an ongoing section running as

393
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,030
what you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you have an</font>

394
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,660
IP address right and then you have some

395
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">cup session / flow which is not specific</font>

396
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:55,390
related to the IP of the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:58,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you have a session almost by</font>

398
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,160
itself that can move that's independent

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,169
of the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the mobile device</font>

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:07,180

401
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:09,460
example ip24 MN and ID session with IP

402
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,530
one but it doesn't own the IP is that

403
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,630
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying yeah I let's go back</font>

404
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,330
to the definition open until five or six

405
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,180
different sign on the definition of the

406
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:23,080
two definitions that are get up is this

407
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,450
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android optics you ain't an IP</font>

409
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,779
guys kid<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay everybody knows that work</font>

410
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,229
you

411
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:34,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the section that means you you're trying</font>

412
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:38,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cause a packet associate intersection</font>

413
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,129
of the floors are good to go fool at

414
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,799
that pawn yeah I think I think there's a

415
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of confusion or issue with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

416
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,809
right one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that under mobile side does</font>

417
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,269
the mobile still only IP address where

418
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,460
the session is targeted for that's one

419
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:56,820
question and the other parts the

420
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:59,009
transport of that flow to your anchor is

421
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,049
it through the routing topology or what

422
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:03,599
boarding topology allows that to work

423
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,339
right so maybe that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point that is</font>

424
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,928
unclear<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's in</font>

425
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,299
the draft but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is if you can</font>

426
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">clarify that would be helpful that's so</font>

427
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:14,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">many previous life go to up to cycle</font>

428
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:17,070
poco basically there are lots of

429
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,549
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to do with the mobility</font>

430
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,649
us you can and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people call the</font>

431
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,889
anger is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet is</font>

432
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:29,099
going for it or whether you can use the

433
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:31,709
aggression coming or or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that on</font>

434
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:33,479
or to some of these detection so they're

435
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,119
different method that the sex that be

436
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:38,789
that the section that the end of the

437
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,039
section and you such as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> redirected</font>

438
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,320
inductor indirection Stewart hungry and

439
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,769
cashew ation the<font color="#CCCCCC"> encapsulation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

440
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,320
these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> functions that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

441
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:50,729
that end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> section right okay okay</font>

442
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,519
I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so for the session you're</font>

443
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:55,950
saying that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> different method</font>

444
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:58,649
routing this means not a flow level

445
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,539
right I can see you doing tunneling but

446
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:02,968
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> still requires somebody set up the</font>

447
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:04,710
tunneling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going erection of a</font>

448
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:06,419
she finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inner why you</font>

449
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,919
realize yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why I'm saying</font>

450
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for tunneling I think you can do</font>

451
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,609
that but for routing you're not routing

452
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">a flow level all right i mean you're</font>

453
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:15,718
saying all these different<font color="#CCCCCC"> four ways are</font>

454
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,619
ways of doing it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyways it's okay i</font>

455
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:20,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand it</font>

456
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:24,869
doesn't quite make sense to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

457
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:26,580
at the end of day so uh now we go Jeong

458
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:28,570
Jeong for about five or six teaspoons

459
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:33,309
nine now this is

460
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:36,519
I think this one is this is the end

461
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:39,490
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP adjust only there's</font>

462
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:42,279
nothing to do with this action<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font>

463
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,380
is entered the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> just only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it</font>

464
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,970
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have none of those function and</font>

465
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,340
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved to anger to the</font>

466
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,460
other side ok so the chocolate will

467
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,070
float<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is a this email</font>

468
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,580
didn't touch on the second anger and

469
00:27:54,070 --> 00:28:01,570
then go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next line and yeah this</font>

470
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:04,990
one is a typical mobile IP scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

471
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,720
we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> a section the end of the</font>

472
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,000
session the red box on the left hand

473
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,470
side and the right box on the other side

474
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a typical premium c- okay</font>

475
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,279
because this one is thus that's the

476
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:21,580
tendering it keeps the binding and so on

477
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it has a binding of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the session using</font>

478
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:29,320
IP address one over here in red is

479
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,480
pointing<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the address of the</font>

480
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">access road</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand side ok</font>

481
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:42,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

482
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:46,090
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the anchor anchoring function of</font>

483
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:50,110
the century you never one to number

484
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:54,639
three so this one is all this box is

485
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:57,800
gone but this one remains the angry

486
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,660
still have a nice to visit but at a

487
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,850
cabinet will not go there because the

488
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">anger the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> session authority in the</font>

489
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">second you are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hungary and then it go</font>

490
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,000
directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is a typical row</font>

491
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:14,720
optimization scenario now in a relative

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,200
my sessions in aerial the anger of the

493
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,500
address doesn't didn't change but the

494
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,360
packet doesn't go to that anymore I mean

495
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,790
it's do advertising it doesn't go there

496
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:33,469
anymore but the packet book directly go

497
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:36,590
to the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay optimization is</font>

498
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,270
different because the way if you look at

499
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way route optimization is working</font>

500
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real the care of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address and the</font>

501
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,309
home address are still present in the

502
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,170
packet headers it is the way use of in a

503
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:50,629
destination option cider and you know

504
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,510
with other logic it's happening it's not

505
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know you cannot take route</font>

506
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,890
optimization is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great example and you</font>

507
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,830
know relate to this I'm just keeping it

508
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:04,670
as high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because this is that</font>

509
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:07,129
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing that exact my exactly</font>

510
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">bollinger but it's keeping it as an</font>

511
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:13,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">allergy right you're right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

512
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,590
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah because they're different photo</font>

513
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:20,210
shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to harmonize all of</font>

514
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:22,070
them by an EP if you try that it seems

515
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me the Deacon proposal can we catch</font>

516
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see what you know i'm having a tough</font>

517
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,070
time and you say there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session here</font>

518
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,050
on one anchor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address our</font>

519
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,879
dresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> us is associated to that session</font>

520
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,260
is on a different anchor what does it

521
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean what does it session mean they're</font>

522
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so no it's not a section does</font>

523
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,850
that the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bull it's a</font>

524
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fathead associate with the interception</font>

525
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:56,330
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flow food that horn okay</font>

526
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:59,449
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> right okay um read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anyway</font>

527
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:01,309
so you broke the knowledge that that you

528
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,440
have a

529
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,600
a problem with your terminological

530
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:13,309
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really follow what what you</font>

531
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:16,070
mean in certain point so anyway so that

532
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,230
that's the place kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do add more</font>

533
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,379
some clarity about this or than the

534
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:27,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the treaty m denotes from from</font>

535
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:34,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">wilm from the previews inter meetings</font>

536
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:37,668
anyway so yeah definitely and bring

537
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:40,189
bring this up like like the more clarity

538
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:43,039
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean but about this session and</font>

539
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,720
then and when you actually see it move

540
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,499
to anchor function but you are still

541
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,419
advertising the extreme prefix ho if you

542
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:52,429
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe that with existing</font>

543
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:55,369
technologies or similar technisat we

544
00:31:52,429 --> 00:32:03,499
have today that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would basically make it</font>

545
00:31:55,369 --> 00:32:08,240
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand what what yeah i</font>

546
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:09,980
mean so like like like this one you

547
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,330
could basically say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now the anchor</font>

548
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:17,749
function moves to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other one</font>

549
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:20,928
right in this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like you would do</font>

550
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:23,210
is you would yeah yeah but here like you

551
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:26,690
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the router there that can be</font>

552
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:29,570
your uncle<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you new mobile doing</font>

553
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,779
attaching that one but for texting

554
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:36,428
session are not optimized from this net

555
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:40,299
tree to the other one so if you can

556
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:42,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe that like like how you move the</font>

557
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,779
likewise what what is to make us seem to

558
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:48,289
move the existing session anchoring the

559
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:51,230
yet the network to and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so that</font>

560
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:53,900
would basically clarify that that

561
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:57,559
language that people normally yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

562
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,290
you're basically put<font color="#E5E5E5"> interceptor Hackett</font>

563
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:05,360
country represented next week and

564
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:08,360
capture it or we directed to net<font color="#E5E5E5"> to okay</font>

565
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,699
and that function of intersecting and

566
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:15,409
capturing it and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> captioning and so on</font>

567
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,990
either I'm calling it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> anchoring</font>

568
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,809
the section so that the racket goes

569
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,429
through them okay all right Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

570
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:23,870
Anthony so we let you continue the

571
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:28,850
discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list on this</font>

572
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:34,010
body underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your Howard draft as</font>

573
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:37,120
the design team output you can eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

574
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:41,000
job and please send<font color="#E5E5E5"> your comments in the</font>

576
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,799
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> either drafter is the consensus of</font>

577
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:50,390
the design team<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people already do</font>

578
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,389
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have discussed the draft</font>

579
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:56,470
during the teleconference and the people

580
00:33:53,390 --> 00:34:09,070
in the design team agree on that right

581
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:09,070
or it's just your individual know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

582
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you so let's move for the</font>

583
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:31,010
working team too so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> per state it's</font>

584
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:33,649
yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is the report from</font>

585
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">both exposure and selection working team</font>

586
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:41,839
next like please so senseless idea if we

587
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,629
held two conference calls in conference

588
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,919
call number three you see the date the

589
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:52,159
attendees the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda was to discuss the</font>

590
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:55,250
item number one on our plate which

591
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,680
involved defining<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the mmm API</font>

592
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,800
between the applications and the IP

593
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:05,299
stack on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile node and for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

594
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,570
had two<font color="#E5E5E5"> drops on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

595
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,430
the notes on that link which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

596
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:15,650
quickly capture in this presentation

597
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:19,520
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so basically for item</font>

598
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:21,110
number one in earlier meetings we had

599
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,590
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of principles</font>

600
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:27,380
basically we had agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we gonna</font>

601
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:29,470
define an extension to RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32 14 which</font>

602
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:35,660
is the source of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this selection</font>

603
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm and the baseline RFC already</font>

604
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,670
has two flags but we recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

605
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:44,240
that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three distinct</font>

606
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">flags in order to achieve our objectives</font>

607
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,640
in this working group and we define

608
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,160
three different types of IP addresses

609
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,160
for that fixed IP address sustained

610
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,060
ideas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Omega IP address and we had</font>

611
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:03,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">also identified that the solution must</font>

612
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:06,740
trigger dynamic dynamic IP address

613
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,960
configuration if the desired iPad as

614
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,979
type is not already available IP style

615
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,440
and so based on this we have looked at

616
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two drafts in that call next slide</font>

617
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">please the first draft the check marks</font>

618
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,340
well anyways it does work with the RFC

619
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,700
50 40 framework it does define those

620
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:36,410
three different three new types of flags

621
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:38,810
and also covers the case when the

622
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,569
requested time I Gladys's not only

623
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,700
configured it has the hooks to go and

624
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,119
configure them and make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font>

625
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:51,919
applications so this draft satisfied

626
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:57,290
those three principles we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> identified</font>

627
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:00,290
already on next one please the next

628
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:04,640
draft it it's also based on extending

629
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:09,200
our CP<font color="#CCCCCC"> 214 but it only defines two flags</font>

630
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,450
not three<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we couldn't fully</font>

631
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,390
understand the semantics of those flags

632
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:18,710
the authors were not going to call we

633
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:21,529
welcome further elaboration on that

634
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:24,109
nevertheless it's obviously missing the

635
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,349
third type even with the right semantics

636
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:29,290
and there's also no notion of

637
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:33,440
dynamically configuring the IP address

638
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:38,509
next slide please so based on that the

639
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:41,900
working team agreed to propose adopting

640
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:45,490
the first draft as the baseline for the

641
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">dmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API and as part of the discussions</font>

642
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:53,750
people also brought up a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to capture</font>

643
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:56,060
backward compatibility and danny mozes

644
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,910
proposed text for that which we have

645
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:03,410
already incorporated into the version 03

646
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:07,220
of this draft to capture the case of mix

647
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:10,250
and match between the application where

648
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:14,480
it supports and what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts tagging</font>

649
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:17,990
network supports so the working team is

650
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,530
based on proposing to proposing working

651
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:24,859
group to adapt this draft as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base</font>

652
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:27,710
lab and I have while we have captured

653
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:30,828
that on the meeting minutes and also

654
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:33,589
last week or we can help ago I sent an

655
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:40,970
email on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list indicating our</font>

656
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:42,500
intention to propose that so either

657
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,020
rights now or eight end of the

658
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,800
presentation I'm hoping the chairs will

659
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,000
ask that

660
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,170
chin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group for adoption</font>

661
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,170
you guys want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end just</font>

662
00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:01,550
just just go to the end and then we'll

663
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:05,360
check and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is stuff do I make</font>

664
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:08,420
this common size as individual so I have

665
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:11,420
a fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for your proposal</font>

666
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,250
here so what what's this proposal what's

667
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,390
the relationship between your proposal

668
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:26,780
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmm it solve anything any</font>

669
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:31,069
problem in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmm charter yes yeah that</font>

670
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:35,540
allows for example to<font color="#E5E5E5"> DM do the</font>

671
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:38,360
on-demand use of mobile eating that's

672
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,330
one thing well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm at the pen you just</font>

673
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking us back to a year ago I mean we</font>

674
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:46,850
have been going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this exercise oh</font>

675
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,759
no no no I work very misunderstood your

676
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:53,240
question yeah i<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

677
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,470
chatter that we have a work item to

678
00:39:53,240 --> 00:40:00,830
explore the mobility state but by

679
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:03,560
reading your job<font color="#E5E5E5"> your proposal he simply</font>

680
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:06,230
sudden the solve any problem you have

681
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:11,120
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some extension yeah previous</font>

682
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:19,030
one previous slide please no no previous

683
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:22,220
one yeah you have some intentions of the

684
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:25,850
you define some new flags but how do you

685
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:28,870
use that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't mention about that</font>

686
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:31,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the draft but even how you use that</font>

687
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,710
the draft describe those flags<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font>

688
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,570
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't say these are flexed it</font>

689
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,490
says the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application who needs that</font>

690
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,100
should use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag and this is how</font>

691
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:43,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">they step should behave this along the</font>

692
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:46,220
lines of RFC 5014<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you measure not</font>

693
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:52,100
black<font color="#E5E5E5"> asian how to use use of black but</font>

694
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:55,009
you don't mentioned was what is what

695
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,690
what's the problem you'll sound in the

696
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,579
TMM scope

697
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:02,420
again I think you're talking about

698
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:05,060
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this we had gone</font>

699
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:09,619
over at the previous idea we have shown

700
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:11,960
how this item fits into the charger so

701
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:13,819
if you're if you're asking if this fits

702
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,470
into the charger we had already

703
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:18,109
addressed that in the previous ITF

704
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,750
meeting sure maybe you pull up these

705
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:22,730
slides from the archive and then we talk

706
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:27,920
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now I mean we have passed it</font>

707
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:29,750
I mean I don't I don't have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

708
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,030
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel i'll give you each</font>

709
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,040
other but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't i think there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a gap</font>

710
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,400
between your photo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the chatter down</font>

711
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,500
as much as basically my my concern yeah

712
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,420
can you tell that gap precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

713
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:48,410
that gap is ok so i think the proposal

714
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:54,609
you have two three more flags about the

715
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">IPR grass right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok are three more flags</font>

716
00:41:54,609 --> 00:42:04,069
how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> God's fixed substantive and our</font>

717
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:08,569
medic right but is there either any any

718
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:12,020
solution we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get any solution related to</font>

719
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:15,859
2d Emma<font color="#E5E5E5"> help use this I'll a black</font>

720
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:18,079
people help just as my suggestion maybe

721
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:20,210
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I largely champion break so</font>

722
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,800
doping you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an able account</font>

723
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,500
that you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> made some assumptions</font>

724
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,560
on that for the BM solutions right we

725
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:31,790
made certain assumptions right you know

726
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,770
for you know you know avoiding you know

727
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,390
essentially to avoiding host<font color="#E5E5E5"> halls or</font>

728
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,800
whatever reasons right we thought for

729
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,049
awarding tunneling or other approaches

730
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,210
without demon is a vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know smaller</font>

731
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,920
cells they will lead to further client

732
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,780
you know wherever it anchors that

733
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,300
becomes 0 you know local the local

734
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,069
gateway becomes anchor right later it

735
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,950
moves you know when it moves from that

736
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:54,770
anchor to a different location the idea

737
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:57,680
was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable the client to you know get</font>

738
00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:00,109
a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obtain a local IP address</font>

739
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,299
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and over time phase</font>

740
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:03,770
out the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the that that it</font>

741
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,900
was using the previous network or

742
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,210
previously very close anchored right

743
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,190
from the so the client at a point of

744
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,540
time has multiplied

745
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,430
right but he doesn't know which IP

746
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,829
address is<font color="#CCCCCC"> born right now with this</font>

747
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,109
world we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabling the client to be</font>

748
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,030
more intelligent right it's essentially

749
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,259
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> enabling in applications to be</font>

750
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,650
more intelligent right now that

751
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,359
awareness is not present right so this

752
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,839
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental to the from the overall</font>

753
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution I chrome is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which this narrow</font>

754
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:36,020
that you described and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution I</font>

755
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:39,319
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I don't agree with mr. to flex</font>

756
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:41,740
your proposed here so how how can this

757
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:45,730
flat<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the to solve the problem that</font>

758
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:49,879
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> transformation can you give us one</font>

759
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:52,940
specific example how this work did you

760
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,430
read the draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dapeng firm okay so in</font>

761
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,500
the draft we clearly explained through

762
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:02,379
these flags the application can indicate

763
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,380
what type of an ipad is it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

764
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,349
yes guys I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you guys are</font>

765
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:11,839
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> these discussions careful i</font>

766
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:13,609
gotta tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this we have breaking we</font>

767
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,430
have broken down this problem into

768
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,740
pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one piece is how the</font>

769
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:21,710
application indicates its intention is

770
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:24,319
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that another piece another</font>

771
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:28,069
piece which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in this draft is how</font>

772
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:30,200
the ipsec on the horse excellent yeah so

773
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:31,910
that's another piece and we have shown

774
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,578
all the breakdown of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the</font>

775
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">past I have a strong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

776
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:43,970
not following this work closely I'm kind

777
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:46,549
of tired of<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeating first day which is</font>

778
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:52,269
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension to dhcp to support these</font>

779
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:54,650
lands<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes we are also broken into</font>

780
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:59,618
different drafts there is a reason for

781
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that because here we proposed extensions</font>

782
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:16,970
are c-54 see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are so we</font>

783
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:19,578
don't hold the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMM problem in a single</font>

784
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:25,459
drug<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope you never realize that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yep</font>

785
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:28,369
so just to clarify so what opera is

786
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,650
presenting is tested one enable of the

787
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:33,589
whole set so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the network to host</font>

788
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:38,440
part this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d from the application to</font>

789
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:43,339
stack part so it's just like likely and

790
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:46,549
and then these<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever is</font>

791
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:49,819
presenting is the independent of the

792
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:52,579
actual network to host communication how

793
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:55,579
you realize that whether you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP</font>

794
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:57,980
slack or whether it's a mobile IP or

795
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:01,099
something else like whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> singling</font>

796
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,930
there is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> person to pick it but you</font>

797
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:06,380
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for applications and tool to</font>

798
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:08,660
indicate like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have cars in the</font>

799
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:13,910
instance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bolsa whatever and we</font>

800
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:17,480
currently 5040<font color="#CCCCCC"> no she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already has the</font>

801
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:19,460
concept of<font color="#CCCCCC"> CoA and home address but</font>

802
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,370
that's purely from the

803
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,740
mobile ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view and now in the</font>

804
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">dmm we have the kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

805
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some addresses are okay to call and</font>

806
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,919
we want to know a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

807
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:35,780
kind of address the application is going

808
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask for so that's where is heading to</font>

809
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:43,970
I just wanted to understand the pain

810
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:47,680
will you satisfied with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer to</font>

811
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:51,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">your question or is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal open I</font>

812
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:56,029
think ah it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> open because I I</font>

813
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,830
don't think this this reflex is can

814
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,680
solve all the problem of the dynamic

815
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:03,770
anger such as my personal present<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

816
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:07,910
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me join in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and answer first of all</font>

817
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:10,960
it's not supposed to answer to answer

818
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:14,029
all the problems that we have what we

819
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,120
talked in the past and we identified is

820
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:20,090
that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about supporting</font>

821
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,370
mobility and anchoring there is some

822
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:27,230
overhead in the network in order to

823
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:30,500
support anchoring either via host

824
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:33,130
routing or via some tunneling and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

825
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,690
like that and another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

826
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:39,770
detected was that some applications

827
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:43,460
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> require this over heading for</font>

828
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:47,210
example some applications won't break if

829
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:51,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source IP address changes while they</font>

830
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:56,300
are in session so what this draft

831
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:58,370
proposes is to identify various types of

832
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,710
services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are required from the</font>

833
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:06,410
network the three types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services and</font>

834
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:12,170
proposes that the application convey to

835
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:14,629
the IP stack what type of service<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

836
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,970
require and then the IP stack through

837
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:18,710
other means<font color="#E5E5E5"> will communicate that to the</font>

838
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:21,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and then the network will know</font>

839
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:25,400
to allocate the appropriate resources

840
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:28,520
for those specific applications this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

841
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">what this draft is about yeah so in</font>

842
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">general I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the general idea</font>

843
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,400
but I don't agree with

844
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:38,009
solution here so just my point and

845
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,280
another another thing i want to mention

846
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:43,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should also solve the dynamic</font>

847
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,220
anger problem I think audrey has just

848
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:50,250
described as scenario I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

849
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,470
draft sawdust scenario and it's not

850
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:57,540
supposed to solve this scenario it only

851
00:48:52,470 --> 00:49:00,589
is trying to resolve the ability of an

852
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">application to convey to the network</font>

853
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:07,890
what its needs are and if you don't

854
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good solution please</font>

855
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:14,730
propose a different one and then we can

856
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:17,730
compare ok so how're you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

857
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:21,060
minutes so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to complete the</font>

858
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:25,170
set or you have specific clarification

859
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:32,820
questions for the for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> light or</font>

860
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:36,590
previous lives I have comments ok let me

861
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:40,680
to comments that may take some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font>

862
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:44,400
don't know how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the first</font>

863
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment is this I I am aware i think of</font>

864
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost all IP address auto-configuration</font>

865
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,790
mechanics at ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

867
00:49:53,790 --> 00:50:02,880
parallel of of this requesting a kind of

868
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,770
ip address like for example here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree</font>

869
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,420
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this application request</font>

870
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:08,759
something to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack i agree with that</font>

871
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,580
as eggless you know that right now see

872
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,390
5014 has that yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we didn't</font>

873
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:24,150
invent that notion what does it have can

874
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:27,890
you move up yeah yeah oh stop so yeah

875
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:31,910
yes it defines the notion ok we are

876
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:34,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">aledo TX okay happy these are FC has</font>

877
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:37,118
these two options did you see a address

878
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:41,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto-configuration protocol that</font>

879
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:44,390
satisfies this Alex we just said that

880
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:47,089
this thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to solve it</font>

881
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's an other work that we need to do</font>

882
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:52,069
Pete<font color="#E5E5E5"> Winton network and two holes to</font>

883
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:54,859
bring that prefix coloring information

884
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:57,349
for excellence coloring yes that we are

885
00:50:54,859 --> 00:51:00,140
at prefix coloring work<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't go</font>

886
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:02,059
anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to come back here</font>

887
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,609
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point i mean this work will</font>

888
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:06,920
plug into a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> like prefix</font>

889
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:10,940
coloring that's the top part the<font color="#CCCCCC"> api</font>

890
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">park the bottom part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in progress I</font>

891
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,589
don't know how to further explore it

892
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:18,740
just express my skepticism that I don't

893
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:21,980
think a other sort of configuration

894
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:24,229
mechanism has this parameter like

895
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,180
requesting a kind of IP address you

896
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,519
never request a kind of I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an</font>

897
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:32,000
address you don't really need to request

898
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:34,279
a kind for example when the network

899
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,279
provides an address it can say that this

900
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:40,039
address has these properties like it's

901
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:42,319
going to be anchored and then then to

902
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,319
stack when you asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you asked for an</font>

903
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,058
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't Ankara and the</font>

904
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">address that was given you from network</font>

905
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:51,920
doesn't have that information then tis

906
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,759
chlorophyll binding to that kind of

907
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,309
address it fails in a host can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give</font>

908
00:51:55,759 --> 00:52:00,859
me an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some router that offers</font>

909
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:03,559
this address there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no that kind of</font>

910
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:07,369
stuff yet yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working when you are</font>

911
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:09,890
confident is going to happen well you're

912
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:11,930
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose those as well so these</font>

913
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:15,170
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will plug in together I agree</font>

914
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if for example dhcp working group</font>

915
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:21,140
or some router or slack or something

916
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:23,750
give the type for another scene in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

917
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:25,879
mechanism then this<font color="#CCCCCC"> API makes sense we</font>

918
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:27,470
cannot go to both are continuous but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

919
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should those two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

920
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:31,848
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> progressed together yes yeah</font>

921
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,129
one big bands on you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you</font>

922
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:37,250
cannot make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a last call now on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

923
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:38,119
a last call it so that's what you are so

924
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:42,670
working about

925
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:45,529
Alex so adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safe so Alex and</font>

926
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:49,039
episode there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more stuff on</font>

927
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:51,410
Thursday on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same topic they just</font>

928
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:55,839
don't fit in the same presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

929
00:52:51,410 --> 00:53:00,399
so let's take 32<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday visa so and</font>

930
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:03,349
when we were creating this Oh charter be

931
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,509
discussed the same thing true back then

932
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:10,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we agree that we need to have this</font>

933
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:15,799
network to host protocol to carry

934
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:20,390
information so it's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> tackling</font>

935
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:22,519
one task at a time yeah so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

936
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:24,650
those makers in place yet this is

937
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:27,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">related work going otherwise that we can</font>

938
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:31,880
for shall pluck into or just go and do

939
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:35,089
our own stuff so and regarding these

940
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,700
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are like LEGO</font>

941
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:39,470
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they can all clicking</font>

942
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,509
together but that's not a gating factor

943
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:43,149
for working group adoption but that

944
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,960
would be a gating factor for like

945
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,569
publication I mean these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

946
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,700
hold up we can always drop things but

947
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:52,038
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> working of adoption we don't have to</font>

948
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,868
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all pieces to be lined up we we</font>

949
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">already did the two options that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

950
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:59,809
shown are already specified in RFC and

951
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:01,910
are not implemented in operating systems

952
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for example you say if convicted a</font>

953
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:05,690
you don't see that others being a home

954
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:07,549
address or a care of others or

955
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,160
particular type of other so you know

956
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:12,799
it's it's you have the address that's

957
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:17,779
all and maybe it's prefect that's all so

958
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:19,700
these are things specified in RFC 5007

959
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:21,529
plement<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

960
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,140
are you sure have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you checked the linux</font>

961
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:26,869
latest little scale yeah yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

962
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:30,460
I'm checking it yeah I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

963
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:33,440
longer this notion of experimental

964
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,450
anyway you can ask for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen</font>

965
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,809
doesn't provide you with a yam proper

966
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:41,480
answer so you have two heaters in place

967
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:43,249
anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we are running out of</font>

968
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so we take it was the first the</font>

969
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,410
first come first yeah I have a second

970
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:50,990
comment I

971
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,270
not read the draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think this kind</font>

972
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:55,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thing is for the application running</font>

973
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:58,700
on the terminal right on the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

974
00:54:55,850 --> 00:55:04,580
is it right it can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a mopar</font>

975
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:09,710
outer I think the applications not don't

976
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:12,290
run on the mobile outer ok so if so then

977
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:16,910
I think we should specify it in the

978
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:19,610
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation exactly that</font>

979
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:21,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is for a mobile hosts on can</font>

980
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,740
return<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Roger as well I mean if yeah</font>

981
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:28,970
but the applications yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right point</font>

982
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:31,370
taken so next one so Marco has been less

983
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:33,379
than using a wire on your comment to

984
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:38,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">write we do run applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on mobile</font>

985
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:41,990
orders today like I'd be IP SLA come on

986
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,970
so on point number one right between the

987
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,470
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that two parts to it I</font>

988
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:47,419
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to repeat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

989
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:49,310
alpha is saying right essentially

990
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowing the application to be aware of</font>

991
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:54,020
that dress property is one thing and

992
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:56,120
then allowing the horse to you know

993
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,980
obtain a particular type of address from

994
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:01,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network is another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem another</font>

995
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">aspect that is both on dhcpv6 anybody</font>

996
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:04,910
scoring right we proposed extensions

997
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,410
right there is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

998
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,149
in with I agree there was you know we

999
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:10,580
publish this sometime back it did it

1000
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:13,220
made it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were some because</font>

1001
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:15,259
of some other work in dhcp took a slow

1002
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,000
track now that we have proper use case

1003
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,560
and a motivation we should be able to

1004
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,850
that those documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> and amateur shape</font>

1005
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,700
we should be able to move them on a fast

1006
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:24,950
track so the linkage is there now with

1007
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,180
respect your other comment if 5014<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw</font>

1008
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know some socket option is not</font>

1009
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented in some linux kernel that</font>

1010
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">has nothing to do with this discussion</font>

1011
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,750
we are on a standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> singh</font>

1012
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,760
implementation is we of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course our</font>

1013
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:37,550
motivation is to get implementation but

1014
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,960
there does not mean anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this</font>

1015
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:44,420
from the point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

1016
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:46,790
discussion so just a brief comment which

1017
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,290
is not criticism but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font>

1018
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:51,380
may take into account for the further

1019
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:52,849
discussion so nowadays when you program

1020
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,759
applications you can

1021
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:58,339
you have the means to bind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic</font>

1022
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:00,739
particular interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> or IP address so I</font>

1023
00:56:58,339 --> 00:57:02,479
see the value here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that you simplify</font>

1024
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:05,239
this that the application just says I

1025
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:07,910
need this kind of IP address and the

1026
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:09,859
colonel takes care of the rest right so

1027
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:13,519
you mentioned here if for example an

1028
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:15,680
application requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> matting address the</font>

1029
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,569
colonel takes care about configuring one

1030
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,788
if there is no no matta good friends but

1031
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:21,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not sure if this overcomplicates</font>

1032
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,829
poor thing so if there is an application

1033
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:27,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">which just send an HTTP request</font>

1034
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:30,710
expecting one response so for that

1035
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:32,749
request configure an IP address but why

1036
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:36,940
not just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the existing ones</font>

1037
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:40,729
like a central earth how is it called

1038
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">sustained takes a medic or the fixed</font>

1039
00:57:40,729 --> 00:57:47,779
point right right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse again and</font>

1040
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:50,420
where's the proposal work of<font color="#CCCCCC"> medicating</font>

1041
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:52,849
things and the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually really</font>

1042
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,650
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the application doesn't care</font>

1043
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:57,710
that it doesn't use any of these flags

1044
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:59,359
and then that's the legacy behavior but

1045
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">if the application has a certain need</font>

1046
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:05,119
like it needs sustained IP address than

1047
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:08,150
it has to explicitly indicate that

1048
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,920
otherwise it may not work right i mean

1049
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,200
it's hit or miss how come the

1050
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,420
application besides that chemistry is

1051
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,759
the developer knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it developer of</font>

1052
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:18,920
the application knows the intent and how

1053
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application is so much behave you</font>

1054
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,479
would know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a video</font>

1055
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:25,249
streaming client or a chat client or at

1056
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:27,950
the NS<font color="#E5E5E5"> klein and you know what it really</font>

1057
00:58:25,249 --> 00:58:30,379
needs whether it needs a sustained IP

1058
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:34,700
address or a fixed IP address or nomadic

1059
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:38,779
then you use the right flag<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so Albert</font>

1060
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:40,399
just do you still want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue with</font>

00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">your presence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we are running out</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1063
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:47,560
capture these two slices those lights

1064
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we can we can continue this</font>

1065
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion like on the mailing list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1066
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:59,410
will revert era so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok well just go</font>

1067
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:01,840
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> call the agenda was to</font>

1068
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:04,390
discuss principles for item number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1069
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:07,480
and three basically these are the items

1070
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:11,319
for our working<font color="#E5E5E5"> team to describe how the</font>

1071
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:15,010
IP configuration protocols are extended

1072
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:22,090
in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support this IP address</font>

1073
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:24,820
types okay and basically network at the

1074
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:28,000
time of configuring an IP address or

1075
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:30,430
prefix on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hajj should have a way to</font>

1076
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,190
convey the type of the IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> address or the</font>

1077
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:35,350
prefix similarly the host at the time

1078
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's requesting I cut it you should have</font>

1079
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:41,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">a way to convey the type it needs so</font>

1080
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:44,980
we've gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a bunch of iPads</font>

1081
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:47,740
configuration techniques and we

1082
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">recognize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well we basically identified</font>

1083
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:55,330
the need for extending ECB v6 step sizes

1084
00:59:51,820 --> 01:00:00,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration mobile ipv6 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ike</font>

1085
00:59:55,330 --> 01:00:05,140
v2 in order to plug in the bottom part

1086
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:08,020
of this API<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right now the next step</font>

1087
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:11,290
is to we open the floor for people to

1088
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:13,840
propose solutions for that those items

1089
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:19,480
and we have one that we will see on

1090
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:21,640
thursday<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right the item</font>

1091
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">number four is about describing how we</font>

1092
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,710
will not decide between IP layer and

1093
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,079
other layer base model to support which

1094
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,680
would

1095
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:35,089
have any progress in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> office</font>

1096
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:38,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">calls okay thank you okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple way my</font>

1097
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:41,599
first concern is that you will like lie

1098
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:44,539
cause you to define three cancel IPA

1099
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,519
fridge perfect and further and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1100
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:51,289
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> developer may be confused</font>

1101
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:56,598
about the prefix and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will sell</font>

1102
01:00:51,289 --> 01:01:01,099
seldom you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these candle prefix and</font>

1103
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:04,869
my second concern is that is is the

1104
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:08,329
definition of the IP free products and

1105
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:11,690
sake option should be done in the MMO

1106
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:16,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">workgroup how in other IPO related a</font>

1107
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:18,559
loop work group<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't understand</font>

1108
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:21,469
the second one the first one you're

1109
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:26,390
saying the people may be confused yeah

1110
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:29,289
yeah I believe most application

1111
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:32,719
developers they don't care about the

1112
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:34,430
networker at the dress yeah they just

1113
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:38,089
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop their application so you</font>

1114
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:41,118
build of riders and more several cans of

1115
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:43,670
an ivory dress day they don't they don't

1116
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,829
understand what's the mobility is right

1117
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:49,910
yeah so yeah well that's why we

1118
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:53,529
documented here so the applications that

1119
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:57,410
wants to have efficient networking

1120
01:01:53,529 --> 01:02:00,380
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm techniques would adopt</font>

1121
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:02,449
this API which we're going to document

1122
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:04,459
there are the white papers presentations

1123
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:07,099
and education all that so that's what an

1124
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:08,808
API takes to get adopted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field so</font>

1125
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:11,569
hopefully people will read and

1126
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:14,930
understand them correctly so ok that's

1127
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:17,130
the postal we first educated with pasta

1128
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:22,049
educates people and the

1129
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:26,089
and when they develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> our eyes and my</font>

1130
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:29,640
first quest my second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is the</font>

1131
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:33,078
perfect technician and the soft option

1132
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:37,440
technician be defined in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a.m</font>

1135
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:48,750

1136

1137
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,130
them in proposals probably will be

1138
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,598
considered here first and then they may

1139
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:57,240
be taken to respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to working groups</font>

1155
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,140
my presentation from previous idea if

1156
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:46,619

question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thursday and the continue</font>

1160
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:58,980
this interesting stuff on a wave a short

1161
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:01,589
comment I think it may be out of design

1162
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:06,289
team they need somebody to reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1163
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:06,288
talking pre fault officer so

1164
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:13,140
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> point some things out so these</font>

1165
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:16,350
are working teams they have been working

1166
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,230
openly anyone could join these working

1167
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:21,480
teams they were fully open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these</font>

1168
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,850
documents are in part of any other

1169
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,490
individual document these are just

1170
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:28,170
interest group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1171
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:31,799
together and they put together a

1172
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:35,580
document so they are not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a design</font>

1173
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,560
team product<font color="#CCCCCC"> stale bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people with</font>

1174
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:41,370
the same interest working on something

1175
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:43,740
and posting them yes I agree it is good

1176
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:46,230
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> open working teams and open all</font>

1177
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,970
your conferences and the phone calls

1178
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:50,370
were announced on the email list and

1179
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:53,580
this is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good on another hand it is</font>

1180
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:56,009
at the meeting at IDF that decision

1181
01:04:53,580 --> 01:05:00,090
should be made right and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not</font>

1182
01:04:56,010 --> 01:05:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">be patient somebody who has not</font>

1183
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:05,550
participated to the audio conference so

1184
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,060
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me explain again its default of the</font>

1185
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:13,580
individual who didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Alex Alex</font>

1186
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:18,360
so it's an open process if someone

1187
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:22,319
doesn't participate open process it's

1188
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:26,490
his own or her own fault and and then

1189
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:29,490
all these you can anyone can propose the

1190
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:33,089
same in<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the same document on the</font>

1191
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:36,990
same area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask for an adoption they</font>

1192
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:38,610
have been meeting like four times posted

1193
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">two minutes on the mailing list at this</font>

1194
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what we discuss and so on and da da</font>

1195
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,720
da<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just went and asked for</font>

1196
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:47,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> adoption of the document anyone else</font>

1197
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,890
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done the same proposal</font>

1198
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:53,460
document and ask for representation

1199
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:55,680
talents on it is open but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has no more</font>

1200
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:57,990
legitimacy than discussion and of course

1201
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,879
not and that's why everything will be

1202
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:03,810
handled here on the mailing list and

1203
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:06,330
enter meeting that we have so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1204
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:09,060
run through like any other individual

1205
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:11,700
document there's no difference on that

1206
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:14,490
the reason why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually ended up with</font>

1207
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">this process is like that the is to</font>

1208
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:18,209
reduce the amount of documents on the

1209
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">same topic</font>

1210
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:22,950
if people aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

1211
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:27,210
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why don't they would do</font>

1212
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:30,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of in advanced working</font>

together and bidding for other documents

1214
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:40,080
that's the only reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I was</font>

1215
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:43,910
