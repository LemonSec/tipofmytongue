proposal for researching the<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,340
working group so it is proposed to add

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,580
are thrilled

118
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,789
documents so the dynamic capitalizations

119
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,640
working that was not changes since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

120
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,850
last idea but we have received some late

121
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,320
comments based on the text providing for

122
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,660
the new charter so there is an ongoing

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,469
discussion between a pity Ariana make

124
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:10,600
mainly we will see how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

125
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:13,600
Peterson's only I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have</font>

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,200
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EAP response identity how to use</font>

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,910
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information so not changed in the</font>

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,590
last idea but it was agreed that the

129
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,390
last idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

130
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,349
with documents so we will dispossess and

132
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:37,780
same conclusion for this one so now we

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:41,199
have some time for the description of

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:43,319
list to help to shape the document and

145
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:45,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">then in particular the highlights for</font>

146
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:50,479
example the using the TRV for each data

147
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:55,319
field and that one was fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> india 01</font>

148
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:58,379
revision and then the last meeting there

149
00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:03,179
was a major comment to suggest you use

150
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:06,149
the IP fix instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> defining the radix</font>

151
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:09,019
itself but to do that require some

152
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:11,699
mapping so that comment was also

153
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:15,569
incorporated and then reflected in the

154
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:17,549
03 a revision of text okay so so one

155
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,549
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is on this side the status</font>

156
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,799
of reflecting all the comments so far

157
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:25,470
from the London meeting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toronto</font>

158
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,139
meeting the condo meeting and also on

159
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,499
the Middle East or being<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken care okay</font>

160
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,419
so that's a status and the reflecting

161
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:36,029
the year 03 a tradition next slide

162
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:39,329
please and then let me just go over

163
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:41,309
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get to the point that was the</font>

179
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,430
very useful attribute using the existing

184
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:41,010
configure one or more port mapping but

185
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,230
here is using the radius to configure a

186
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,410
mapping between internal and external

187

external IP v4 address<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok next one so</font>

189
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,560
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the highlights of the three</font>

190
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,880
attributes we proposing and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

191
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,699
account into a kind of the other

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,720
comments we received so we modify the

193
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:10,170
frame extension for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ratings as such</font>

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,900
the type<font color="#CCCCCC"> lings an extended type and then</font>

195
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,420
followed by values so these format

196
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,510
actually is following exactly what

197
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:24,329
defining I've seen 6929<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

198
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:28,020
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> type could be one chosen from</font>

199
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:30,720
the 241 242 240 320 for or two for the

200
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,689
four deaths up to the energy decide and

201
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,820
then the extended type also define a

202
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,740
very well<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined in the city not 29</font>

203
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:43,310
this is application<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to use them and</font>

204
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:47,040
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value is a bunch of embedded</font>

205
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:51,030
theories which<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing and also</font>

206
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,949
our economy comments received from this

207
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,839
working group so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the year the</font>

208
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,840
high level pack the format

209
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,750
and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a list of the theories</font>

210
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:07,870
we will be proposing we have to support

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the three extensions of the ratings</font>

212
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:14,570
attributes and those attributes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all</font>

213
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,380
contain one or more embedded theories so

214
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:32,360
these are the individually in fine so as

215
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:34,370
we then no changing the 01<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

216
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,040
reason before that is because we now

217
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,600
require to mapping between a radix and

218
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,180
then IP IP airfix and a prefix has

219
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,390
internal ipv4 address and ipv6 address

220
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,579
so to account to accommodate that then

221
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,080
we spring the two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> javi but</font>

222
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,200
they are semantics are the same only the

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:59,330
address and is different ok so these are

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:03,590
the the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tier means we and</font>

225
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,930
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll continue the LC 6929 then you</font>

226
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,000
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a nice way to describe the</font>

227
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,400
identifiers right so the Harwick

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,670
hierarchical structure there for example

229
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,270
IP port limit attribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

230
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,729
type extended type dot IP port type tier

231
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,100
VIII those are mandatory right and then

232
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,260
the IP poor limit theory of course is

233
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,690
mandatory because you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> passing the</font>

234
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,210
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the server to the port</font>

235
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,900
device and then demand what is the part

236
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,860
lab of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nepali limit for specific IP</font>

237
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,810
address or maybe all the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

238
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,170
configure the device and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wrong</font>

239
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:46,520
bracket rd optional device so this is to

240
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:49,819
follow the RC 6929 how to express the

241
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,449
identifiers for the radix with

242
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,460
attributes next one please so so far

243
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is no change there all right so</font>

244
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,220
this one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also no change there from</font>

245
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:04,400
the 01 energy to describe so each

246
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,400
attribute we propose what are the

247
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,900
mandatory optional

248
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,699
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV okay those also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reflect to the</font>

249
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,709
the identified in the previous slide so

250
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,990
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not nothing this just a table</font>

251
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,130
format to maybe is easy to read it for

252
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:23,050
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so next one please</font>

253
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:26,110
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new change that are we</font>

254
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,870
putting the revision<font color="#CCCCCC"> three the</font>

255
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,910
requirement we received from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there's</font>

256
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,340
probably three three are people on the

257
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,000
waiting list on in the meeting asking

258
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:41,170
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the map using existing IP six so we</font>

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,130
have this highlight here is Inga and not

260
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:50,849
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all assignments okay and</font>

261
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we have majority of the existing IP</font>

262
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,430
fix the element or IDs they are

263
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,170
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we only need to propose</font>

264
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:03,040
three more because we need stream of all

265
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:06,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">current is not defined about a prefix so</font>

266
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,180
we have this table<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show all the tvs</font>

267
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,990
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing as the radix extension</font>

268
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:17,469
and being embedded contained in these

269
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,680
attributes how to map one-to-one mapping

270
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,660
to the IP fixed element<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's</font>

271
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:29,709
very nice mapping here but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

272
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:33,640
point out in the IP fix there's a ip6

273
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:36,730
element ID which has the 16 bits number

274
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,449
all right and then the TRV in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the radius</font>

275
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,430
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 bits so we asking the INA to</font>

276
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,010
approve this proposal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mapping</font>

277
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,979
uniquely want you were mapping so that's

278
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,710
what because there's no way to

279
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:54,070
persisting page number in the TRV

280
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:56,890
defining the ecology of 69 29 so so this

281
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:00,100
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-to-one unique mapping that's</font>

282
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:05,859
what we are designed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is</font>

283
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:09,099
the major change and update to the to

284
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:12,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the draft according to to comment</font>

285
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:14,958
any questions so far so these studies is

286
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,069
a major right and also the highlight the

287
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,679
highlight at the three proposed

288
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:24,500
transport type net transporter limit the

289
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,470
last one local ID those we currently not

290
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:32,990
defined by the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP 6n that we</font>

291
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:35,600
propose to be added next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's</font>

292
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:39,440
just I'm so the recommendation for

293
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">ayanna will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define the value for</font>

294
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,830
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three elements yes inside the egg</font>

295
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,890
beater yes I fix which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to do</font>

296
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:52,039
with the radix yeah so the so those

297
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:56,120
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPP proposed to be attitude IP</font>

298
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:59,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vic's okay and then I ones being added</font>

299
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,449
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a TR v defining the radix</font>

300
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:05,600
and the pond ature<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so one</font>

301
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,669
one-to-one map he is unique right so we

302
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,320
define because you know what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiv</font>

303
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,419
peeing approve you have to assign them

304
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,879
for anyway right and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers are</font>

305
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:16,070
unique and it seems unique then one

306
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,490
notch is Pawn to another set of unique

307
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,289
number which is defined about IP fixed

308
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:26,299
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that's clear concept there</font>

309
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so ok next one so this just a</font>

310
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:34,490
show are in order to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work then</font>

311
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:39,470
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I am NOT the</font>

312
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:42,289
what I think the total 811 TVs defined

313
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,559
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 440 radix extension to support</font>

314
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:48,049
the three extended attributes and then

315
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:51,230
also the reference in the document where

316
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,620
those TRV being described and then in

317
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,570
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a port type theory then</font>

318
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,959
those are there's five different values

319
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:02,840
that right tcp UDP port plus ICMP

320
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,510
identify or<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP UDP port or TCP follow</font>

321
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,090
me or UDP polymerizing ICMP our

322
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,450
environment so those things are waiting

323
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:15,320
for once the last call being you know

324
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">pass and then submit to the isg then</font>

325
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,659
those things are being waiting to the

326
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,419
coupon inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so this one</font>

327
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,910
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that we are asking why</font>

328
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">not you approve the next one case the</font>

329
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,330
next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a freezing to be talking</font>

330
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and that those three things have</font>

331
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:35,540
nothing to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ratings is just</font>

332
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:39,500
solely added to the IP fix and then two

333
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,750
besties define describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pot device</font>

334
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,150
right so we and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a few</font>

335
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,250
more things right and then notice that

336
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,800
in the current IP fix to the database

337
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,530
they already have net the net related

338
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,379
the parameters there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay like a stop on</font>

339
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint right so here is a limit</font>

340
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:00,290
then it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in the same</font>

341
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,060
category and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

342
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a difficult to commit</font>

343
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,270
people this is important because you

344
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:09,980
know you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have some of the</font>

345
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:12,440
parameters already familiar defined and

346
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,860
that divides the<font color="#CCCCCC"> port device behavior</font>

347
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,350
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one more okay and and then</font>

348
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,409
because the net divides the port device

349
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,120
you operating on the on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipe a</font>

350
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:27,860
transport a port ID right so you have to

351
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,000
tell people what the pop rap either you

352
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,669
have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> port number right there</font>

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,710
you have tcp UDP you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier and</font>

354
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:37,420
then currently in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that divides the</font>

355
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,980
portavoz de or handle in you know in a

356
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,380
uniform way but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be better</font>

357
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,060
to tell maybe some operate they want to

358
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,210
know what's a different cell so this is

359
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:50,030
I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> wishing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dia is making</font>

360
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,610
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eddie's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off also there ok so</font>

361
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,430
those three things are the suggestion

362
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,800
children are to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be added to the IP fix</font>

363
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,530
have nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the radix but</font>

364
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,629
however once being added to IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> vix then</font>

365
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:06,520
we have a map winter when mapping

366
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,520
between base and then it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> chip</font>

367
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:18,000
Thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete oh yeah question oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

368
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">right sorry I mean I'm just really</font>

369
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,030
nervous baby all right anyway so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

370
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,309
the that's it and introduction to what

371
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,240
being changing the revision<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

372
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:32,910
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just has</font>

373
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,760
been adopted for a year right and then

374
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,740
since then almost every meeting and then

375
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,590
on the mend is there are there being

376
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,640
comments and every time the comments are

377
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:48,570
being provided we changed the dress

378
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,540
accordingly and I was completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> say who</font>

379
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,299
comes in to say all the problem you got

380
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:59,629
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors think that graphically</font>

381
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,629
stable and we request<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the year</font>

382
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:10,700
thank you so question regarding the

383
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:16,000
draft of the presentation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the</font>

384

other in the room who had with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> brat</font>

385
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:24,590
this version<font color="#CCCCCC"> or previous version anyway</font>

386
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:28,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay because one for myself I instance</font>

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,470
have not read the latest version so

388
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:37,000
especially specifically the mapping

389
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:37,000
between Kelly and I'd be fixed elements

390
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:44,450
so this draft was submitting into every

391
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:47,600
rights ever yeah and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

392

food it's based on the 01 02 inches

395
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,550
refresh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't make change because we</font>

396
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,290
don't want to be expired right though he

397
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:08,000
had a lot of comments on the

398
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:10,010
01 packs and then there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> another name</font>

399
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,530
is also talking about same thing he's

400
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,410
suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly suggesting uses IP</font>

401
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:18,920
fix pediment instead of define<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own</font>

402
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">thfe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so well that being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> King</font>

407
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Sam's started typing in when we get</font>

408
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:39,080
to bigger packets and I'm waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

409
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest to come it was what was so this</font>

410
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,510
is when we get the bigger package so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

411
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">think he wasn't done right right after</font>

412
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,980
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good bracket that's all offense</font>

413
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:53,840
when we get to bigger package right

414
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:56,660
after some thank you sorry I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

415
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,179
ad mm mm Oh problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting up to speed</font>

416
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,180
says as an x 10 x topic

417
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,410
Oh

418
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,050
you

419
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,790
there's no one in the ribs was kind of

420
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,620
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to do it plus everything</font>

421
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:25,870
else cool sam says we discussed the need

422
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,360
for protocol error code at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font>

423
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">meaning text was proposed there was a</font>

424
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,500
review on list and those were new

425
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,030
comments were addressed I believe the

426
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,700
draft is ready to working with last

427
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:39,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">call-thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but this one is for the</font>

428
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,800
other draft right for the ledger I guess

429
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay oh yeah I'll sandwich draft is this</font>

430
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,060
for just to be clear

431
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:57,779

432
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:03,809
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that it is for is draft</font>

he's drunk bigger target yeah so someone

434
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:08,190
we will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with this draft right</font>

435
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:11,789
after for the time being we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still on</font>

436
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,249
the IP port configuration and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

437
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:16,679
have one at this one comment regarding

438
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:18,899
the iron allocation process for the IP

439
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,529
fix element I should check what kind of

440
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:25,199
procedure is defined for the allocation

441
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,929
of value for IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed elements is it's</font>

442
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,229
an expert review or there is a need for

443
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:38,220
specific draft application requesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

444

<font color="#E5E5E5">you mean how that works how the you saw</font>

445
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,349
how the new IP fix element yes in

446
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:47,629
trouble how that works no no how they

447
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:53,129
are as a value from iono<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are allocated</font>

448
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:57,269
I don't go DJ but look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RCE</font>

449
00:25:53,129 --> 00:26:00,238
itself it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 piece number and</font>

450
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:02,849
then sequentially and you have to

451
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:06,239
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number there and then you have</font>

452
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:10,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a syntax I mean for the somatic</font>

453
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:13,590
what it means yeah but it's all 70

454
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:16,470
expert review ok so it's there is no

455
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,209
need for I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can I think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would i will double</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check but i</font>

457
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,979
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we can rely on this</font>

458
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,529
draft to say we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we don't need a</font>

459
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:28,279
specific action regarding IP fix just

460
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:28,279

466
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,690
amazing that's the only thing that would

467
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,659
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> required is an expert review to say</font>

468

473
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,159
no it was not something it was not a

474
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,150
limitation it was just to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

475
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:18,350
process on on how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> value for IP fix</font>

476
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:21,559
elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have a comment from</font>

477
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,360
from Stefan things that this document is

478
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,690
ok for working group last poll I think

479
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the main so i will review also this</font>

480
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,679

481
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">document to provide comment but it could</font>

482
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,350
be done along the working group last

483
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,360
ball so it will at least fix a limiting

484
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:43,850
the time for review it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be two weeks</font>

485
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,350
a period so i will initiate the working

486
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:50,330
group last ball right after the ATF

487
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:53,419
meeting it is easier to manage the

488
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,159
process so and drink this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> alan will</font>

489
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,260
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able also to provide any additional</font>

490
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment ok and based on the output</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

491
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,950
this working group last call we will see

492
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,480
what to do if a revision is needed if a

493
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,540
new work google+ police need it and so

494
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,990
on if not we will submit it so we will

495
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,139
do the

496
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:16,710
the photo writer and I proposed the

497
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,710
documents for IHG submission<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font>

498
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:32,729
so this one is down so it was for IP

499
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:35,880
port configuration and reporting so the

500
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">next one in line is the one from Sam's</font>

501
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">those larger packets for Reggie's over</font>

502
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP so we have received already the</font>

503
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,720
comment from San so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the nominees</font>

504
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,590
are right now on the driver room saying

505
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:52,860
that these documents is tabled for him I

506
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,340
captures all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment receipt so far</font>

507
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,840
so the proposal would be to go for

508
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,309
working with law school also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

509
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,720
one so we can we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> enhance this</font>

510
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:07,710
working group last ball for both

511
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,809
document at the same time and and I

512
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,799
don't know if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is any question or</font>

513
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:19,220
or concern about launching this working

514
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,220
group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall no questions or comments</font>

515
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:29,720
at least in the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> tight EF meetings</font>

516
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:31,889
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're happy with the content</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

517
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,539
there with some willingness to push

518
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:36,418
forward this document so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it is a</font>

519
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,039
longer what we have said so we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

520
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:42,110
through the working group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> poll and</font>

521
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll see the result of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this process</font>

522
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:49,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font>

523
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:53,910
this is down for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with glass</font>

524
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:57,150
bowl now along<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a new charter</font>

525
00:29:53,910 --> 00:30:00,030
proposal there is positon being

526
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:02,220
individual draft and we have three of

527
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:05,790
them so we have the dynamic

528
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:09,690
authorization proxying proposed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> alan</font>

529
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:11,970
and it is proposing the new charter to

530
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">had this document as a working good</font>

531
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:19,860
document for submission as a solid track

532
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:21,930
RFC in november this year saying that

533
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,550
this document is stable and it just

534
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs a review and to agree on the</font>

535
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:32,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">contents so no reaction since the last</font>

536
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,980
meeting but with the proposed the text

537
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:39,020
photo chatter was a new charter as a

538
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason going discussion between between</font>

539
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,910
Peter and Alan on what should be the

540
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,510
contents the exact content of this

541
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">document or of the other the work item</font>

542
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:58,950
for the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group things that the</font>

543
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,330
initial attempt from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan was to rely on</font>

544
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">an operator</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name ID just to be able to</font>

545
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,800
perform the procedure and warming so I

546
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,410
will not go through the details but

547
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,310
Peter seems to think that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

548
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:16,080
provide also more information regarding

549
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:18,570
kind of estate management in the proxy

550
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,860
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub controversy on that so</font>

551
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:25,350
we will see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the output of</font>

552
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:27,629
that I don't know if there is any

553
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:31,459
reaction on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ongoing discussion on de</font>

554
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:39,080
minimis know

555
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:41,120
so I think that's it's not so it means

556
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,330
that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something to do I think</font>

557
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that at least in the radix working group</font>

558
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,490
so I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this document the</font>

559
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,279
work item is ok for the working group I

560
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,990
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be it is also key to</font>

561
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:57,049
rely on this document as a working group

562
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:00,320
as a base for discussion and to progress

563
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:03,740
this raft as a working group document

564
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,010
and if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something to change I</font>

565
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:10,730
think it could be based on proposal and

566
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:13,879
comment on the current text and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

567
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:15,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">top so it will be at least my proposal I</font>

568
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,559
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Stefan could be also in line</font>

569
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,730
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this proposal I don't know if it's</font>

570
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,730
reacting as a javelin

571
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:37,990
just step on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street broad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

572
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the text in the proposed charter seems</font>

573
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:47,950
contentious I'm sure we can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

574
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:50,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">around it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you so after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

575
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:55,180
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the document on the correct use</font>

576
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:56,650
of AP response identity so we have this

577
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">case this document several time</font>

578
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,690
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the last meeting it was</font>

579
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,270
agreed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on so this document was</font>

580
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:07,270
not updated but from Stefan point of

581
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:09,639
view it can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> also as a basis for</font>

582
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,830
future work so we can rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

583
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,990
document as a working good document and

584
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:17,139
to provide the comments on this document

585
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:22,210
and to see how to progress this document

586
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:24,640
for work the it is proposed after a

587
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,220
discussion in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> triple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a director</font>

588
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,560
right here so expertly regulate I don't

589
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">even remember the name but it was</font>

590
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,370
proposed to have a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp because</font>

591
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,800
this one will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be used only for</font>

592
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:39,389
radius will be used for diabetic word

593
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:45,550
sense and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also for anyone relying on the</font>

594
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:48,880
on this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah def con sesh</font>

595
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:53,399
waiting for my dog update until after we

596
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good</font>

597
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:01,908
so I think this was mainly already

598
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:06,379
discussed at the last meeting I think it

599
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:07,789
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of the new charter that's it</font>

600
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:09,379
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do I liked what's happened</font>

601
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:13,460
for this document and the last one is

602
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data types so from our point of view</font>

603
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,109
the document is stable enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used</font>

604
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:22,040
also as a working<font color="#CCCCCC"> two documents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

605
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,960

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,989
comments received so far no new comments

607
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,550
were received that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on on the</font>

608
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:31,489
current document as a working group

609
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,200
document and it is proposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on</font>

610
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:41,149
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> document to have an informational</font>

612
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:51,549
on these three documents there is no

613
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:51,549
question comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font>

614
00:34:53,168 --> 00:35:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">will go home with this via the general</font>

615
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,550
the whole set of slides from the work

616
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,300
wheelchair we had the discussion

617
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:11,050
regarding an avatar on the arrestee<font color="#E5E5E5"> 51</font>

619
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:18,859
this is the dominica to recession

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:22,240
documents so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll and proposed to so I</font>

621
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:24,859
light a mistake in the documents

622
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,509
regarding the presence of the error code

623
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:34,450
that we ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause attribute other so</font>

624
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:37,670
for Sierra crest or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hispanic request and</font>

625
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:41,180
it was said that if the Act also the

626
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:44,299
error codes could be there and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

627
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,308
was agreed by by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bernard and Stefano</font>

628
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:49,400
slicing than a double that is the fun

629
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:53,030
and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not raised also the fact</font>

630
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,710
that if we correct the section 336 to

631
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,680
clarify that the error<font color="#CCCCCC"> code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

632
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:00,520
also present in the act we need also to

633
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,149
update the text in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the section 3 dot Phi</font>

634
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:09,770
2 Phi Phi that this error codes may now

635
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:13,220
be included also in the coa coa ack and

636
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:15,650
disconnect act<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets so I think it's</font>

637
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,020
it was agreed by their nod<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan</font>

638
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stephanie sake also with that and I'm</font>

639
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:27,589
okay with that i think that the only

640
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:31,190
issue was to how to learn so if only one

641
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:32,990
errata or two errata where needed for

642
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,849
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed and stefan and i</font>

643
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">propose to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have two different errata so</font>

644
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,540
to keep the first one proposed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> alan</font>

645
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,308
and to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new one I think it was</font>

646
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,440
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan anyway let's</font>

647
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:43,910
recheck the second one this is Kathleen

648
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,849
Moore area so the second once they had

649
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:49,819
already I have to check there is a set

650
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:51,650
of avatar a finish on this one so I

651
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:53,839
don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new one was related to</font>

652
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,790
this one or but actually the proposal

653
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,400
would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an errata for the</font>

654
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:01,170
clarification on the text or the section

655
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">325</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree that's easier so</font>

656
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,720
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and just let me know when</font>

657
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're ready and I'll go in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

658
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,058
careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them okay thanks for the</font>

659
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,640
reading so possible obviously for the

660
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:21,710
road for the bullet raja statues<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

661
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:21,710
verified no comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

662
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:31,410
so now we go to the discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

663
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:32,730
revision<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the shuttle I don't know if</font>

664
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:40,799
you have checked but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current set</font>

670
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,000
between diameter and radius and we have

00:37:53,130 --> 00:38:00,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of thing already done for instance</font>

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,850
attribute space extension the wireless

00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:10,110
LAN attributes the new transport and so

674

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a new text was proposed two weeks</font>

opponent<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sorry Friday yeah so please</font>

681
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:40,880
comment the proposed text there is an

682
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,879
ongoing discussion regarding as i said

683
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,970
the proxy as a make any

684
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:50,460
possibility mechanism but his commands

685
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,850
the other part of the documents as a pro

686
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:57,600
shutter and here you have an eye light

687
00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:00,299
of what could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will not go through</font>

688
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,810
the text but mainly to fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying now</font>

689
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:08,780
that everything related to graduate

690
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,779
diameter extensibility is removed

691
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,730
actually i'm not even sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have</font>

692
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,490
captured the right package the idea was

693
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove what would remove but i think</font>

694
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:27,410
that points<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the second section was</font>

695
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:30,030
removed but i would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

696
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,549
think that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main point also would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

697
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,940
to recap<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work as a proposed work</font>

698
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:38,340
items so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said we have the CR proxy</font>

699
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,000
and there is an ongoing discussion on

700
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,820
the text here the main comment receipt

701
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,340
so far is the fact that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not we</font>

702
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,650
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not describe how the</font>

703
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,420
mechanism will be provided and wine

704
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:55,980
stands here to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we will use the</font>

705
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,990
operator name I set by Stefan I think

706
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,970
that we can live as I with the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

707
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,069
proposed tax for that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

708
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:06,810
will not change the purpose of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

709
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:10,140
item and and we are working also even

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,730
working also<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the rules for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the EAP</font>
