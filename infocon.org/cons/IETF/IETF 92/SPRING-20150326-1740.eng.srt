2
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:08,300
there somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> present who would be so</font>

3
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:12,890
kind as to capture notes for us I see a

4
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,910
hand thank you very much Rob and if

5
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,529
anybody wants to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jabbar and bring</font>

6
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,640
anything to the mic that would be cake

7
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,410
but we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hold up the</font>

8
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,970
meeting for it so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour to</font>

9
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,160
get a fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount done so let's get</font>

10
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:34,970
started first<font color="#CCCCCC"> order of business welcome</font>

11
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:39,500
to Bruno who's already been very

12
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:43,130
productive as a co-chair the note well

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,650
which you've no doubt already noted well

14
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:51,200
but yet we still should keep it in mind

15
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,140
in particular we were recently reminded

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,200
by the six-man people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PR</font>

17
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,970
disclosures early and often are very

18
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,540
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know maintain good</font>

19
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:12,200
relations with all our neighbors so we

20
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:15,078
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway right so we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

21
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:20,238
some about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter how we're making</font>

22
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:23,630
progress towards it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

23
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,000
spent some time Bruno and I spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

24
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,519
time looking at our actually quit large

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,989
zoo of drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have and trying to</font>

26
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how are we going to make</font>

27
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:36,950
progress towards progressing springs

28
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,320
charter and what happens next so here's

29
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,820
a few quotations from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

30
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:49,310
Charter and we took them and tried to

31
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:51,290
map the drafts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have or map these</font>

32
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,400
you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of high-level this is what</font>

33
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:59,048
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are chartered to do items on to our</font>

34
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,250
milestones in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter and on to the</font>

35
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,489
drafts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have either already had</font>

36
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,670
adopted as working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group items</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

37
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:09,110
individual drafts that appeared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font>

38
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,140
that they may be can

39
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,690
dates for satisfying one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or more of</font>

40
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,940
those working group items I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

41
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,858
point out that that there's been there

42
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,380
are other draft some that were brought

43
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:24,049
quite early some that are continuing to

44
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,400
arrive that while they may be you know

45
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:32,470
very good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know laudable work</font>

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,150
don't actually advance our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter and</font>

47
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,190
what you'll find is that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

48
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,349
say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're really hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,600
focus on the Charter we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping to</font>

50
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,850
focus on advancing the Charter this

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
means adopting sort of the minimum

52
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessary set of documents to move the</font>

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,130
work forward and not possibly every

54
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,690
single draft that's that some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

55
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,159
in existence and that's not met is in

56
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,530
any way as a judgment of anybody as

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:03,800
anybody's work this happens in the ITF

58
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:06,409
all the time so our first point from the

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,060
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Charter is we charter to</font>

60
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,160
identify and evaluate use cases for

61
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,870
spring they must include a definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,340
the data plane for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the environment in</font>

63
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,890
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed and then</font>

64
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:20,210
we have a milestone you'll note that

65
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,849
many of these now are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

66
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,560
despite our best intentions so one of

67
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,560
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chairs will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font>

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,200
fairly soon is going and putting new

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,570
dates on the milestones that are in the

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">future one or more documents describing</font>

71
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:40,640
spring use cases so we have obviously

72
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,620
three adopted working group items and

73
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,650
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other use cases</font>

74
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,690
listed here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide I</font>

75
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,729
didn't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it but you know we just</font>

76
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">made our best effort at bidding these</font>

77
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,500
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if we got something wrong</font>

78
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,109
you know tell us now or later or

79
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever and we'll fix it um this is</font>

80
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,650
just our kind of first pass at

81
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:08,360
rationalizing the Charter and the

82
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:10,039
milestones right so of these on you no

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,500
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement is kind of the big one</font>

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,660
and we did complete a working group last

85
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,020
call and we were awaiting a couple of

86
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,449
administrative things and you know

87
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,490
I don't wish to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault with anyone</font>

88
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,569
at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> although you know if there's a</font>

89
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,710
fault to be found and it doesn't get

90
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,590
anyone else I suppose it goes to the

91
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,349
chair so there we go Mia Maxima culpa

92
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,758
for not chasing down the necessary

93
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,210
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying you know we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

94
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,680
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get all the IPR statements</font>

95
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,919
made and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the necessary</font>

96
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,379
revisions made I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know we</font>

97
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">are now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on track to have this done</font>

98
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,340
fairly soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some there's a</font>

99
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:50,009
document update necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stefano has</font>

100
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,729
the comments and says that he's you know

101
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:55,080
just probably on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his flight home he'll</font>

102
00:06:53,729 --> 00:07:00,120
have plenty of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> with his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text editor</font>

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,979
I just made that<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then the kind</font>

104
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of big item because I had to break it</font>

105
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,349
into two slides is the second thing from

106
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,180
the Charter data plate encodings so we

107
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,590
charted for definition of requirements

108
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,630
for any new data plan encodings and

109
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,940
procedures required to implement the use

110
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,490
cases procedures must include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

111
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,110
necessary security considerations so we

112
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,710
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level abstract</font>

113
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:26,789
architecture that's adopted and then

114
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,620
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got several na is here requirement</font>

115
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">for modifications to mpls architecture</font>

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,469
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're basically are none</font>

117
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,680
requirements for modifications to v6

118
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:43,349
architecture I i will say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,349
anyway it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> either are none or there</font>

120
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:52,139
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> there captured in the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font>

121
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:53,759
architectural document let's see a

122
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,710
specification of any required new

123
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,449
procedures to support spring use cases

124
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,690
we have nothing mapped into that right

125
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,610
now one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> more data plane extension</font>

126
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,770
requirements documents including

127
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,840
documenting the impact on existing

128
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:11,490
deployments of the existing and data

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,080
plans yeah so to some extent these

130
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,520
requirements are<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe implicit in the</font>

131
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,130
architecture and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data plan extension</font>

132
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,840
documents and then we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this other</font>

133
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:28,259
small pile of drafts that that may be

134
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:30,299
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be applicable control plane so this</font>

135
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite such a wall of text but</font>

136
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
definition of requirements and if

137
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,440
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomb</font>

138
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,059
control plane mechanism needed to enable

139
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,590
the use cases so extensions requirements

140
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:45,420
documents gosh we just jumped right<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

141
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:48,330
that and have a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of documents</font>

142
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,920
in virtually well maybe not quit every

143
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,050
other routing working group but a lot of

144
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,760
other grouting<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups and I</font>

145
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,469
think that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we'll have</font>

146
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,360
to do is decide which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these we're</font>

147
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,610
tracking as<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group items because</font>

148
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,930
what we tentatively agreed to do is that

149
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,250
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create new</font>

150
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group items for any of these</font>

151
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,730
milestones we're just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say look</font>

152
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,530
over there in is is they're doing

153
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">segment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writing extensions will track</font>

154
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,870
that once we've cleared you know is is

155
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">and ospf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatever else we decide to</font>

156
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,900
track then we will say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our our</font>

157
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,580
milestone is complete and definition of

158
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,170
requirements and if necessary management

159
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">plane mechanisms needed to manage and</font>

160
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate a spring enabled network so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

161
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,829
have notably no adopted<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

162
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,900
drafts here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to say do we</font>

163
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,690
have even any working group drafts in

164
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,180
any working group I don't think so this

165
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">is probably going to need to be a focus</font>

166
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:53,390
going forward not in this meeting but

167
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:56,070
you know soon then where we have a

168
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,050
milestone for documenting interworking

169
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">coexistence between new procedures and</font>

170
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,599
existing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you know how do we</font>

171
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,969
deploy this thing we do again have some

172
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,460
work that exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> here again it's not</font>

173
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopted as working group items and again</font>

174
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,020
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply some focus</font>

175
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:19,710
on this in a future meeting not this one

176
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:25,319
and then this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah almost the last</font>

177
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:27,360
slide um and we're almost on time so we

178
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,660
the initial data plans to be considered

179
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">are mpls and v6 and so far the only and</font>

180
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I kind of hope the initial and complete</font>

181
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:45,850
set of data plans because that's enough

182
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:49,600
so that these two v6 related drafts were

183
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:52,360
presented to six men on Monday Bruno and

184
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,300
I just finished having a meeting with

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,240
the six-man chairs and the relevant ad

186
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,640
is to talk about you know what's our way

187
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,850
forward and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed and you know</font>

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,930
the six-man chair said well look guys we

189
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,510
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that your</font>

190
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,910
architecture is well enough nailed that

191
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,610
it's not going to shift under us if we

192
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,839
start adopting this routing header<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

193
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,310
you've brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us you know we don't</font>

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,560
want to adopt a routing header and then

195
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,349
find out that nobody really<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what</font>

196
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,579
it's for so give us some confidence that

197
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,100
you know what this routing header of

198
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,740
yours is for said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how shall we</font>

199
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,350
accomplish that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we agreed to is</font>

200
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,990
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture document shall be</font>

201
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,180
last called you know cross last called

202
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,820
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> six man so that six man can give it</font>

203
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,439
some review and be aware that that it's

204
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,400
gone it's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> through our is going</font>

205
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:46,480
through last call subsequently the v6

206
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:53,590
extension documents themselves shall be

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">done in six man but um it is important</font>

208
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know crucially</font>

209
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,590
important for anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this group that</font>

210
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,730
cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the v6 data plane and</font>

211
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:05,940
how its specified to participate on you

212
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,330
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the six-man list and meetings</font>

213
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:14,890
because it's not there you know general

214
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:16,510
bailiwick and well hopefully the reasons

215
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,410
are obvious why and why your attention

216
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:24,130
is necessary so no sign up for the

217
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:26,100
mailing list now why don't you so what's

218
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,540
our plan moving forward we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

219
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,400
update the milestones we need to work on

220
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,760
mapping the you know figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

221
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,860
what drafts are going to maybe fit

222
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,720
underneath which milestones this may

223
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,420
also then turn into a bunch of working

224
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,570
group adoption requests though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

225
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,099
that probably the first thing for the

226
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,570
the group as a whole to focus attention

227
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,160
on is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

228
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:57,010
the architecture document<font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance</font>

229
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:59,459
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the v6 work um yeah and I</font>

230
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that I pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much talked over all</font>

231
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,520
the rest of this so we're now three

232
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,730
minutes behind where i was hoping to be

233
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will invite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stefano to come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

234
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,030
talk about where we are with the working

235
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,030
group drafts

236
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:31,489
okay hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody my name is Stefano a</font>

237
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:35,449
small update on the different segments

238
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:38,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing drafts what do we have there the</font>

239
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:41,628
main one called the the architecture

240
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:46,309
draft which has been updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

241
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:49,729
last comment that we received we didn't

242
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:54,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">get any other comment or claims after</font>

243
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:57,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so I suppose is and ready to go the</font>

244
00:13:54,949 --> 00:14:03,079
use case is I think it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been updated</font>

245
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:06,549
recently with some minor stop there so

246
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:11,269
it's also pretty stable as John said

247
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:13,100
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the different ipv6 segments</font>

248
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,439
rotting draft the protocol extensions

249
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,410
are being discussed now in six-man<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

250
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,988
finally we got some discussions there so

251
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,129
feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join the six-month waiting</font>

252
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:28,519
list to contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the discussion the</font>

253
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:32,029
routing mpls segment run again pls data

254
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:36,189
plane a no change is pretty stable

255
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:39,409
probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some clean up just to</font>

256
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:43,748
refresh some sections but mostly the

257
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:49,459
content didn't change so it's also

258
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:52,179
pretty ready to go for last call same

259
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:56,149
for the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> statement except that</font>

260
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:58,939
there are a bunch of comments my fault

261
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,699
that slipped away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my to-do list so</font>

262
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:04,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have to update it comments from from</font>

263
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:10,608
<font color="#CCCCCC">alvaro so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after this this round it</font>

264
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:13,300
should be also quite stable the

265
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:16,959
resiliency use case

266
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:21,579
I think he didn't change but please for

267
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:28,599
the last four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months so this is pretty</font>

268
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:31,329
much it<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks the reason I yeah so the</font>

269
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">big one is the segment writing use cases</font>

270
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:36,719
draft that in fact it has been the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

271
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,939
segment rotting drop that we submitted a

272
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,070
little while ago and that contains the

273
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,540
description of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use cases that we</font>

274
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,050
want to address<font color="#CCCCCC"> with segment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing and</font>

275
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,699
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address them with segment writing</font>

276
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,000
then part of the content of the use

277
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,250
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft has been used and moved into</font>

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem statement draft so there is</font>

279
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,890
quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of text application in the</font>

00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">use cases job that needs rework and</font>

281
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,339
clean up but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sections that are</font>

282
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,459
pretty useful I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

283
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,500
kept somewhere especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

284
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:14,109
description on how to use segment

<font color="#E5E5E5">rotting for traffic engineering and this</font>

286
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:21,550
section will probably I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

287
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,250
rework<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bit refresh the draft</font>

288
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,770
probably renamed draft to be more

289
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,110
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> to traffic engineering but we</font>

290
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,640
would like this drive to go to the to

291
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,850
the publication<font color="#CCCCCC"> process so we will</font>

292
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,529
resubmit it as a segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> riding traffic</font>

293
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:41,020

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:45,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the segment writing out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP</font>

295
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,110
interrupt<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft very stable describes</font>

296
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:52,180
how to interrupt between segments

297
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:57,550
running and lgp the protocol extensions

298
00:16:52,180 --> 00:17:00,219
of doing this are described in the ospf

299
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,829
and is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts we have multiple</font>

300
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,270
implementations and are also

301
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:10,089
interoperable surprisingly but yeah so

302
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,790
clearly dead draft the authors would

303
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,839
like now to see the adoption as working

304
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,780
group item because it really represents

305
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,629
the use case and reality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

306
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,829
implementations

307
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:29,909
then we have the two bgp based<font color="#E5E5E5"> segments</font>

308
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:33,580
riding crop ems DC and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> central</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EPE</font>

309
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:36,520
both described only the use cases and in

310
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,168
IDR we have the corresponding protocol

311
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,830
extensions drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefect's eight</font>

312
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:45,549
when draft and the BG pls extensions for

313
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:48,399
EPA and the on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we receive</font>

314
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">little coins there are pretty stable I</font>

315
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,969
think there are pretty good candidate

316
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,990
for adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we can provide them as</font>

317
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:59,470
well so that's what we request and

318
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,539
finally the segment routing tilf a which

319
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the second writing solution for the</font>

320
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:07,450
resiliency the resiliency use case being

321
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:12,190
obviously described in a different

322
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,779
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know i mean the talking</font>

323
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:18,250
with the chairs we have to decide if

324
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:21,789
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the tilf a</font>

325
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,220
draft or should it be moved to the

326
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:27,070
rotting area working group I don't know

327
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,649
yeah so i can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

328
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,149
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jeff and he thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

329
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:33,789
rotting area would be an appropriate

330
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:36,549
place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think both of us think so</font>

331
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:39,190
too so fine if that's you know unless

332
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:45,668
anybody has any objection that would be

333
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:50,620
where we would suggest pursuing it so in

334
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion we would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP</font>

335
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:59,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">interop the BGP second rotting drafts</font>

adopted as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> working through Python</font>

337
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,059
yeah so of course we'll do that on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

338
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,289
list Rob if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't mind noting</font>

339
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,668
that in the minutes though so we don't

340
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,950
like so don't walk out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of here and</font>

341
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:15,179
immediately forget thank you ok

342
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,179
questions thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

343
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,779
Greg

344
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:38,340
so this is update on our progress since

345
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:42,140
last ITF meeting we received very good

346
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:47,840
comments and appreciate input from law

347
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,840
we work together with their authors of

348
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,950
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive that left and now welcome</font>

349
00:19:51,810 --> 00:20:01,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm a chat to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us and we added one use</font>

350
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:07,400
case and consideration for processing

351
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:11,879
return when there is a no requested

352
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:14,010
return path available next so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

353
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,410
more detailed description of that an

355
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:24,450
their return path to lv and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find there</font>

356
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:29,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">are two options that we suggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

357
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:33,480
option is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if far end follows RFC 58</font>

358
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:36,110
84 and establishes be the session

359
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,790
reverse direction over IP domain

360
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:47,459
according to 1580 a 58 84 it has an

361
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:51,000
option to use LSP echo reply to send

362
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,970
back report then we state that in that

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,730
case it may use a return code couldn't

364
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:03,630
find their reverse path to clarify the

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,810
situation if<font color="#CCCCCC"> their agris does not want</font>

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:16,440
establish return path over IP then it

introduced and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> boo sorry yeah I</font>

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,559
this letter

377
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:52,679
and they're interconnected as a ring I

378
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:57,990
can see through here no it's just yeah

379
00:21:52,679 --> 00:22:01,169
sorry it's a poor choice of graphics so

380
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:07,429
that is just illustrate that what we can

381
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:13,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">do because if we imagine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

382
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:18,929
tunnels ABCD g and h and then we have a

383
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:21,809
be e f g h and then we have tunnels in

384
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:25,860
reverse direction then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

385
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:31,110
monitoring of each in a bidirectional

386
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:37,879
carotid manner by instructing their note

387
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:37,879
a because we can do it for the same as

388
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:48,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">1584 that there could be multiple DFD</font>

389
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:51,590

391
00:22:51,590 --> 00:23:00,990
explicit return path till v we can

392
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:06,510
direct the return pad / h<font color="#E5E5E5"> GD c be a in</font>

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:10,140
first sanara and hgf be a in the second

394
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:12,690
case so it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already made the</font>

395
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,610
presentation and mpls working group and

396
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,610
ask for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group adoption and</font>

397
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:21,059
so it's will be considering it probably

398
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,189
hopefully by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague will have a new</font>

399
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:30,918
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group documented mpls working</font>

400
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,919
group comments always welcome

401
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,840
thank you

402
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:51,040
hi folks so the talk is about segment

403
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:55,120
routing yang<font color="#E5E5E5"> model so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can skip to</font>

404
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,889
next slide yeah good so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

405
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,550
horrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> model shows that we are</font>

406
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:03,040
currently proposing so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise</font>

407
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:05,409
both the configuration and operational

408
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,120
state for segment routing here you can

409
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a view of e of our global</font>

410
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,060
configuration and the interesting

411
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,050
discussion we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are expecting is that</font>

412
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,810
today in our implementation at least at

413
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,879
I know we segment routing configuration

414
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,760
is part of your routing protocol so I

415
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,350
say I saw ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what's existing today</font>

416
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:32,770
and main point is is it the right design

417
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:35,469
and based on some descriptions that we

418
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,720
had which in the quarters we don't think

419
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,700
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right design because if you</font>

420
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:46,480
have a network which is composed of

421
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:50,200
multiple protocols bgp or or mixing ospf

422
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:54,280
an IAS or whatever some parameter sounds

423
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,880
critical to be global and especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

424
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:02,379
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> g a second routing global block</font>

425
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:05,020
so a salad so we are proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a segment</font>

426
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,810
routing model that is directly attached

427
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,020
to the cohousing model with routing

428
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:14,560
instance so we can also discussed if is

429
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,470
this segment halting model must be

430
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,200
stagnant rotting model be attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

431
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,870
the housing instance or is it also more

432
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,270
chassis wide a configuration this is

433
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:28,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we need also to to</font>

434
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:30,610
discuss so you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so we are able</font>

435
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to configure with cheaper smtp we are</font>

436
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:36,100
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure what we are calling</font>

437
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:39,639
the mapping server so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example SNL</font>

438
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,919
DPI in top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the transport type</font>

439
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,940
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this standard model we are</font>

440
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,430
proposing only NP RS as a data plan for

441
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the moment but if someone wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

442
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:56,809
this fancy ipv6 it can

443
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:00,070
it's using foundation next time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

444
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:05,860
take questions now or oh can you wait oh

445
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,860
oh good

446
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,020
good

447
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,499
hmm do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do you think you may need can</font>

448
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:49,399
sleep on the back of the room tell me it

449
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:50,839
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic picking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah okay do you</font>

450
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,389
think you will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise</font>

451
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:59,059
different entries if you have different

452
00:26:53,389 --> 00:27:01,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">I gp's a person nine point of view at</font>

453
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:03,379
least but maybe I'm wrong I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would try to</font>

454
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:06,320
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is consistent with</font>

455
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:09,228
in my housing so advertising exactly the

456
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:20,259
same binding we will all my routing

457
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:20,259
domains it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working or so come on</font>

458
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:29,299
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok no yes better so so my question</font>

459
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:32,059
is about associating this policy or

460
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,099
whatever the mapping server entry to the

461
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp is actually that's where you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

462
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:37,428
give a name so that you can easily

463
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:42,019
associate this whole thing in a

464
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:43,700
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> ijp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance hmm I can</font>

465
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,529
discuss off yeah maybe we can discuss

466
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,079
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure about what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

467
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:50,269
trying is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key to a she yeah let's to</font>

468
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:55,999
found my comment goes actually in the

469
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:58,609
same direction right i mean the mapping

470
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:01,629
server functionality can't could also

471
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:06,739
get implemented using routing policy

472
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:10,519
right think about it yes you care taking

473
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:13,489
ldpe rods<font color="#CCCCCC"> levi GP Rousey and essentially</font>

474
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:16,759
all what you have to do is to attach a

475
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:20,029
index to it and sort of feed it back to

476
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:24,289
the road needs it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

477
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:26,779
like this but not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementation</font>

478
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:29,289
are considering as<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp as a routing</font>

479
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,289
protocol

480
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:43,000
mapping server defines<font color="#CCCCCC"> the export policy</font>

481
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:45,930
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp cloud and I GP cloud or</font>

482
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">writes it ascends the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word policy here</font>

483
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:52,420
so Polly policy makes sense the main

484
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,220
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about when you are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

485
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,750
perform a housing policy within a

486
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,330
routing protocol you are interacting

487
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,850
between housing protocols and some

488
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,090
implementation are not considering<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp</font>

489
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:07,419
and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp as a routing protocol I see</font>

490
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:11,230
I see because<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but I agree about this</font>

491
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also be expressed as policy</font>

492
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,250
but there may be more suspicions but i'm

493
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,810
open to discuss about this configuration

494
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,010
probably we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk it offline but</font>

495
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:27,190
probably when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you define those mapping</font>

496
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:30,040
server table we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just give it a sort</font>

497
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:33,280
of a you know policy name default or

498
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:38,190
whatever and then all the vendors should

499
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,190
be able to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a home here why not ok</font>

500
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:49,120
so no<font color="#CCCCCC"> vision from javi one thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

501
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,950
wanted to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clarified in this model</font>

502
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,129
that either they see the subversive

503
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:59,710
fighter who configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noda all configure</font>

504
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:02,020
doujins unite configuring router to

505
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,210
perform segment royalty yeah i think the

506
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,639
data users they see the this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

507
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">objector</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to configure the second</font>

508
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,860
ruling on an older that's my right the

509
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,890
police is the this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mapping server</font>

510
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:17,860
you mean because i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the magnum</font>

511
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:23,050
server may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different object from</font>

512
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:25,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note no you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are same you</font>

513
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,220
are configuring the mapping server on an

514
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,070
odor where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to configure it</font>

515
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:37,810
because here there is a lot of a pending

516
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:39,669
of the prefix and this is a no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

517
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using the term mapping</font>

518
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,060
server differently hey see Linda I think

519
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font>

520
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,490
here if the node is not the mapping

521
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,639
server you don't configure it this is

522
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,200
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local this this network device</font>

523
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,660
in this routing instance because it

524
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,980
augments routing instance is the mapping

525
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:04,070
server it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an SR node segment</font>

526
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,620
routing note and the mapping server<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

527
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:09,530
so my question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so they are</font>

528
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,199
always matching server in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

529
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,629
segment and network if you don't need vs

530
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">ldp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interop you don't you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a</font>

531
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,120
no mapping server in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network or how</font>

532
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:24,350
to configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know the address to buy</font>

533
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,209
the in the second ID ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe so</font>

534
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,340
yeah I guess getting further questions

535
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:33,170
be held until the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the annotation</font>

536
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:34,939
place over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so this question</font>

537
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,220
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the segment routing</font>

538
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,780
configuration should be for each permit

539
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">offices some things that we need clearly</font>

540
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:46,060
two to discuss between our between us

541
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:49,340
next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interface</font>

542
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:51,700
configuration so within the interface we

543
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,860
have to kind of segment routing

544
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,430
parameters the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

545
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:02,510
end linger the adjacency<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment so do I</font>

546
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:05,270
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advertise this adjacency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

547
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:13,490
for forest interface and also the

548
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:15,020
ability to to to to to add this to

549
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,940
manage the different flags that we have

550
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,700
in the adjacency<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment so being able</font>

551
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,160
to say I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advertise the</font>

552
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:26,060
protection state for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjacency of</font>

553
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,250
saying I want to advertise both a

554
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,649
protected adjacency segment and an

555
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,530
unprotected adjacency segments we are

556
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:36,650
also providing some facilities to

557
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:39,590
perform bundling and advertising using

558
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:42,180
those OS flag

559
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,770
single adjacent segments that will be

560
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,820
shared by multiple interfaces to

561
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:50,100
facilitate via v load<font color="#E5E5E5"> balancing we are</font>

562
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,250
also proposing the configuration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

563
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:57,270
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment ID so for the prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

564
00:32:53,250 --> 00:33:00,990
is attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this interface we can we</font>

565
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:04,379
can configure a prefix it value we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

566
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,990
do it we propose to two flavors index or

567
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,600
absolute<font color="#CCCCCC"> values and we can also define</font>

568
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,640
is this perfect segment must be

569
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered as a nodal segment or if it's</font>

570
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:22,620
just a perfect segment for both ipv4 and

571
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:26,370
ipv6 next time so V bundling so this is

572
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really clear today</font>

573
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,800
in this specification we are defining in

574
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:36,240
the encoding the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s flag but we don't</font>

575
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">really know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so here we are</font>

576
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,490
doing some tapas all about how to use

577
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:47,160
this s flagon to<font color="#E5E5E5"> permit easier a</font>

578
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:50,270
bundling and facilitate ecmp so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

579
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:53,640
that we haven't we could discuss on is

580
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:56,340
to set a group ID four inch each

581
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,190
interface and also interface that will

582
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,980
be part of the same group ID in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font>

583
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the unique adjacency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> segments they</font>

584
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,940
will advertise a common adjacency

585
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">segments that will permit with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CMP</font>

586
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:16,860
next time so now in terms of protocol

587
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:18,929
extensions so we are defining here with

588
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,730
global second housing configuration but

589
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:23,699
then we must interact with routing

590
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,790
protocols to say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is is</font>

591
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:29,370
protocol I authorizing the advertisement

592
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:32,790
on V of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the segment house extensions so</font>

593
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:37,830
we are proposing here to augment is is

594
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:42,170
an ospf young model to to manage this

595
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:45,900
segment house in extensions next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

596
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:48,510
so here we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have also to discuss is</font>

597
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:51,090
it right way to do this or do you need

598
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to manage all the configuration directly</font>

599
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:56,430
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is an ospf</font>

600
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:58,560
modern currently we also have some

601
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:01,259
segments housing container we machine is

602
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,259
is because we don't really know a good

603
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:08,960
way to do it so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be up to a to</font>

604
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:11,790
discussion next time so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

605
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,390
operational state not really readable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

606
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,550
think but may so important<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that we</font>

607
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,730
are giving here is the ability to

608
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,340
monitor of usage of the SLV how many

609
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:27,080
labels are free are many labels are used

610
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:31,920
and also giving some information about

611
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:34,410
all the bindings that are currently in

612
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,360
use so bindings that may come from

613
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,899
mapping server and also bindings that

614
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:43,820
are they erected on from the perfect

615
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:47,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">segment for example we have also some</font>

616
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,980
very I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory for all of the</font>

617
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,859
operations notifications that will

618
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,830
permit to a left for example when you

619
00:35:52,860 --> 00:36:00,030
have some collision of<font color="#E5E5E5"> segments awesome</font>

620
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:03,569
stuff like that next time so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

621
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,280
step so this segment housing young model

622
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,940
is coming from discussions that we are

623
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,400
within ASI ES and ospf young mother so

624
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,310
most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are involved</font>

625
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,140
this work are coming from the ASI es no

626
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:21,390
SPF modern it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think accurate</font>

627
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,140
in terms of future compared to what is

628
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:28,350
shipped today in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> envy occasional cut</font>

629
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:31,710
it scary time to work on it because cars

630
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:35,850
are shown here just shipped or under

631
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:38,400
shipping so it's time now to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

632
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:41,400
think on a common way of configuration

633
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,750
for four segments routing so for sure

634
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,380
there is a lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font>

635
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:49,800
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> so via salvia scope out windows</font>

636
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,510
interactions with is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sno</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ospf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

637
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,390
we are clearly are welcoming all the

638
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,120
comments on this part to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

639
00:36:54,390 --> 00:37:00,839
are all in line on the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

640
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">accommodate and we are we think that</font>

641
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,619
this is already important

642
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,280
so we are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are working on</font>

643
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,200
production floor for this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

644
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,970
thanks any further questions or comments

645
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,230
please keep them short because we have a

646
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:18,720
short time in our agenda shut up from

647
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:21,000
juniper so I have one question on the

648
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,950
interface level convict I think you have

649
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,359
the interface level configs also in the

650
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:30,720
global model no no it's the same thing

651
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact it's your it's your article so</font>

652
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,750
you have the segment routing container

653
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:39,029
which is attached in the housing

654
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,650
instance and within this segment housing

655
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,210
container you have global parameters and

656
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,819
you have their interface parameter oh

657
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:48,210
yeah so I I think it's unusual to

658
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:50,700
configure interfaces at the segment

659
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,500
routing under global segment routing

660
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,379
option I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> more appropriate to</font>

661
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,770
have it under the protocols but which

662
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:01,440
protocol within<font color="#E5E5E5"> each protocol each so</font>

663
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,630
you may think that you will advertise

664
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,329
the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> segments I'd if you are</font>

665
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:10,520
for example ospf and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SAS and does the</font>

666
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:13,589
same interface could be I i I'm open but

667
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,609
for me did that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense so that's why</font>

668
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:19,430
I proposed this butter we can discuss to

669
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:21,869
me it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's unusual to do</font>

670
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,810
global configurations for interfaces

671
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:28,109
because you can you may consider that

672
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:30,569
segment routing as you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> also of our</font>

673
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:33,359
protocol need<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 it's not your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> house in</font>

674
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:40,319
Protagoras so kind of housing stuff soon

675
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:42,930
I saw I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Esiason way this is my uh okay</font>

676
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:45,270
yeah I just I'm sorry but we've got a

677
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,460
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that so no more people</font>

678
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:51,060
coming to the Lions please and keep your

679
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,950
comments relatively short go ahead let's

680
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,690
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from erickson so are you also</font>

681
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:57,210
planning to model any of the hardware

682
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,950
capabilities that I think the segment

683
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,990
routing in this model but maybe it

684
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,970
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting especially for we</font>

685
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:06,180
enthalpy<font color="#CCCCCC"> label stuff because if i see</font>

686
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:08,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pset yeah i see the pset yeah</font>

687
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:13,118
sectioning I see hardware capabilities

688
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,359
it might be useful in this morning okay

689
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:20,950
juniper so I'm a water in this but still

690
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:23,019
I think a container both at the global

691
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,769
as well as a protocol level will

692
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:28,450
actually suffice lot of usage say what

693
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:30,999
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say here is that you may</font>

694
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">have one configuration to global and do</font>

695
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:35,709
not put any confusion under protocol

696
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:37,269
level so all protocols take that but you

697
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:40,299
can overwrite that on a specific

698
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:41,979
protocol label in level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 so using</font>

699
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:44,200
Google's it would be quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to do ya</font>

700
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,119
I think that is a better model I think

701
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,700
you see what about cutting the lines

702
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,880
didn't you understand I'm an offer so

703
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,890
you can't well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right that is</font>

704
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,650
now we'll make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a container they could</font>

705
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:59,558
be augmented by a particular

706
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,630
implementation yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a ma from</font>

cannot put everything on the shore

716
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:25,348
completely agree thank you very much

765
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:52,460
also we define pastor Protection station

766
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:55,940
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the gizmodo design inside so</font>

my way<font color="#CCCCCC"> disturbed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some comments the first</font>

00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:22,970
with Sudan fought the first yonder

773
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:26,690
Hamato and staff oh and the AC so they

774
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:29,450
suggest that some of that too te r n8

<font color="#CCCCCC">the nose and the forwarding neighbor no</font>

776
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:36,720
sir should it be augmented from NPR CG

777
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:42,620
model or and he hasn't

778
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,620
order so I think agency is a reasonable

779
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:52,500
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the my first try in Yankee</font>

nimodo so many as innovation within two

781
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:59,600
more research in this area are based on

782
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:09,330
our category simply implementation so

783
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:12,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments so i have a comment for the</font>

784
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,860
authors of both drafts which is it it

785
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,040
doesn't seem likely to me that the

786
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:20,340
working group will ultimately adopt to

787
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,340
draft so if you know I I encourage you

788
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:27,810
all to<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh to work to improve one of the</font>

789
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:30,180
drafts and move it forward together so

790
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,220
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can take some time after the</font>

791
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,730
meeting or you know talk among

792
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,830
yourselves but I would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

793
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:40,790
find some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to move together with with</font>

794
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,790
one work if you can

795
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,770
sweet

796
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:59,859
no rear on this is the entropy label for

797
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:02,079
segment routing mpls trap so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> raft</font>

798
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:04,660
has just become a working group per

799
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,250
document in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPLS working group it's</font>

800
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,319
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks old as a</font>

801
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,059
working group document and I'm going to

802
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">update on the changes that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

803
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:15,550
since the last IETF so as a background

804
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:17,230
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is history for load balancing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

805
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:19,900
segments routing specifically for the

806
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:23,079
MPLS data plane and specifically it's

807
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,050
about how to use RFC 6790 which is the

808
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,750
entropy<font color="#CCCCCC"> level RFC for segment routing so</font>

809
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,369
the main change that we have done is

810
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:34,180
addressing the MPLS RT preview comments

811
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:35,500
ever a few of them outstanding and as a

812
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,328
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of addressing those what we have</font>

813
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,609
done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have changed a use case the</font>

814
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:41,170
previous version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the draft use the</font>

815
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:43,299
service training use case with service

816
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,309
seeds so we have changed that totally to

817
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,670
a traffic engineering use case using

818
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:51,069
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> node suits and adjacency sets and</font>

819
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:54,069
the readability of the sample algorithm

820
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:55,690
provided to compute where the entropy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Li</font>

821
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:57,819
and the eel needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> inserted has</font>

822
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:01,329
also been improved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the examples</font>

823
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:06,160
have been updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the new changes</font>

824
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:20,260
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is as bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

825
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:27,490
the previous one but slightly better not

826
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:29,349
really yeah so so I'll try my best so

827
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:31,470
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use case this is the</font>

828
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:35,970
topology for the use case where the

829
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:39,098
packet has to go from s to<font color="#CCCCCC"> D there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

830
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:42,160
parallel links between the lsr sp1 and

831
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:45,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">p3 as well as ecmp paths between p2 and</font>

832
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,899
destination so the constraint for the

833
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,839
two out the LSP is that it should go

834
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:52,359
through a specific link l1 and for that

835
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,390
normally to take three labels for the

836
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">label stack now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> node p1 has a</font>

837
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,950
restriction that it can read only for

838
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,270
labels on the label stack so when you

839
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:03,609
have a three label label stack and you

840
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">insert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a liil essentially the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AL is too</font>

841
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:09,759
deep for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 p-12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read the label stock</font>

842
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,750
and do good load balancing so

843
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,150
essentially there are a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

844
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,250
recommendations and in following the

845
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommendations you have to insert</font>

846
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,809
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> lol's or in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific case</font>

847
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,390
it is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> li else need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inserted</font>

848
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:25,089
into the label stack and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown in</font>

849
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:28,450
the bottom you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this better on</font>

850
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:31,779
the in the draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think next slide</font>

851
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so there are a few related</font>

852
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,700
discussions that have happened one is

853
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,410
regarding support<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the hardware</font>

854
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:42,279
capability parameter specifically the

855
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:43,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">RLD for and whether it should be</font>

856
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,000
interface specific now we have

857
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered several cases it introduces a</font>

858
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,200
significant amount of complexity into

859
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,930
the solution and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> benefits seem to be</font>

860
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,549
fairly minimal and we haven't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

861
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,950
don't have a strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case we think</font>

862
00:48:54,549 --> 00:49:01,000
it's worth the<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort to actually go and</font>

863
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:02,319
do interface specific and the second

864
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,510
discussion that we've had is regarding

865
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,910
Oh am now the OEM requirements are still

866
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:09,430
being formed in segment routing and we

867
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,410
are working with those authors but the

868
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have recommended of</font>

869
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,540
using multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> l.i.e else is not</font>

870
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:20,530
expected to introduce new problems as

871
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:22,270
yet that's that's a thought right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we</font>

872
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,660
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it will introduce new</font>

873
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:29,440
OEM that new problems in existing OEM or

874
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:33,359
new OEM requirements itself so that's

875
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it any questions comments</font>

876
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:40,868
with regards to / interface we got

877
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,000
exactly same comments on ABC so when you

878
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:46,150
define how you exit your ingress router

879
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,369
you might have different labels to<font color="#E5E5E5"> excel</font>

880
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:51,250
if there's the valley the use case

881
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:52,869
please let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> now because we are at the</font>

882
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:56,650
point we decide whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it burn</font>

883
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:59,680
out or<font color="#CCCCCC"> per interface Ashline card no</font>

884
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,869
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that simple to make it burn</font>

885
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,808
interface because you have to model

886
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:07,480
where exactly the entry level is added

887
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:09,670
and might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> card it might be</font>

888
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,200
somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so I didn't hear any</font>

889
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,819
possible i heard not that simple so

890
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,009
giving a compelling use case if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,930
continued operation need to be done in

926
00:52:52,470 --> 00:53:02,950
okay and on the egress router so the

927
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:06,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">next operation can be done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this</font>

928
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:10,960
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about the controller control</font>

929
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:15,580
plan in can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISM for a mark for mr t FR</font>

930
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,190
with leave a GP extension for this am i

931
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:22,270
marchi a multi tablet segment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to need to</font>

932
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:26,190
be done and this segment need to be

933
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:30,009
unique within a GP domain and when this

934
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:32,050
segment was allocating we recommend this

935

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment was allocated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

938
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,990
do we recommend that that is better oh

939
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:47,370
ok so how to exactly how to assign this

940
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:51,640
segment we can do it manually or just

941
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:58,210
choosing the alligator automatically the

942
00:53:51,640 --> 00:54:00,879
detail we can do deciding future<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step we hope this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

type of the questions so kiri decompiler

948
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,629
have a naive question if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do multi</font>

950
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:28,930
multiple segments IDs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's we are</font>

then just use the existing label block

and index machinery for doing that what

976
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:05,620
you try to do here as far as I

977
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:08,979
understand is is you force every pack

989
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:52,690
just having a quick side discussion what

990
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,450
it looks like is you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">MRT not really multi topology and you</font>

992
00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:00,640
can do MRT calculations at the head end

993
00:56:57,309 --> 00:57:02,380
using existing SIDS and say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font>

994
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,629
blue parts and here's my blue label

00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,779
stock and here's my red<font color="#CCCCCC"> bath and here's</font>

my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reb the red label stock and if you do</font>

997
00:57:07,779 --> 00:57:12,220
the computations right whether you do

998
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:15,309
with them or some centralized magic SDN

999
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:18,549
controller does it you will get disjoint

1000
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:20,680
paths which is maybe what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1001
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me wrong I didn't say so</font>

1002
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,740
the idea actually oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris Bowers</font>

1003
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:30,578
juniper the idea cariddi is not to use a

1004
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:33,069
label stack to define the MRT path but

1005
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:37,750
to simply have it be another algorithm

1006
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:39,759
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently a CID is defined to follow</font>

1007
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,670
the shortest path that is computing the

1008
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:47,200
shortest path algorithm correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> and note</font>

1009
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:48,940
said and so correct correct so one and

1010
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,609
two for example could be red and blue

1011
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:55,720
and you simply populate the forwarding

1012
00:57:51,609 --> 00:58:02,009
entries for those for those algorithm

1013
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:02,009
SIDS thanks

1014
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and that's exactly on time and</font>

1015
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:11,630
that's a wrap people thank you very much

1016
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:14,920
we'll see you next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I think we'll</font>

1017
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,920
have a lot to discuss on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

1018
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:13,130
maybe a good

1019
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,630
you
