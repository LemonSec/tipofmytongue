1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,410
I like all the rules for being a speaker

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,730
it says please inform the speaker to

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,410
stay within the pink box although I've

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,390
been told I have a pass on this one no

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,950
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it I can't stand the</font>

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,420
box because the laptops over here and

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,669
the boxes over there you can see the

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,160
problem and so they moved the camera so

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,720
if i go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pink box i'm actually</font>

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,180
upsetting the camera people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't</font>

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,489
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and i tend to do this while</font>

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,989
speaking so that's probably breaking

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,090
some rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand there's a tumblr</font>

14
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,959
about the rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ietf it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also says</font>

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,550
that I'm not allowed to remove this

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,030

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to but now I want to so if you all</font>

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,329

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">little rule queers going to call them</font>

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,760
rule cards there's a rule card that's

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's standard now so</font>

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760
there's a rule card on this microphone

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,379
over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says you have to say your</font>

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,199
name before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ask a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so unless</font>

question you can just say your name as

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,430
I've heard the questions and I don't

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,720
want to be challenged that much again

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,830
one last to raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,970

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,189
because I lived in Virginia for a while

36
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I think we can get started yeah is</font>

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think we all just basically do</font>

47
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,549
things when Vin tells us to and the last

48
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,589
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at I ATF was I a GF 73 in</font>

49
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,320
Minneapolis Minnesota I don't know how

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">many of you were there in Minnesota you</font>

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,019
might remember mine as being the

52
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,990
shortest host planner in the history of

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IETF it was one min 47 seconds long</font>

54
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,380
and some of you came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to me and said</font>

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,250
listen the problem with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

56
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,989
because we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough time to</font>

57
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,550
spend at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back channel to slag on you</font>

58
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,350
so

59
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,930
in an effort to rectify that situation

60
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,049
this is we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 minutes to abuse you</font>

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,430
to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and although we'll have</font>

62
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,100
some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end for questions if</font>

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,370
you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do any of that so first I</font>

be intentional right so I'm gonna look

80
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,269
into that but i thought i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead</font>

81
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,340
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture event because we all just</font>

82
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,230
like him so<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much and i did ask him</font>

83
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,720
how much he weighed so in case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

84
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,570
wondering that's that's how tall he is

85
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,750
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 feet and one half of an inch not</font>

86
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,959
six and a half feet so standards again

87
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,880
would have been helpful here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,130
what I said was and what is still very

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,570
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> true is why should we will care</font>

90
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,450
about the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Engineering Task</font>

91
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Force right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google really only exists</font>

92
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,940
because the internet exists I know

93
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,709
shocker and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet really</font>

94
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,840
only exists because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ATF and groups</font>

95
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,810
not as important to like it you know

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,230
making things happen in a way that

97
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,970
doesn't exclude people doing things on

98
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,200
the internet and I know this is all

99
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,940
basic stuff but it's a lunch talk

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,890
psyching I don't have to be all cool

101
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,820
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last working group on telephone</font>

102
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,339
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there it wasn't just like</font>

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,810
how to call people or like a telephone

104
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,450
book for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF it was like something</font>

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,560
else i came in late so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was i</font>

106
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,519
think was about something else it wasn't

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,650
about a phone book there's a lot of

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,150
humming so anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the ITF is really</font>

109
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,099
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> google you know for obvious</font>

110
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,179
reasons you know we wouldn't exist

111
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,860
without the internet we wouldnt be able

112
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to crawl the internet if people didn't</font>

113
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,130
conform to certain standards and we

114
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,639
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to even fling packets</font>

115
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,599
around the way we're used to so

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,620
that's been hi Ben ah good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you</font>

117
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,438

118
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,669
seat here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there and there there's</font>

119
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,499
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like seats up here folks if you</font>

120
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to said see this guy he's been</font>

121
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:49,039
raising his hand every time I've asked

122
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,129
like he wants someone to sit next to him

123
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,409
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I don't like in this guy he</font>

124
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,659
doesn't smell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think you took</font>

125
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:59,300
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shower right in the last 24 hours</font>

126
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:01,580
right or not and but he doesn't smell I

127
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">assure you I mean I would smell I have a</font>

128
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:09,430
very developed sense of smell Jim and

129
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,870
but yeah so but let's continue so

130
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,310
obviously I look after<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source for</font>

131
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google and what that means at Google</font>

132
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me be really clear about this</font>

133
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,009
is that i don't control anything no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

134
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:20,689
it means that whenever code comes into

135
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:24,879
the company and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our code leaves</font>

136
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:27,319
the company myself my group largely

137
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,449
largely we're a very large companies so

138
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,240
mistakes happen but largely we make sure

139
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,919
we we don't screw that up right that

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,259

143
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,539
screw that up because open source is

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,698
super important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google we use a ton</font>

145
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,860
of it we release a ton of it and and we

146
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,089
see the open source community not as

147
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,400
something separate from google but as

148
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:52,039
you know inherent in what we do we have

149
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">we employ a ton of people whose entire</font>

150
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,710
existence is either you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know working on</font>

151
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,969
releasing or being part of some open

source software development community

153
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:03,319
somewhere right so so we just want to

154
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:06,500
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and do it</font>

155
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,139
and do it correctly so that's kind of my

156
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,569
job now in a company the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

157
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,250
mistakes we made and other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

158
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,300
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so</font>

159
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,099
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we're</font>

160
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,629
there for them so they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

161
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,279
can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing others a seat</font>

162
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,539
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the others to up here in</font>

163
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:27,110
the front row doma i also look after

164
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:29,089
funny things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up like api</font>

165
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,830
specifications less licensing and the

166
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,120
rest and and making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

167
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,120
released under fair terms whenever

168
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,319
possible over there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,349
know you're not looking to talk to me if

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,839
you did you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk to the role card</font>

171
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:43,819
microphones so that's good we'll take

172
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,550
question interrupt any time you want but

173
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,100
whatever not that that would ever happen

174
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,450
I

175
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,590
to you so so when I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

176
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,659
talk I wanted to give here I didn't want

177
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just like rehash like oh here's all</font>

178
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,380
the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> we released and stuff I didn't</font>

179
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,450
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that I wanted to talk about</font>

180
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,340
somethings really been bugging me over

181
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,750
the last and its really been happening

182
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,219
more of the last two or three years and

183
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,600
over the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years and and there's a</font>

184
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,790
huge interaction with the standards

185
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,560
community in this to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

186
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,080
been extremely successful I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

187
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,510
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to tell tell tell you folks this</font>

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,510
and so is the internet right you've

189
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:25,260
heard of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet right so back in</font>

190
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,490
1994-95 i was i was in a i was in an

191
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,349
elevator<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> netscape had just gone</font>

192
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,210
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was in an elevator washington</font>

193
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,310
DC<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was working for a law firm at the</font>

194
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,200
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they had a burgeoning and very</font>

successful intellectual property

196
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,070
practice and and and the lawyer he looks

197
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,780
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> me he's like you're with the IT</font>

198
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,460
department aren't you I mean we were

199
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,859
such the IT department at this law firm

200
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,539
me be very clear what they did for for

201
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,890
the IT department the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reaper graphics</font>

202
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,870
department people who photocopy things

203
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:53,330
and the accounting department they took

204
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,330
the bottom parking

205
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,740
you

206
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,549
when off

207
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,800
base

208
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,750
so you would go to work I would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,810
the bottom of the parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot I would</font>

210
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,040
park my car and I go down a level<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

211
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is in Washington</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DC so I'm</font>

212
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,280
literally like seven storeys below the

213
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,659
water table and probably some cold war

214
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,880
bunker they converted with pretty

215
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,680
lighting and carbon monoxide detectors

216
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,180
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the worst place for a</font>

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,690
data center eight stories underground

218
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:24,080
but whatever so so I was writing up the

219
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,370
elevator to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some sunlight and and he</font>

220
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,400
says to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me you're one of those IT guys</font>

221
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,520
right I'm like yeah he's like and I was

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">a kid so I was probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh um and he's</font>

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,370
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you saw that netscape on</font>

224
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,309
public i make sure of course you know

225
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,909
and he goes that's on the internet right

226
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">not my yes and he goes well you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

227
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,650
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something I'm really</font>

228
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">disappointed in tcp/ip oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well why are</font>

229
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,360
you disappointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in tcp/ip I think it's</font>

230
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,740
a brilliant protocol he goes well you

231
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,780
know if they had properly patented that

232
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,780
they could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> charged for every packet</font>

233
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,630
and I'm like it's one of the moments

234
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,490
you're like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

235
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,280
respectful of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers no matter</font>

236
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,990
how stupid they are and and and I said

237
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,760
well you have to realize there are

238
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,500
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocols out there that we're</font>

239
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,990
happy to charge you a penny per packet

240
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,890
or or a tenth of a cent per packet right

241
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,140
we had our essays we had I said the OSI

242
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,069
stack because I like making fun of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

243
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,330
but like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of</font>

244
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,880
things that people were happy to charge

245
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,370
you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> charger charger will charge you</font>

246
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,420
for and and when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to sell</font>

247
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,190
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people some people</font>

248
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,689
doubted them sure and they would show up

249
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,080
and playing some token ring somewhere

250
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,910
and but tcp/ip took off for the same

251
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,440
reason the internet took off right you

252
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,959
know no one was basically rent-seeking

253
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,150
and it was a clever protocol right that

254
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,160
would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we wanted it to do which</font>

255
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,949
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet connect computers right</font>

256
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,839
so and that's obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

257
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,400
simplification of why tcp/ip is awesome

258
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,200
but it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one of those</font>

259
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,500
moments<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I shouldn't work here</font>

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,150
at this law firm<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what am I</font>

261
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,530
doing here and of course we also

262
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:05,620
represented Satan but I'm sorry it was

263
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,209
tobacco and oil but not that oh it's

264
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,400
funny i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a beef against oil</font>

265
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,200
but the tobacco and the anti Superfund

266
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,790
law suits but we won't go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">short it is that that law firms not in</font>

268
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,349
business anymore so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can trash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him as</font>

269
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,120
much as I want they grew too fast bro

270
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,830
too much money and try to charge per

271
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,870
packet I'm sure so so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

272
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:29,200
though it really drove home even back in

273
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,760
the mid-90s it's like you know having

274
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
these open solutions you open standards

275
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,610
and I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really refined in the word</font>

276
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source we hadn't coined it yet or</font>

277
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:40,780
anything you know I knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the GPL a</font>

278
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,400
new and all that stuff but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

279
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,610
the word free was so powerful back in

280
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,910
henan and just you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> download you</font>

281
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,650
could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you could serve up pages</font>

282
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,030
so easily you didn't have to ask

283
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,319
anyone's permission you'd have to go to

284
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,500
a vendor and in fact if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to a</font>

285
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,300
vendor you would be just slow right you

286
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,490
could cut at the time you would contact

287
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the Sun Microsystems of the day and</font>

288
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,930
and you would say hey I want to make a

289
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,610
webpage happen and be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font>

290
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,279
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send over it account executive</font>

291
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,649
your granddaddy

292
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">my client licenses and better then I'm</font>

293
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,970
like actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i already downloaded</font>

294
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:16,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">apache and i'm already serving stuff and</font>

295
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,459
it's like it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fast right so</font>

296
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i always felt that like you know the</font>

297
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,998
open standards of the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

298
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,979
source implementations of it they were

299
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,449
hand in hand and they grew so fast

300
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">because no one else could keep up with</font>

301
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:31,128
them in the commercial world right and

302
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:33,709
that's that's again a simplification but

303
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:36,499
it was it was really pretty neat and and

304
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,689
and we were in a time in the mid-90s

305
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,639
right where everything had stopped

306
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:42,349
working so well write it was really

307
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,750
boring right if you had an awesome

308
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,670
desktop application you

309
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,940
or

310
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,469
be like

311
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">good then Microsoft will kill you</font>

312
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you or so you'd have a really hard time</font>

313
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:03,100
shipping suddenly or something because

314
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:06,100
it was it was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you it's so</font>

315
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,059
associated with excuse my

316
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,939
language internet

317
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:15,269
you know it was true you had a really

318
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,269
hard time

319
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,070
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny too because with web</font>

320
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,280
browsers you know I'm sure you all

321
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:28,880
remember like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the long slog of ie6 right</font>

322
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,770
until until he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Ross and Ben</font>

323
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,720
gujar they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla they stripped</font>

324
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,360
out all the crap I mean it wasn't crap

325
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,690
it was just thick right they got rid of

326
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,300
the web designer the mail client the

327
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">gopher client the ftp client out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

328
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,569
gopher was still in there the ftp client

329
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,949
all that stuff has got rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font>

330
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,040
they added an extension system they said

331
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,480
here's just like pure gecko with basic

332
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,640
bookmarking and the school extension

333
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,470
system and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox and people</font>

334
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,040
are like whoa what browsers can be fast

335
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,930
and cool and and not give my computer to

336
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,810
whatever random weapon<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeanette visit</font>

337
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is great right and and and at</font>

338
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,369
the time you know people would go to it

339
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,319
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verified they would go</font>

340
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the Steve Ballmer's and and the</font>

341
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,740
higher-ups at Microsoft's say you know

342
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,980
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than 10 people and ie and</font>

343
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,090
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like why well this Firefox thing is</font>

344
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,190
doing really well he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what's their</font>

345
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,200
market share and it was like one percent

346
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">two percent they're like he's like come</font>

347
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">back in my office when they hit nine</font>

348
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,400
percent they're like nine percent and he

349
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,010
basically pulled it up his back pocket

350
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,090
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is near is it yeah and he's like</font>

351
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,000
yeah once they hit nine percent I'll

352
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,920
care again because until then what's the

353
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,270
point of wasting the money it's like

354
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,740
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so they waited and and you</font>

355
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,030
know Firefox hit nine percent you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

356
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,280
in a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years it took a little</font>

357
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,709
while and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they hired a thousand</font>

358
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,579
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to were coming IE team and it's</font>

359
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:56,720
like whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see single vendors take</font>

360
00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:00,320
control of a given technology it just

361
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,240
stops<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stinks you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know because it</font>

362
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,660
makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard for independent</font>

363
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,640
smaller vendors even other projects to

364
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,020
take hold and what I've seen in my

365
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,189
career and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source is that open</font>

366
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,020
source projects will often say oh wait a

367
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,030
second you know why aren't we doing this

368
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's do this right and so they they</font>

369
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,189
come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next server software</font>

370
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,050
the next bit of operating system that is

371
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:26,060
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compete against these</font>

372
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:28,699
entrenched interests and and without the

373
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,170
OSS pressure if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will other vendors</font>

374
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,500
have to rise up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

375
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:38,439
it's pretty rare right vendors kind of

376
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:41,510
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> their monopolies right so without</font>

377
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,889
open source fighting you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bad</font>

378
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,980
place and what's funny too is you know

379
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,930
it's not that open source is itself

380
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,490
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or worse than a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given vendors</font>

381
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,239
implementation we can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

382
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:56,930
for hours we won't mind you and in fact

383
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,620
you've seen OSS projects get calcified

384
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,300
right and and stop innovating and or

385
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,980
even become insecure and then another

386
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,569
one will pop up and they'll start

387
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,160
fighting and it'll be better<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

388
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,170
us all of us system administrators and

389
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,600
users and and the rest you'll even see

390
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,079
you know vendors say we'll wait a second

391
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,360
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> sendmail is is great but it's</font>

392
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,359
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to configure a sin ml</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cfos</font>

393
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,910
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cue male was just turning up</font>

394
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,529
and meanwhile outlook and or whatever

395
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,930
they call their server exchange it's

396
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,260
time they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we can really go</font>

397
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,819
after this market because people want a

398
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,100
decent mail server and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

399
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,600
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> time maintaining a secure send mail</font>

400
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,220
server without<font color="#E5E5E5"> rbl all the rest right so</font>

401
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,440
so so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happening and it's</font>

402
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually really good for computer</font>

403
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,540
science is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for the computer</font>

404
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,550
industry and its really good for

405
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,420
standards when people are fighting to

406
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:52,240
serve people better and and when you

407
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,490
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the standards that come under</font>

408
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,870
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know say one vendor control or you</font>

409
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,480
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that come under one</font>

410
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,250
vendors like iron grip it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a</font>

411
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,870
grim thing and and there was a

412
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,110
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if it was at</font>

413
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,399
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF but it was recent I couldn't</font>

414
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember or hers from it actually i</font>

415
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,940
think it was around the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> i triple e</font>

416
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,069
IPR policy well they're talking about

417
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,140
free and reasonable mountain you know

418
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:18,769
terms all this stuff and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

419
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,930
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> qualcomm was was for it</font>

420
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,420
so everyone was assuming it was bad for

421
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,849
everybody else and it's like well had

422
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,889
that happened right and so in

423
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:32,690
organizations that aren't the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF where</font>

424
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:34,850
they have very controlling views of what

425
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,589
happens with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP that create that is</font>

426
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,800
created in these standards organizations

427
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:41,990
you have real problems with innovation

428
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,769
you have real problems moving computer

429
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,040
science forward

430
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:48,529
so so so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to say that an ideal</font>

431
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,860
situation honestly in my mind is when

432
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:53,899
you have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source efforts</font>

433
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,720
along with multiple vendor efforts

434
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,069
fighting basically tell people out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

435
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,019
actually see this in a hybrid situation

436
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:01,729
if you look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether it's</font>

437
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,809
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like docker engine X where</font>

438
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,939
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this really you know</font>

439
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,799
innovative prolific fast-moving open

440
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,809
source project and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

441
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,579
company saying well how do we sell

442
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,658
services or whatever around that and so

443
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,779
they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of serve both</font>

444
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,309
models at the same time but it's it's I

445
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:20,539
think it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for the internet</font>

446
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:24,849
when that happens I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really</font>

447
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:27,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for humans when that happens so</font>

448
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,449
because standards do exist without open

449
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,220
source I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their best when they</font>

450
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,870
have open source implementations and in

451
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,610
fact I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think that a good standard</font>

452
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,559
can exist without a good open source

453
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,570
implementation but they certainly do all

454
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,889
the time if you look in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of of</font>

455
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,770
electrical interfacing if you look in

456
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world of telecom construction law</font>

457
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:48,470
there's all these standards that are out

458
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,230
there and they're often incredibly

459
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,940
locked down you know especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

460
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,070
in the electrical engineering space it's

461
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,309
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to say I mean this is what</font>

462
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,020
kepta I think was the 1394 connections

463
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:01,158
back for<font color="#E5E5E5"> years because if you wanted to</font>

464
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,600
ship something that supported that

465
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,270
standard you would have be paying Apple

466
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,370
a fee every single time and it's like

467
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,690
and then you had the USB standard rise

468
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,949
up but all you really had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do for that</font>

469
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,480
one to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that standard</font>

470
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,190
organization was you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay a</font>

471
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,770
one-time fee and it was accessible even

472
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,730
to the smallest vendors or frankly you

473
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,379
would be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese vendor and you</font>

474
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,620
wouldn't care and you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway right</font>

475
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,419
um no I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's it's it's a</font>

476
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,510
different approach but when they allowed

477
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,860
for and I mean that not in a way that's

478
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,450
like coming down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the Chinese</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

479
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,070
love I don't know if you've ever been

480
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,510
have any of you have ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

481
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:38,418
shenzhen and the factories there I it's

482
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,908
incredibly invigorating I mean it the

483
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,980
air is terrible but the the the

484
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,650
factories and the stores and those

485
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,210
enormous like 20

486
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,520
44

487
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,850
for

488
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,860
smalls which are like 10 by 10 stores

489
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,320
selling tablets all running Android

490
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,850
nowadays mind you but tablets and phones

491
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,560
and drones and toys and it's just it's

492
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,330
amazing as a computer scientist in

493
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,940
somebody who picks up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a soldering iron</font>

494
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,949
once a year or so it's an amazing place

495
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:15,360
of it and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the kind</font>

496
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,980
of innovation that happens there is just

497
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,270
astonishing but I don't want to digress

498
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so if you really look at how</font>

499
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,900
standards organizations work and how

500
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,250
standards come about oh do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

501
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,300
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you're at the yet to say</font>

502
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,700
your name first<font color="#E5E5E5"> according to the roll</font>

503
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,470
out of all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a clarifying</font>

504
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,260
question yes when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you speak about</font>

505
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:37,500
standards organizations for some reason

506
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,070
when I read this I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

507
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,930
question can be asked in multiple ways i

508
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,490
can open standards exist without open

509
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:48,960
source can formal standards exist

510
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:51,210
without open forest source are you going

511
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,250
to delve into that level of detail

512
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,510
that's a little bit i mean so I talk

513
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,740
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain standards like so for</font>

514
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,660
instance if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it spike</font>

515
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,060
on the next slide yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

516
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about now I can I can skip a bullet</font>

517
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,429
point I'm allowed I'm the speaker you

518
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:09,450
can eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ham wrap sandwich I know</font>

519
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:11,640
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no hammer yeah so if you look at</font>

520
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,930
an area where this drives me crazy all

521
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,240
off I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where you want ended up</font>

522
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,190
sitting down the thing that drives me

523
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,600
crazy about for instance media standards

524
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,000
and codecs<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right these are</font>

525
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,129
incredibly locked down right and yet

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,170
they're often standardized right and

527
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,180
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> call that MPEG la a</font>

528
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,990
standards organization or cartel or

529
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:34,200
whatever they have standardized you know

530
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,540
mpeg-2 epic for you know these standards

531
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,370
through those organizations that don't

532
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,320
look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> iit if they don't look like</font>

533
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,709
any of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and they also charge</font>

534
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,100
a huge amount of money for access and

535
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,480
the ability to use these standards and

536
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,010
so they set up the cartel model around

537
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what drives you and what should</font>

538
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,490
drive you crazy even more so so for

539
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,490
instance when ac3 went into the iso

540
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,770
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> iso was like well you know we</font>

541
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,720
can't just call this a standard and let

542
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,929
you go and and charge fortune for these

543
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so I so came up with this frankly</font>

544
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,399
pretty ridiculous license around ac3 and

545
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,730
what it said was here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference</font>

546
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:12,389
code to implement a c3 which is a sound

547
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:16,529
standard by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font>

548
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:20,248
know and if you download this code from

549
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:23,369
the ISO website or repository or get it

550
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:26,249
on some CD or whatever and you put it

551
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:28,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">into your software and you offer the</font>

552
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:33,029
source code for it too and you call it a

553
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,369
c3 then you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a standard</font>

554
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:36,539
implementation and so at the time I was

555
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:38,309
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> at VA Linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were running</font>

556
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">sourceforge and a bunch of people had</font>

557
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,759
done exactly that they downloaded it

558
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,279
they offered it as I think was at the

559
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,830
time ffmpeg or one of those projects and

560
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,899
they had offered a c3 decoding so the

561
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,869
lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general counsel from Dolby</font>

562
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:53,639
called up my general counsel at<font color="#E5E5E5"> VA Linux</font>

563
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:57,418
because we were hosting the code on

564
00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:00,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">sourceforge and left this you swear word</font>

565
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,369
Laden message on her answering machine

566
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,840
she brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in her office she's like</font>

567
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:07,320
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all who's the crazy man</font>

568
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,320
swearing at me and he was famous for

569
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,629
swearing at people by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and then</font>

570
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,980
are we actually in trouble here you know

571
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:17,039
do we actually have to care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he says</font>

572
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:20,369
and I was like well let's let's take a

573
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,990
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular example and</font>

574
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:24,149
they were calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a c3 they were</font>

575
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">offering software source code and they</font>

576
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,479
and they were basically implementing the

577
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:29,399
ISO standards so you know I called him

578
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,830
back and I left a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message with very</font>

579
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:33,600
little swear words on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess machine</font>

580
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,999
saying listen if you didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

581
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,980
release this information you shouldn't

582
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:39,720
have release it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sep right and</font>

583
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,360
future versions actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

584
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,799
they did so yeah you see this all the

585
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,658
time where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will create standards</font>

586
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">charge for them they will standardize</font>

587
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,450
them but also run seek alongside them

588
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:55,470
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's obviously</font>

589
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,970
successful right and I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

590
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that that didn't exist and didn't</font>

591
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and then there are not open</font>

592
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:01,949
source implementations because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

593
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,240
tell you the iso standard reference

594
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,580
license is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not compatible with</font>

595
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source licenses but most people</font>

596
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,249
don't care because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

597
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,560
complying with that license within the

598
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:15,290
milieu of licenses that they support so

599
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,790
and I like to track it back to so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18t</font>

600
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,320
had that monopoly for years you couldn't

601
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,170
plug anything into the phone line Alice

602
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,510
it was that bakelite you know phone from

603
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,280
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 and they were forced to allow</font>

604
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,260
other people to build phones and to

605
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,300
build phone services that could talk to

606
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,370
their network and I think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

607
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">late 70s I some of you probably remember</font>

608
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,669
this way better than I do not i'm not

609
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,520
saying you're old just for the record

610
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,050
but but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think was in the late</font>

611
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventies that happen and then you saw</font>

612
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:45,620
this like flourishing of innovation

613
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,760
right you saw really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool phones but</font>

614
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,110
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> importantly you remember modems</font>

615
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,290
right do you remember the modems that

616
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,629
you had to sock<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stupid you know</font>

617
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,370
receiver pair into because you couldn't

618
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,320
plug it in right they couldn't sell it

619
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,090
advice that you could plug in and then

620
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,280
you could write and suddenly you know

621
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,100
Hayes popped up and started shipping<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300</font>

622
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,500
bits per second and it was great right

623
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,780
and and and frankly you know we may not

624
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,690
be here if it wasn't for that early

625
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,370
decision right so so yeah so i think

626
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,880
that's that's a bad thing and so the

627
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:20,780
question that becomes um do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

628
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,600
conflict to flourish in open standards

629
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,639
right does there have to be multiple

630
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,040
open source multiple vendors fighting

631
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,350
for us to ship standards that people

632
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,899
going to actually flip and use right and

633
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,189
i would i would say yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and someone</font>

634
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,900
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might have been Jim you</font>

635
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,000
mentioned this in the email he sent me

636
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,840
and and I glommed onto this one sentence

637
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,910
where it was like do we need he's like

638
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,679
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an open standard if it's</font>

639
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,290
just one open source implementation that

640
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,850
everyone is using and and what I've seen

641
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,590
when this happens is people say well

642
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the standard and if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

643
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,300
what WG the wat working group which does

644
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's adopted by the</font>

645
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,270
Deputy Arce it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to</font>

646
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,340
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> ian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hickson I know this is a very</font>

647
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,080
thing do you should get it yes go to

648
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:11,480
Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes say your name here say your</font>

649
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:13,429
name Jim got us<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google in the last 48</font>

650
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,879
hours a second implementation has

651
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:20,169
appeared courtesy of Marcus

652
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:23,859
for that protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the babble babble</font>

653
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:28,959
routing protocol so there's two yay so

654
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:31,299
we have a war but but so so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

655
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:33,219
at how some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these great standards</font>

656
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:36,249
show up it are they really just

657
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:37,329
transcription of some market winter and

658
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:39,399
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

659
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:42,129
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a little bit so let's</font>

660
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:44,139
let's hop over to where phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> were I</font>

661
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,299
think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned this in my last longer</font>

662
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:48,698
talk at IETF so I'm going to blow

663
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this pretty fast but there was a</font>

664
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:51,339
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Symbian phones were ninety</font>

665
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:53,469
percent of what we would call the

666
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:54,908
smartphone world and there was way fewer

667
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:58,449
smartphones back than there are now of

668
00:25:54,909 --> 00:26:01,029
course and the browsers and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

669
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:02,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">use that word really loosely that we're</font>

670
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,419
on phones back then you would literally

671
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,399
have to buy placement if you wanted your

672
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:09,999
website to be on a phone and that's

673
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,619
terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and and the iphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

674
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:13,179
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android was too they're both</font>

675
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:15,369
being sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of developed at about the</font>

676
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:19,319
same time and people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe me</font>

677
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:21,728
want to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's true and and</font>

678
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,949
it was in response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically nobody</font>

679
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:26,669
wanted a single vendor to control

680
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:30,069
anything unless it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves right</font>

681
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:33,369
and so they saw what was going on and

682
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:36,668
and nokia you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really they</font>

683
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:38,408
owned the market and and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were like</font>

684
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:39,549
well what what happens if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

685
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:42,219
in that market what happens if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

686
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:47,199
to ship a web page to a phone you know

687
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:48,279
yeah trail<font color="#E5E5E5"> users can reach it great and</font>

688
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:49,779
that's neat and they had this really

689
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,149
cool sort of ecosystem but it was very

690
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:57,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">small because they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble with</font>

691
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:59,319
distribution so anyways the world that

692
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:02,369
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening so if you again if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

693
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:05,349
went to these shenzhen malls back in

694
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,668
2005-2006 the iphone had just come out

695
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:09,428
and you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to them you say hey do you</font>

696
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:11,589
guys have iphones and I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

697
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:14,019
brought my iphone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bought back</font>

698
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:16,539
then it was pink it was a flip phone and

699
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:19,690
it had an apple on a heck of it like a

700
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,519
sticker and and what it was was they

701
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,899
were taking windows ce e they wouldn't

702
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">pay for windows mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because windows</font>

703
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:26,889
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost three dollars more per copy</font>

704
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:28,419
than windows ce e so they take windows

705
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:29,199
ce e which they would sometimes pay for

706
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,789
sometimes on

707
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,919
but it was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a buck or two bucks per</font>

708
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:34,779
phone right and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had</font>

709
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,519
their own dialers that they made and

710
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,960
they would just slap him on there and

711
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:42,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">then they had a skin then they put an</font>

712
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,990
apple on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of and and so you</font>

713
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,360
know they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously they</font>

714
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,130
couldn't adopt<font color="#E5E5E5"> apples software these</font>

715
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,580
different you know handset manufacturers

716
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,260
and and so when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone came out</font>

717
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,210
they came to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like okay so</font>

718
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,179
we liked your pitch for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android before</font>

719
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,700
but we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it now so what do you</font>

720
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,980
got right and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were thinking</font>

721
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android we knew we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to compete</font>

722
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,480
not just with the existential threat

723
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:10,600
that Apple posed to all these companies

724
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,940
but we also had to compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with cheaper</font>

725
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,678
you know windows implementations on top

726
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,850
of windows ce e and the rest because

727
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,049
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to ship something that</font>

728
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:21,549
would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone call so we wanted to</font>

729
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,679
make android open source from the start

730
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:24,879
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at what we open</font>

731
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,620
source back then and what we continue to

732
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source it's basically like you have</font>

733
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,309
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux kernel and then you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

734
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,679
whole pile of<font color="#CCCCCC"> apache code which is</font>

735
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:36,158
permissibly license and also has a

736
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,870
patent grant attached and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

737
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google specific services on top of</font>

738
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and and the point was from the very</font>

739
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning I was like listen here's your</font>

740
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,169
were getting you started here right we

741
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,840
can all center on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same sets of</font>

742
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,490
drivers the same sets of interfaces and

743
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,049
we can ship something that's open source

744
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,450
and the reason we did the open source

745
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:57,250
was it's the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to share software</font>

746
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,519
frankly and also the reason we did a

747
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,590
patchy it was multi-fold personally I I

748
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:03,639
really prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we</font>

749
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">were talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do this house</font>

750
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:09,250
likely she is Apache but also we need

751
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,239
something that carriers frankly would

752
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:15,820
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be able to comply with by</font>

753
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">default so we wrote a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tooling so</font>

754
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,158
that when you build Android it's

755
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:19,389
actually hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build something that</font>

756
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,880
isn't in compliance with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache</font>

757
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:24,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">License and then we tried to train them</font>

758
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,750
on the use of the GPL kernel and try to

759
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,070
make sure those kernels were available

760
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,919
for at least for the funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

761
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,590
personally shipped at Google and and

762
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,659
that was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard carriers handset</font>

763
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,000
manufacturers actually really bad at

764
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source compliance and and I it's</font>

765
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,559
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a malicious thing it's really just</font>

766
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,320
it's hard for them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they want to</font>

767
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,178
ship the phone every

768
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,830
stays they want to how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we where do we</font>

769
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:47,389
mirror this you know so these questions

770
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,399
come up and then the documentation

771
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,840
requirements are very hard so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font>

772
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,149
to create a phone that they could comply

773
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,259
with very easily and we were mostly

774
00:29:53,149 --> 00:30:01,399
successful so that was good yeah let me

775
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:03,110
continue here so browsers um I mentioned

776
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:08,360
the nine percent story that's all cool

777
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,979
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox crew for i want to say</font>

778
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,678
they hit twelve thirteen percent before

779
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,940
we started seeing IE actually start

780
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,830
being any good again and and we were you

781
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">know at Google we were giving a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

782
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">patches into Firefox at the time and</font>

783
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:24,320
what we wanted as we want a<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript</font>

784
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:27,500
performance to improve we wanted

785
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,689
sandboxing on a per tab basis we wanted

786
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">better security and we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a</font>

787
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,159
harder and harder time seeing our

788
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:35,719
patches accepted because they're like

789
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,879
whoa whoa<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sandboxing thing you</font>

790
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,799
want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's we're gonna have to</font>

791
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:43,360
change everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that to work and</font>

792
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:45,769
we're like yes but you need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

793
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,649
anyone's ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a tab take out their</font>

794
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:50,330
entire browser knows that you needed it

795
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:51,620
and it was hard for them to prioritize

796
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,500
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay so we did chrome and</font>

797
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,860
and we really scrum under bsd license

798
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,570
and what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we picked that both</font>

799
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:03,649
because we were basing it largely on the

800
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:05,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">cage tml and and and that work which</font>

801
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:07,489
actually came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the Conqueror</font>

802
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:10,879
browser was used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Safari it was worked</font>

803
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:13,009
on by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple and released his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BSD and</font>

804
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:16,009
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started really see under BST as</font>

805
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wells and our goal was that the any</font>

806
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:22,460
browser any browser could adopt our

807
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,389
changes and around sandbox and the

808
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,490
Restless we thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

809
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:28,370
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping the internet as</font>

810
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,440
sort of a safe place to serve and we

811
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,418
were kind of successful with that chrome

812
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,070
was very successful as a browser but i

813
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,840
would say we were only moderately

814
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,960
successful getting other people to adopt

815
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,340
what we were doing a lot of people saw

816
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,230
the light on JavaScript performance

817
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,850
which was great great for everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

818
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">is using a browser you saw better</font>

819
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript performance from from Apple</font>

820
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,960
Microsoft Mozilla and and so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

821
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:57,309
claim some bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that for</font>

822
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,809
for our chrome folks but we still don't

823
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sand boxes across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> browsers</font>

824
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,220
and that's that's probably the biggest

825
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,979
existential danger din the internet if

826
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,149
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are places that can break through</font>

827
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,159
to your machine through your browser

828
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:10,239
it's bad for internet sites it's bad for

829
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,970
internet surfing and it drives more

830
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,559
people into the apps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have become</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

831
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:21,429
very popular on phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff yeah so</font>

832
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:24,428
let me so we get to the meat of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

833
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:25,659
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'd love to tell</font>

834
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:28,000
you that I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the</font>

835
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:31,710
position of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open daylight versus other</font>

836
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">STM things we started funding sdn work</font>

837
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,480
well let me take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step back back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

838
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,159
2007-2008 broadcom fabrics which is

839
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,230
we're not supported by lenox period end

840
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,620
of story and we really needed it because

841
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:48,190
we were looking at frankly extremely

842
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:51,809
costly high densities which costs at

843
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:54,669
Google and so we wanted to deploy

844
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:57,460
switches that had many thousands of

845
00:32:54,669 --> 00:33:00,850
ports and were very fast but to do so

846
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,230
with commercial equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna</font>

847
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,649
say it would bankrupt us because we were

848
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:08,020
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but it was gonna be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extremely</font>

849
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:10,418
costly on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> orders of many many many</font>

850
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">many practically a thousand dollars</font>

851
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:15,399
report but many hundreds of dollars per

852
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:17,799
port and and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was untenable so</font>

853
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:19,360
we wanted to have our own switch fabric

854
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,270
so as early as 2006 we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

855
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,908
on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing and then broadcom</font>

856
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,230
fabric support you know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just</font>

857
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:28,590
get that would be great so we funded a

858
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,590
lot of work

859
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,440
well

860
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:38,520
this or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SDN future right and and</font>

861
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">so a lot of the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did there</font>

862
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that we did there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is now being</font>

863
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:51,899
standardized and what does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

864
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:54,330
right so is this a real thing so because

865
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm there there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people from</font>

866
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,110
cisco and juniper here i'm sure and i

867
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,350
don't want to alienate you from the

868
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:04,770
pulpit here but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people see</font>

869
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">opendaylight is basically those</font>

870
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:09,000
organizations being like Qualcomm on

871
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:12,840
that earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> example therefore it should</font>

872
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,610
we be worried you know are they trying

873
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to squash this really interesting new</font>

874
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:21,300
technology or are they trying to help it

875
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:22,889
is it run seeking is it the JCP or is it

876
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,040
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly open so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

877
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something that cisco and juniper</font>

878
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,060
probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address if they want</font>

879
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:33,030
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of sign on and and the</font>

880
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,290
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opens there's a cable here</font>

881
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:38,790
that keeps stepping on I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk</font>

882
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,980
this way what's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

883
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:44,550
wake you up yes because my boys will

884
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,050
make you sleep um sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that AV</font>

885
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,470
person I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to screw up a mic</font>

886
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,760
here don't drop the mic by the way

887
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,199
people are like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I dropped the</font>

888
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,360
mic it's actually bad for the mic just

889
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:59,100
for the record anyway so opendaylight

890
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,110
right so because if you if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

891
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,900
companies like vastly or any fastly

892
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,550
people here at ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

893
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,580
that's true but I'm sure there are

894
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,930
people who use fastly here you know

895
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,120
fastly is basically it's a bunch of

896
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,620
linux boxes a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of white box linux</font>

897
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,680
boxes that they've programmed to do this

898
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:19,350
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work and and and they're very</font>

899
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,169
big fans of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just use these</font>

900
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,640
open implementations and it would be

901
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they weren't you know run</font>

902
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:31,770
seeked against for doing it yeah so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

903
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,069
think the IETF really has a role in

904
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,990
making sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdn persists as</font>

905
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,829
something that we can all take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

906
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,950
of and

907
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:45,069
help develop and move forward so keep it

908
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,089
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF okay so the other thing I want to</font>

909
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:47,440
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and think it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

910
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,519
bugging me over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last like three or</font>

911
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,259
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned earlier in the</font>

912
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:55,538
talk is that I I always see open source

913
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:58,450
is this beautiful palace on a hill right

914
00:35:55,539 --> 00:36:01,150
it's like it's such a special thing for

915
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,288
me the licenses the people who work on

916
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,940
the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's released under these</font>

917
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:07,900
licenses and unfortunately over the last

918
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,160
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last three or four years</font>

919
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,589
you started seeing people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

920
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,109
trick people like oh no we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

921
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:16,779
source and you're like are you are you

922
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:17,799
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I am NOT the kind of</font>

923
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,059
person who says that you can't make

924
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:22,269
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> with open source I'm not that</font>

925
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:24,880
person at all anyone who knows me and my

926
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:31,229
my my my thing for expensive shoes knows

927
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:33,969
I like Mike making money<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but I was</font>

928
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:35,890
and I'm employed to make sure that

929
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:37,539
through the adoption of open source and

930
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,170
through the release of open source we're

931
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:45,009
not tricking or trapping people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

932
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:47,049
is my trips tracks and trolls so first

933
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:48,459
of all in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tricks thing there's</font>

934
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:50,440
people who approach open source and say

935
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:53,140
yeah we're open source where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up</font>

936
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,670
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it's open source and you</font>

937
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,879
see this actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot in a non</font>

938
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,199
malicious way in a benign way people who

939
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,519
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best of intentions but just</font>

940
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,869
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the education so for instance</font>

941
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,008
if you go to github today how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of</font>

942
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,069
you have downloaded something from

943
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:07,719
github and install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on machine ever so</font>

944
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:09,729
seventy percent of the code on github

945
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:11,469
has an open-source licenses copyright

946
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:15,129
the author and you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

947
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:16,390
that so why is that but if you email

948
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,940
them and say hey we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use</font>

949
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,410
this piece of code and you and they say

950
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,930
well yeah it's open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source is on github</font>

951
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,459
you say all<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a second there's no open</font>

952
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,680
source license on this thing and they're

953
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:29,618
like oh well can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me a blurry</font>

954
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,118
cost and it's like sure you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

955
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,069

959
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:39,940
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really open source did you mean</font>

960
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,190
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and nine times out of ten they</font>

972
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:03,520

973
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,730
you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they don't know what</font>

974
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,380
they're doing sometimes though they know

975
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,790
exactly what they're doing they say no

976
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,990
no I put up on github because I just

977
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to develop their I don't want</font>

978
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:16,060
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> using this code this is my know</font>

979
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,430
and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I totally respect</font>

980
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,660
your desires these other people who've

981
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:24,730
worked your code whatever but we're cool

982
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">now seriously because the gib terms of</font>

983
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,450
service are hilarious they basically say

984
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,770
by putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> your code up here you're</font>

985
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,080
allowing people to fork<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code</font>

986
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:35,020
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are not conferring copyright</font>

987

990
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,790
with on a regular basis that seems like

991
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,859
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion back to the</font>

992
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,570
maintainer of github that when you make

993
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,250
a new project one of the question should

994
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,960
be what license do you want for this so

995
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,160
they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a license picker and they</font>

996
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,510
have this choose your license that org

997
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,118
thing that they put together and they're

998
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,950
actually they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to be too</font>

999
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,180
heavy-handed because they want everyone

1000
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,740
to develop on github not just open

1001
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,270
source developers so so they've done

1002
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,950
some things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually they used to be</font>

1003
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,970
eighty-five percent of the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1004
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,230
licensed and then they put in the

1005
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,149
license chooser and went to seventy

1006
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,730
percent so that was a move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1007
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:12,580
say your first name a monocle stammering

1008
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,530
I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1009
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,960
you create a new repository it actually

1010
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,640
explicitly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you about what sort of</font>

1011
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,500
flies and yes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good for</font>

1012
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,859
it but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is that for</font>

1013
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,660
typical person who actually is educated

1014
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,490
enough to choose a license not me at

1015
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,980
least and I have bonds of github

1016
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,040
repositories so you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go home</font>

1017
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to pick a license right</font>

1018
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,980
but ya know so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of stuff</font>

1019
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,419
happens all the time and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

1020
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,470
training at Google's we say listen you

1021
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to use this code that's great we're</font>

1022
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:43,270
here to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sometimes you won't be</font>

1023
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,830
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to though other times people choose</font>

1024
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,940
Creative Commons licenses first of all

1025
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,190
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the creative commons fact they</font>

1026
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,660
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for software but</font>

1027
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,260
whatever and then they pick the

1028
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:56,680
non-commercial no modification you know

1029
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:59,230
by you know attribution version of the

1030
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,700
license and it's like really that's not

1031
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,650
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually sharing software</font>

1032
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,359
them you know you're you're doing

1033
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,309
something but and people always think

1034
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,589
that noncommercial means something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1035
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:09,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">well well noncommercial we're not going</font>

1036
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:11,890
to make any money from this code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1037
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:13,479
it's like well we're a commercial

1038
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,589
organization and in fact if you look at

1039
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,509
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of universities and the way</font>

1040
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:17,859
they're funded and their labs and the

1041
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:20,439
way the electro party in the labs gets

1042
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:22,420
gets sold and their commercial function

1043
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:25,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">too so you have the situation where</font>

1044
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,640
people use licenses that are completely

1045
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:29,380
inappropriate if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually want to</font>

1046
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">open source something so sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1047
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,849
actually don't want to open sourcing and

1048
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:35,319
you should respect that but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

1049
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,549
can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the code but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you</font>

1050
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:41,170
can't use it often times there's a new

1051
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:42,430
license called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the WTF PL which I'll</font>

1052
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,049
highlight in the next slide and I'll

1053
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,959
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but people create new</font>

1054
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:48,489
licenses and I'll tell you why that can

1055
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:50,259
be a bad thing and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> other times</font>

1056
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:53,589
they'll do this thing where they'll mix

1057
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:56,049
licenses together so jQuery is under a

1058
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:59,920
very permissive license I think it's BS

1059
00:40:56,049 --> 00:41:03,099
d or MIT I don't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> which are some</font>

1060
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,630
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular jQuery plugins are</font>

1061
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:10,449
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely viral a GPL license</font>

1062
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:13,509
which actually reaches across network as

1063
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's so the GPL if I give it to Jim and</font>

1064
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:17,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jim wasn't working at Google or whatever</font>

1065
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,459
and i said here's some software gym and

1066
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:20,078
it's GPL you can say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like</font>

1067
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:21,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see the GPL coat and i would have to</font>

1068
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">give it to Jim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I would want to give</font>

1069
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,249
it to gym because I made that choice the

1070
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,589
a GPL is a little different if Jim

1071
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:29,948
visits a web page and it has some a GPL

1072
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:31,449
content now he's within his right can I

1073
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:33,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the code for all the stuff on the</font>

1074
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,089
web page oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is going over the</font>

1075
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:35,529
network and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have your own</font>

1076
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:37,959
network switches can I see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> code oh</font>

1077
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:40,359
and this is hitting these servers and

1078
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:42,419
can we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> code because it the</font>

1079
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:44,739
virality is through the the network port

1080
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,309
so obviously we don't use this at Google

1081
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:49,779
but sometimes people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will slip in</font>

1082
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:53,769
because they just by default use a GPL

1083
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:56,650
or GPL or whatever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be very</font>

1084
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:59,939
tricky for people but it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1085
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:02,319
trick it might be just benign neglect or

1086
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:03,368
that's what they wanted right so you

1087
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,189
have to assume people know what they're

1088
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:07,779
doing when they pick these licenses

1089
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,879
other times people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh we're using</font>

1090
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:11,799
ffmpeg but it's lgpl<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's totally</font>

1091
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to ship it this way and I'm like no</font>

1092
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:15,400
it's not it's GPL no like no no see

1093
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,999
here's the license its lgpl<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like</font>

1094
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,130
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use this compile flat look yeah</font>

1095
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:22,899
how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

1096
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:25,329
using ffmpeg everyone uses that compile

1097
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,410
talkin ffmpeg and they're like oh well

1098
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:29,829
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do and I'm like it makes</font>

1099
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:32,558
a GPL because it basically brings with

1100
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:35,499
it like MPEG four and two compatibility

1101
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,479
which everyone needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> form FM peg so</font>

1102
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:41,558
everyone compiles it that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

1103
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:43,390
and yeah so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes things become a</font>

1104
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">different license because of how they're</font>

1105
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,788
configured and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how to</font>

1106
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:47,439
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this they don't they don't</font>

1107
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:49,029
understand and then they end up breaking

1108
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,640
a license right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad</font>

1109
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:53,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's the wrong thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and</font>

1110
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,509
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who either</font>

1111
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:59,469
embrace or completely reject the or

1112
00:42:55,509 --> 00:43:02,769
later versions language in in the GPL

1113
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:04,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lgpl because they either want to</font>

1114
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:06,819
reinforce patent sharing and replace

1115
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,468
ability or they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reject it right</font>

1116
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:11,049
and so there's all these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1117
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:13,469
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of kind of look into and</font>

1118
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:15,640
understand if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ship a product</font>

1119
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:17,469
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this real question that</font>

1120
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,179
comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of god this is like I</font>

1121
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,670
could be employed<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the rest of my</font>

1122
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:25,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">life on this sentence alone all of you</font>

1123
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,920
can this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great scam for jobs when</font>

1124
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:28,299
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in not a plugin when is</font>

1125
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,679
something calling a system interface

1126
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:32,049
when is something calling an executable

1127
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,809
one is someone calling a dynamic library

1128
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:37,809
versus a static library connection when

1129
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:39,519
is somebody just like you know sending

1130
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:42,219
through the network some command that

1131
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,749
execute<font color="#CCCCCC"> a command</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that creates a plug I</font>

1132
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,609
mean there's all these questions that

1133
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:48,249
come because a lot of these licenses the

1134
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:51,249
obligations come from linking right and

1135
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:54,368
and linking is a is a very fluidly

1136
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:56,319
defined thing right you know it's like

1137
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:59,109
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lua</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> script in a game</font>

1138
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,839
that then calls this thing what happens

1139
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:04,058
and and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1140
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,308
very few people who want to reach beyond

1141
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,079
beyond the boundaries of their software

1142
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:09,640
right with their licensing regime and

1143
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,479
the rest is just too hard to police and

1144
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,069
and the rest but it is a it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

1145
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:17,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting problem because this is also</font>

1146
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:20,619
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where charlatans and scammers and</font>

1147
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:23,140
and malicious people find solace they

1148
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:26,619
say no no I'm not using the GPL that way

1149
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:30,578
I i called it via system interface you

1150
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:31,720
know so it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying if i run</font>

1151
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:33,400
GCC

1152
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,899
windows is now open source and it's like

1153
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,840
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really what it says</font>

1154
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,250
you know and people say things like this

1155
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,680
all the time to hide from their

1156
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,849
obligations where they really should

1157
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gone with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bsd thing in the</font>

1158
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:49,119
first place anyways here's the text of

1159
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:51,970
the the we're all adults here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> f in</font>

1160
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,500
what WTF PL means is what the

1161
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:55,118
public license so do with the you

1162
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,550
want public license this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1163
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,900
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> document like wow this person is</font>

1164
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:01,390
embraced sharing it away we have never

credit Sam just wanted to share some

1167
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,530
code he's like here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go take it</font>

1168
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is in America in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wipo signatory</font>

1169
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,890
countries you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that that block of</font>

1170
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:16,830
capital letters in every license so

1171
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:20,140
copyright is actually a set of

1172
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,730
established enumerated rights for

1173
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,990
software there's seven of them soon

1174
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,720
they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aight but right now there's</font>

1175
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:28,149
seven of them and basically it's the the

1176
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,598
warranty of fitness all of these things

1177
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so without that you're vulnerable</font>

1178
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,280
and let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what you're</font>

1179
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,900
vulnerable to so if i say to Jim Jim I

1180
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x11 in my nuclear reactor is</font>

1181
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,420
it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best implementation of a</font>

1182
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:44,560
windowing system and you go sure it'll

1183
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,420
work great for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your nuclear</font>

1184
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,580
reactor now you think I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1185
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> characters I'm not right he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1186
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">said it was it was the right</font>

1187
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,820
implementation for me to use and if for

1188
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:58,420
some reason it doesn't work for me I can

1189
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:02,980
sue gym unless he has a no express

1190
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:04,060
warranty for fitness right if it you

1191
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,020
know there's all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things in</font>

1192
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,670
there so you should read that block

1193
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,140
attack some time but this is missing

1194
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,480
that so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ship</font>

1195
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,129
something under the WTF PL you can be

1196
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">sooo people are suit all the time for</font>

1197
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:15,820
this and they lose if they don't have

1198
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:20,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of language and Stan stated in</font>

1199
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:22,720
a contract with you so you shipping WTF

1200
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:24,160
PL is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad for you personally and so I</font>

1201
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,080
don't let any Googlers release under

1202
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,970
this license but we could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

1203
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,259
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> who cares if they're</font>

1204
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,790
vulnerable right there's a moral

1205
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,470
question but who cares if they're

1206
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:35,560
vulnerable if we use our software but

1207
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem is if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font>

1208
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,849
copyright actually works the problem

1209
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,890
would do what the you want is it's

1210
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">not clear if it's I get to do what the</font>

1211
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,890
 I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want or what the Jim wanted</font>

1212
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,540
by releasing it

1213
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:51,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we have this problem that I</font>

1214
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:54,040
get to you just do what the you

1215
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:59,200
want to so who's you who's what and

1216
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:04,420
so it's like it turns out sadly these

1217
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,950
are not legal terms right so so you can

1218
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,480
clarify it and what happens is people

1219
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,770
say well we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> will put in a</font>

1220
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,210
clarifying statement I'm like you're

1221
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,100
just writing us off for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a license then</font>

1222
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and the problem is people say well</font>

1223
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,860
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really sings under the public</font>

1224
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,470
domain but i can tell you something

1225
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,000
we're in France not right now we're in

1226
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:22,180
dallas which i guess is very not French

1227
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,230
and but if you're in France you really

1228
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,770
something I the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public what's your name</font>

1229
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're what's your name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Timo so you're</font>

1230
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:32,470
probably from like Finland right or

1231
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,990
Norway yeah so but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in french tip</font>

1232
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:39,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">France today okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> T most cells me a</font>

1233
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:41,560
piece of software and alter you're an

1234
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,300
artist so he tells me a piece of

1235
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,380
sculpture and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful sculpture</font>

1236
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,930
of something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important to</font>

1237
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,590
his people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> France and and then I sell</font>

1238
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:53,319
it to Jim for ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> times as much right</font>

1239
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:54,460
because I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make money so you told</font>

1240
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,200
to me for a thousand dollars i sold it

1241
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:00,040
to him for ten thousand you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey wait</font>

1242
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:03,850
a second where's my eye that's nine that

1243
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,770
way under the world of natural property

1244
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,330
organization in France your moral rights

1245
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,370
attached so you can come to me and say

1246
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:11,440
where's where's my cut and I have to

1247
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,060
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some money from that sale right</font>

1248
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,890
you can articulate those moral rights

1249
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:19,700
similarly suppose Jim is a neo-nazi he's

1250
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,040
not

1251
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,049
but suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> he is you can me say I don't</font>

1252
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">want no you can't tell my beautiful</font>

1253
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:30,740
sculpture freedom to a neo-nazi and you

1254
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:32,869
could stop the sale and you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1255
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,910
you would release it on the WTF PL you

1256
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,200
can still stop the sale if you lease it

1257
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,810
out of the public domain you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still</font>

1258
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,549
stop the sale so moral rights still

1259
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:42,140
attached right so there's all these

1260
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,089
questions that come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and in</font>

1261
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,500
fact with open source software licenses

1262
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:46,880
they don't address moral rights at all

1263
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,579
but they've been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> long enough that</font>

1264
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,440
the courts have come to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1265
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:53,750
you can actually licensed your software

1266
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,579
and moral rights stop attaching and they

1267
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:59,060
can be reproduced and all the rest so

1268
00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:00,800
open source can persist in France so

1269
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,240
yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with these licenses</font>

1270
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,400
is they're well-intentioned despite the

1271
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,868
potty mouth aspect they're very

1272
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,730
well-intentioned but we don't

1273
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:09,440
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't live in a world</font>

1274
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">where these intentions can be</font>

1275
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,050
articulated in this way so just use a

1276
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:20,299
bsd license for cripes sake or an MIT

1277
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:23,900
license if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're east coast that's all</font>

1278
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:29,290
of us our West siders again that was a

1279
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:31,579
rap joke that nobody got um so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

1280
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:33,339
another trap you even see how we doing

1281
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:37,420
on time what time is it I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna have</font>

1282
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:37,420
it's 10 till so I have 10 minutes

1283
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,710
I can be a little over because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1284
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,930
one starts at one o'clock right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

1285
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,310
can go fast so clas you'll be asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1286
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,020
sign a contributor license agreement if

1287
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,029
you give code<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to destroy the</font>

1288
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,500
whole place if you try to give code to

1289
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,590
the Free Software Foundation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Apache</font>

1291
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,230

1292
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,600
contributor license agreement we base

1293
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,570
ours exactly on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache foundation</font>

1294
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,950
one so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for you sure about</font>

1295
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,150
software foundation you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1296
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,250
trust the FSF to do what they're going

1297
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,460
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there says you're giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1298
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,690
an exclusive copyright right RSA you're

1299
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,680
giving us a non-exclusive so you can

1300
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:14,450
keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you want with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1301
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,950
code and we're going to release it as

1302
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,299
open source software right it basically

1303
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,080
says you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power to give us that</font>

1304
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,580
code but CLA some of them are really

1305
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,319
really grabby and I would never

1306
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,600
recommend signing a CLA unless it looked

1307
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly like the Apache one like ours</font>

1308
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:32,029
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because for the most part most</font>

1309
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,300
clas are good because they're based on

1310
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:37,340
the apache license or they're bad and

1311
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,500
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things like and any</font>

1312
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,420
patent you've ever filed becomes ours by

1313
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,650
the way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you might do that's</font>

1314
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,330
kind of related this becomes ours by the

1315
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,280
way and there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these little trap</font>

1316
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,420
closets to be very careful so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1317
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,330
are actually presented to people at

1318
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,530
hackathons so basically not all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1319
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">but probably about twenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the</font>

1320
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,440
hackathons out there that you might take

00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,150
part in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're quitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your job by</font>

00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,870

<font color="#CCCCCC">organizers so don't do that license</font>

1326
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:08,240
add-ons we see patent clauses as early

1327
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:11,029
as 1998 we saw people trying to

1328
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically say here's a real-time Linux</font>

1329
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,870
patch with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dyke and famously</font>

1330
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:17,750
did this but if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're gonna</font>

1331
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:19,400
be paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patent fee and so they</font>

1332
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,960
never adopted that they adopted other

1333
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,520
real-time Linux things but he still

1334
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,920
tried to see based on it it was really

1335
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,420
terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> crockford isms which will go</font>

1336
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,110
quickly into since we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running out of</font>

1337
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">time they say this offer will be fused</font>

1338
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,540
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and not evil now I'd like to</font>

1339
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that Google is not an evil place</font>

1340
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,380
but my flavor of good and evil is

1341
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,720
certainly different than what Doug might

1342
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,190
say and so we gotta we gotta release we

1343
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,259
don't have to have this sentence in our

1344
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,640
versions of jasmine same thing with IBM

1345
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,360
so he goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> around saying they can be</font>

1346
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,129
evil but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with these is that</font>

1347
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people used to</font>

1348
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,120
have add-ons to open-source licenses

1349
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,460
that said not to be used by this group

1350
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,410
that group<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know Jewish people</font>

1351
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,660
non-jewish people abortion clinics

1352
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,460
nuclear power plants<font color="#E5E5E5"> militaries and so</font>

1353
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,009
we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that was not okay in the</font>

1354
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:09,230
open source world but it sneaks back in

1355
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's been sneaking back in lately more</font>

1356
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,130
often where people try to control who

1357
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:15,590
can use the software based on their

1358
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,850
personal ethics and morals and sometimes

1359
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:21,050
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always aligned with</font>

1360
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:22,220
humanity finally I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste</font>

1361
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,450
any more time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you have to get to</font>

1362
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:26,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">the working groups really important that</font>

1363
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:28,480
you do that work so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

1364
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,430
terms of services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are terrible and</font>

1365
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,040
patent clauses that are terrible so for

1366
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,750
the web M<font color="#CCCCCC"> codex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we released from</font>

1367
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,060
google we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a patent closet said</font>

1368
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,890
here any patents we have here we're

1369
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,960
letting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have license to if you sue</font>

1370
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,250
us around these codecs you don't have

1371
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,650
license to them anymore we'll use them

1372
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,270
in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense so it's literally very</font>

1373
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,980
much like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache License patent</font>

1374
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:50,570
grant but there have been others lately

1375
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:56,090
that have come out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like this</font>

1376
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:57,080
and they say if you should sue them

1377
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,940
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's related to the</font>

1378
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,560
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lose rights it's like well</font>

1379
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,830
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little extreme but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

1380
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,440
says also if you should through any

1381
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,580
lawsuit assertion or other actions so

1382
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,330
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me ask you something do you think</font>

1383
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,920
that every patent ever filed is valid

1384
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:17,330
just raise your say<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm if you think</font>

1385
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,590
that every patent is valid anyone okay

1386
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:22,850
so every single one of you is now

1387
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:25,420
violated this this clause every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

1388
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of you and they can withdraw any</font>

1389
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:30,800
sort of patent rights and then they can

1390
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,330
use it to control you so this is out

1391
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,320
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now they're changing it</font>

1392
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,819
we've been talking with him that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1393
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">put X's instead of the company's name</font>

1394
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,750
because they they really want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1395
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,000
better but this was overreaching right

1396
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:43,970
this sort of thing happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have</font>

1397
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,010
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful and sadly you see a lot of</font>

1398
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,390
consortiums that are open standards

1399
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:49,700
organizations to name only you see this

1400
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the JCP you see this in some subsets</font>

1401
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> owais asst be careful the presence of</font>

1402
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,310
the word open<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not help you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian we</font>

1403
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:58,460
already talked about open daylight and I

1404
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:00,560
really think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco should try very</font>

1405
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:04,090
hard to be truly open and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

1406
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:07,060
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so I'm optimistic</font>

1407
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:09,010
and I'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap and saying running</font>

1408
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,060
code isn't all there is to it it's code

1409
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:13,180
that people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to use</font>

1410
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:15,460
without fear of rent-seeking and that

1411
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,350
way the code can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used everywhere on</font>

1412
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,000
