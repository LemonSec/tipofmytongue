12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:36,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">a flawed last time in 2006 when the ITF</font>

13
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:39,699
was here we had had a flood around the

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,800
hotel so we could not enter or leave Wow

15
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:44,138
well I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that didn't happen they</font>

said you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1200 somewhat people where</font>

17
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:49,030
were they from all over the place 57

18
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,039
countries which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty good turnout</font>

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,979
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the ITF we are an</font>

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,239
international organization everywhere

21
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,998
where people are working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology they they will be interested</font>

23
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">in coming now how many different working</font>

24
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:05,260
groups met this time about 100 we have a

25
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,630
128 working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group sold together and the</font>

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,580
idea great now there was a lot of code

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,229
and some hackathons and things happening

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,300
this time what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all about I see</font>

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,300
that on your shirt<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there right are</font>

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,560
and everything else yes so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,840
proud of the idea when we were working

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,690
on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that end up in real actual</font>

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,940
code out there in the real world or we

34
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,740
work on things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> new innovations</font>

35
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,070
and new prototypes are being being built

36
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,770
at time it's one example of this real

37
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,770
code thing as HTTP to standard that we

38
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,300
released a month ago and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we term end</font>

39
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,929
asst interest in various kinds of

40
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,320
implementations all the major browsers

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,270
have this or will have it soon on that

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,908
that's a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example things where</font>

43
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,310
standards actually end up out there in

44
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,960
the world quite quickly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time we</font>

45
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,409
tried something different also that not

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,539
just implements the standard from the

47
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,729
specification but also work on both in

48
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,310
parallel and particular try to link open

49
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,590
source and standards world together on

50
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,720
you know topics ranging from multicast

51
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,750
routing to video codecs this time so we

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,139
had about 50 people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> packing away in</font>

53
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,389
different small teams building things on

54
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,189
top of existing projects or creating new

55
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:19,269
project

56
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,640
so that's another example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of third</font>

57
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,430
examples that we had what we call the

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,159
code spring the day when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> program some</font>

59
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:31,060
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IEPs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own tools were doing in the</font>

60
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:34,149
ITF work now these events both happened

61
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,379
before the ITF weeks right so people had

62
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,019
to come in on the weekend so pretty

63
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,679
dedicated group of folks that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

64
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,750
yeah I've ever very<font color="#E5E5E5"> eager to the extent</font>

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,540
that when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when lumps arrived</font>

66
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,879
then no one came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat it because</font>

67
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,739
everyone was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so tied up with you know</font>

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacking away that you know no time for</font>

69
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,450
eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's great now will some of</font>

70
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">these tools be things that will see out</font>

71
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,480
announced you know to help move these

72
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,730
verticals along or yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of</font>

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,709
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> either existing projects that</font>

74
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,619
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know being has you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

75
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,590
video codecs being corrected or improved

76
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,500
and and some of them are new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

77
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,329
help us do our work better like

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,549
coordinate some things between ITF and

79
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,549
open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> world that's great it's</font>

80
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,349
great well the what else were some of

81
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,109
the hot topics that you that you thought

82
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,578
were need this week well many things

83
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">were you know in different working</font>

84
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,560
groups but the three things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

85
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,090
thought were interesting where our

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion with problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

87
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:41,709
international characters in<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifiers</font>

88
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,389
we also talked about video<font color="#E5E5E5"> codecs and we</font>

89
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,970
talked about data models to control

90
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,859
network nodes yeah i was there in part

91
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,019
of that video codec discussion that was

92
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:52,239
going on it was quite quite busy quite

93
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,190
engaged a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,979
be going on from there there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

95
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,349
some remote experience I'm obviously not

96
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:02,590
there with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Dallas no cowboy hat</font>

97
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:04,298
for me this time I'm I was remote and it

98
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,909
was an interesting experience we did

99
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:08,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">some microphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Q types of experiments</font>

100
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,629
to try to see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help promote</font>

101
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:13,449
people feel like they fit in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

102
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,069
bit better to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

103
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,419
great because for instance in a couple

104
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,029
working groups i was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise my</font>

105
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,620
virtual hand and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

106
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,299
into the room although the first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

107
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">did it they had the audio levels off so</font>

108
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was the voice of God echoing through</font>

109
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,050
the whole room that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there God's good</font>

110
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,849
people telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan you're too loud I</font>

111
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't do it</font>

112
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,990
but it was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I got that sorted as</font>

113
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,309
the week went on but you know it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

114
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">good way to try to bring in more people</font>

115
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:39,509
from around the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and</font>

116
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,789
you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still work to do it's</font>

117
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,520
not quite as easy as the experience of

118
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">being there but we're hoping to use ITF</font>

119
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,889
protocols to really try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

120
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so I guess with this meeting done</font>

121
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,869
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> next what happens where do we go</font>

122
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:57,959
from here well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to work of</font>

123
00:04:54,869 --> 00:05:00,149
course and over the net this time so so

124
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,639
we do most of our work over the internet

125
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:06,059
and our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical meeting will be at</font>

things that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing in Prague is</font>

128
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:13,409

129
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">time was the first we'll run the second</font>

130
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:18,808
