1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:11,150
happened today<font color="#E5E5E5"> so instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of talking</font>

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three different things will just</font>

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,520
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that we did during</font>

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,230
the week and have a discussion around it

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:24,049
then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a presentation about the</font>

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:26,720
open group and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sockem etsi i guess tony</font>

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,500
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be presenting TC cyber and</font>

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Sock'em and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3gpp siii and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sock'em and</font>

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,530
then we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,530
milestones and decide a way forward

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:46,449
there any agenda bashing that needs to

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:56,629
happen at this point any opinions nope

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:01:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if the remote presenters are</font>

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:06,259
available so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brant and Tony are both</font>

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:18,679
remote and did you see them in the

16
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:33,369
meetup over and you don't see either

17
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:33,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">them I'm actually not even in our room</font>

18
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:48,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">so if the remote presenters aren't</font>

19
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,299
available then we necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

20
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,299
really start with that

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I know okay okay then I guess we can</font>

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:25,050
start off with a the work report so I

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:32,780
have a blow to the side closest<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

24
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:34,740
upset do I go things today all right

25
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,020
let's see what do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go here</font>

26
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically we met three times and</font>

27
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,240
had a bunch of discussions along the way

28
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,260
at first<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that during the</font>

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">first session we talked a little bit</font>

30
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,769
about scope and then I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

31
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,930
a bad board so let's talk about focus

32
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,480
and and then ultimately we started

33
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,550
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about prioritization so we had a</font>

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,190
very long prioritization discussion and

35
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,740
I there seemed to be a consensus

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,600
throughout the discussion that we wanted

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk less about device type and more</font>

38
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the mechanisms of collection and</font>

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually will help focus our work</font>

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,480
between now and when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive the</font>

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,340
information model to more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a close and</font>

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,230
then get into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data model discussion</font>

43
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,890
where then prioritization is going to

44
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,890
become important we also from that had a

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,140
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion and it feels like we</font>

46
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,100
have some consensus that were interested

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:33,109
in state / behavior so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we're</font>

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,910
not going to go and it's not our goal to

49
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:39,450
verify that a web server will not

50
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,850
negotiate a week cipher suite though

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,530
it's configured to not negotiate a week

52
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,030
cipher suite we'll look at the

53
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,610
configuration but we won't necessarily

54
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,940
go and interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that web server to</font>

55
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,590
find out what it will actually do on the

56
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand we do want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find things</font>

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can get the state of things but</font>

58
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,160
I think that's kind of where we are

59
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,049
right now in the discussion so there's

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,660
later we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a little bit of an open</font>

61
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion about these things but</font>

62
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,620
basically that's that's where we are

63
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">heinous</font>

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,500
we definitely recognize that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,790
drive the information model home which

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically means get it to a working</font>

67
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,670
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> glass call state so then we can</font>

68
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,750
work on submitting it to iesg and

69
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,400
yesterday we came up with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> list of</font>

70
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,230
things that we might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

71
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,120
information model to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more or less</font>

72
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:34,340
complete we need models<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and these are</font>

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,960
kind of in plain terms just so we can

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,780
start with more or less shared

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,210
understanding Hank and some other people

76
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,359
have been working on defining more

77
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,909
explicitly defined terms and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,030
about that as well but we need models to

79
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,020
identify an endpoint identify hardware

80
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,489
inventory identify software inventory

81
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,210
describe available endpoint attributes

82
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,350
for a given hardware or software item

83
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,299
describes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ERV value of an endpoint</font>

84
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,850
attribute for a given hardware or

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,770
software item and then we have a

86
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,450
recognition that we basically have a

87
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,640
client sub client and it's not

88
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,860
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second component but some</font>

89
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,729
client on the endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> that provides the</font>

90
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,750
data or we interact<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a service that</font>

91
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:24,260
interacts with that client to get the

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:25,960
data so even in the quote agent lists

93
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,170
you know if you're interacting with a

94
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:33,409
network device for example and you

95
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,120
connect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shell that she'll is really</font>

96
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,800
the client that you're interacting with

97
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,840
to get the data that's what we mean by

98
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,280
client it's not necessarily a second

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,929
component that's doing the assessment

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:48,530
that would have to be installed on that

101
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:50,660
thing um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next sorry yeah so are you</font>

102
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">entertaining questions now or want to</font>

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the end second I have a couple</font>

104
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions but will you take them now</font>

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:08,260
or okay so my first one is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do</font>

106
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:12,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we need models so do eventually</font>

107
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:15,430
for ceases being like separate

108
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:20,479
deliverable or directories are kind of

109
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:23,300
sections<font color="#E5E5E5"> in using the same model I think</font>

110
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is a</font>

111
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,440
by ok so my impression at this point is

112
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most of these things at this level</font>

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,250
would be in the information model so the

114
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:34,400
information model kind of needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

115
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:39,050
these submodels in them more or less<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

116
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,000
we could have separate models I think

117
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that how they break out and drops is it</font>

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,919
is that your question no<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually my</font>

119
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,979
questions was how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you break those in</font>

120
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,650
models or if there are any advantages or

121
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:55,550
disadvantages on breaking them in

122
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:59,628
separate a smaller models or or managing

123
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:04,190
one bigger but more comprehensive model

124
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:07,340
oh yeah i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is yet to be</font>

125
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,110
determined<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody in the working</font>

126
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:22,909
group has opinions on that every week an

127
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:25,789
open discussion by the way this whole

128
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:29,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosted Ella Fitzgerald I can</font>

129
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:43,818
Tina Turner sony and chair and many

130
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:46,699
other famous artist seriously I think

131
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:49,789
what we described here there are pieces

132
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:52,610
of this bed it's us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can steal</font>

133
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">from other models that exist standard</font>

134
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,440
sizes and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be very easy</font>

135
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,120
to standardize on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks other sessions</font>

136
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,159
I'm even on Kate a lot will work for us

137
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,629
so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we actually break it down</font>

138
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,849
into separate models that would be very

139
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:11,719
valuable and help us progressed faster

140
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:13,729
ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> jinjja I'm trying to figure out</font>

141
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:18,469
exactly what is meant by<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe</font>

142
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:21,469
available to use is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the set</font>

143
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:23,090
of at least they could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that end</font>

144
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,400
point where this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attributes that</font>

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,830
I would say both<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kathleen Moriarty I'm</font>

148
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to second Jessica I was going</font>

149
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,180
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say something very similar</font>

150
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,670
because reusing existing models is going

151
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:49,589
to help you tremendously especially for

152
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:53,250
different device types and Dave ball

153
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:56,700
tomorrow I'd also like to +1 Jessica and

154
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:59,480
and then address Jim's question um I

155
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,150
think we really need two things we need

156
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,670
we needed a listing of all of the

157
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,980
available attributes that we can can

158
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,319
collect and evaluate for a given<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

159
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">point whether or not they're defined or</font>

160
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,790
defaulted or however that that mechanism

161
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,730
would work on on a given endpoint

162
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,980
because nine times out of ten we're not

163
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,070
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in collecting the</font>

164
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,870
full information that is available on

165
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,120
that end point we're generally going to

166
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,780
be interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some subset</font>

167
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,480
that is relevant to you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

168
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,030
organization's use so we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

169
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,920
to select from the menu of attributes

170
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,310
essentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to collect and</font>

171
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,689
evaluate and then additionally we need

172
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,030
another method of representing the

173
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,160
actual values that exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

174
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint for those for those attributes</font>

175
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,959
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really need both and there</font>

176
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:16,800
and both things are doing slightly

177
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:20,190
different things that's right when I do

178
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,400
you need to have is this is actually a

179
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:28,190
list of the values for which there will

180
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,189
be younger values that's correct

181
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,050
Christmas him so i might say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

182
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">a thing</font>

183
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,750
and the family<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we should can you</font>

184
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,510
move to a different life because that

185
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:58,660
one apparently is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for remote</font>

186
00:10:45,510 --> 00:11:05,439
people thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right sorry does</font>

187
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:08,469
this one on at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so should I</font>

188
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,390
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> osseo cert so I would</font>

189
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:16,060
like to say that you that we we should

190
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not try to figure out every piece of</font>

191
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:22,899
data that we could possibly have on the

192
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,579
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start from there instead we</font>

193
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,290
should understand that as the

194
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:28,029
requirements are written now and a

195
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,670
better way to potentially make progress

196
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:34,240
is to accept that we're going to accept

197
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:38,589
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different standards operating</font>

198
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:44,260
in in the space so sticks taxi I oh def

199
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:45,910
IP fix oval you no soup du jour all of

200
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,399
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be there well we</font>

201
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,730
should focus on is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key elements</font>

202
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,620
we need to be able to connect you know

203
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,380
the key identifier is going from an

204
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint to the collector from the</font>

205
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,649
collector to whatever repository from

206
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:05,469
the query capability to the repository

207
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:07,360
such that those things can then actually

208
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,810
operate on the data and understand what

209
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,720
data is available right and that data

210
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,660
can be in any of those formats so the

211
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,899
data model is data models from other

212
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,850
systems unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to tackle</font>

213
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,920
like kind of building the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one true ring</font>

214
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,510
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we should I think we</font>

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">should go with the scooby-doo decoder</font>

216
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:33,069
ring model and we should focus on doing

217
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,829
that piece instead right which means

218
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all those underlying data models</font>

219
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:42,939
are welcome they're already done

220
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:44,380
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor thinks that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

221
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,449
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever data model they have is</font>

222
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,970
the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing since sliced bread good</font>

223
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:50,040
for them

224
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:58,740
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an interoperability layer that</font>

225
00:12:50,040 --> 00:13:00,899
lets those things communicate so by

226
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,000
interoperability layer I mean there's

227
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,569
translation engines those used a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you mean I think if you want</font>

229
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:10,079
to make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good product in the market you</font>

230
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have to build that but I'm not</font>

231
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,599
interested or you know have any desire

232
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,819
to specify such a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right</font>

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,220
good because yeah that doesn't seem like

234
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:23,790
something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really followed from</font>

235
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,860
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying so I think what I</font>

236
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,689
I'm effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

237
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,019
have we would need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to define</font>

238
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:33,480
enough of an information model and data

239
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,720
model to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define the metadata</font>

240
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,779
of what gets put into the repository

241
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,360
such that you can arbitrarily determine

242
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,579
what's there that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use but then</font>

243
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,379
how you act on that that's a whole

244
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:50,219
nother problem that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

245
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:53,370
don't solve necessarily so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

246
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,319
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard so looking at you know a</font>

247
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">few of us in the room we have to worry</font>

248
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:00,029
about different things so taking off my

249
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:05,129
ad hat at emc we have to worry about

250
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:08,309
storage and that right now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

251
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:17,660
popular interface is a restful interface

252
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:21,120
with me just a second recall with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

253
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:27,029
would let<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole project on this no</font>

254
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,930
wait one no no no the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data model so</font>

255
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:35,670
it's it's not in the IETF it's a DM TF

256
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:39,888
set of standards and<font color="#CCCCCC"> symptom same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

257
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,300
part of it and then sm is is another so

258
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,189
you know to put on other interfaces

259
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,680
would be tough then you know Nancy's

260
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:52,050
dealing with yang modules and you know

261
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,359
the list goes on and on yeah but we

262
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,579
should not dunno much kind of speaking

263
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,350
so should not forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are talking</font>

264
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,920
here about the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> model which</font>

265
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:04,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the higher level</font>

266
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,670
protocol independent while the real

267
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:10,540
interoperability will be measured<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

268
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">data model level with instantiates in</font>

269
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,529
specific data modeling languages

270
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,089
information model yeah so my point is

271
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:22,730
more that we're checking for very

272
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:24,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things yeah so I think I want</font>

273
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,730
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and regurgitate because I oh</font>

274
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:35,899
sorry I'm Nancy what's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> camwyn</font>

275
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:42,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">jet like I'm not awake yet um so I think</font>

276
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with Chris in the sense that the</font>

277
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:49,430
way I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an information model is</font>

278
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:52,660
the abstraction of the different types

279
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:56,449
of information and the interactions or

280
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,880
operations that need to occur how they

281
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:01,399
get instantiated into a particular data

282
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,790
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe is a group we have</font>

283
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,790
agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many and again</font>

284
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,980
to reiterate to Kathleen's point the

285
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:14,060
data model is yet another level of

286
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,570
extraction that out of scope for us in

287
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:21,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">the group how we do the storage</font>

288
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,630
considerations underneath is up to the

289
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,760
implementers because there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

290
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:31,820
optimizations on data size deployment

291
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:34,550
size and all of that so while I like the

292
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,190
focus and there's these lists of things

293
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,719
right I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

294
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,660
we're staying still for the information

295
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,709
model we're staying at the abstraction

296
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to allow for the sticks the text sorry</font>

297
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:54,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks yeah all the flavors to come I</font>

298
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,689
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all of that too and I think</font>

299
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,569
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat what is meant</font>

300
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,240
by by this right because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

301
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:05,869
saying that we're going to enumerate how

302
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,780
you check for minimum password length

303
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:12,198
for microsoft windows or red hat linux

304
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,750
or you know all of the other variations

305
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist on that on that theme right</font>

306
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:22,459
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about here is how do</font>

307
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:24,589
we generalize a way to record to allow

308
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,280
those things to be instantiated in a

309
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:30,649
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would allow for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

310
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,389
interoperability I think that's what

311
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,960
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about here both at</font>

312
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:40,310
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Information model level and I think</font>

313
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,320
likely at a data model level as well so

314
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kristen hacia I don't want necessarily</font>

315
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,399
to create interoperability at a data

316
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,690
model level I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reality is if</font>

317
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,280
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make progress it's going</font>

318
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,310
to be caveat<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emperor a little bit of</font>

319
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,020
buyer beware because if you're going to

320
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:00,290
accept multiple data models into your

321
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,990
ecosystem then you know interaction and

322
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,899
multiple data models is just too hard

323
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,030
it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too long and to that</font>

324
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,060
point it's not clear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that you need</font>

325
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,129
to identify what a hardware how to do or

326
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,350
handle a hardware inventory and I don't

327
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,060
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we need to</font>

328
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,639
understand or do how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify a</font>

329
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,139
software inventory what we potentially

330
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,320
need to do is understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

331
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:27,230
code points that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

332
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Swedes we could have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CPEs we should</font>

333
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,880
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> information model and our data</font>

334
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,710
model should allow the exchange of those

335
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,960
types of data points to between sockem

336
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,660
components and you know how does that

337
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,610
interoperate however the implementer

338
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,610
makes it interoperate that's up to them
