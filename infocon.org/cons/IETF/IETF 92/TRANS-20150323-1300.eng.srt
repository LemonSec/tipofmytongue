00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,820
you

00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:49,240
yeah is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron there if Aaron or been our</font>

3
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:54,730
aankhen one of them say hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he did</font>

4
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,860
leave how about Ben it could somebody

5
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:02,740
done run down the hall instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I</font>

6
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:04,510
guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

7
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:17,590
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> move ahead with the gossip</font>

8
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:22,059
discussion hello I'm Daniel<font color="#CCCCCC"> con</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gilmore</font>

9
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:26,049
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linus Nordberg and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have worked on</font>

10
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:28,020
the draft about how to how we use gossip

11
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:33,879
in this certificate transparency model

12
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:36,370
to try to provide additional additional

13
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,679
checks on some of the players in the in

14
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,199
the CTE ecosystem I think Steve's

15
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,440
description of this as a complex system

16
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,669
with lots of moving parts is definitely

17
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,169
something to be concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

18
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:49,510
the gossip draft rise to address that

19
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,309
specifically with the goal of trying to

20
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,610
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the logs are not</font>

21
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:58,210
misbehaving so just wanted to clarify

22
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,820
this right the goal of the gossip is to

23
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,649
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the logs are are doing</font>

24
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,990
what they claim that they would do so

25
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:08,408
logs need to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

26
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,500
honoring the MMD the minimum merge delay

27
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:12,429
i think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> got that acronym right and</font>

28
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,770
then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

29
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:17,440
also they shouldn't be presenting split

30
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:20,080
views of the history that they provide

31
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like two different clients query them</font>

32
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,020
they shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide one</font>

33
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,320
view to one client and another v to

34
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,879
another and the folks who are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

35
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,408
we've called them auditors traditionally

36
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've noticed some discussion in the</font>

37
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:32,620
landless that we're dropping the term

38
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,990
auditor or something and i'm actually a

39
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,590
little surprised by that maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i missed</font>

40
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">that part of the discussion so we have</font>

41
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,820
traditionally called the folks who are

42
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:45,100
checking up on the logs auditors

43
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,360
so I'm using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> term still here if</font>

44
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,590
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be using that then</font>

45
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should call it</font>

46
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's a different job than the</font>

47
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,860
monitoring job yeah we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we it's</font>

48
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,750
not decided yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open but for the</font>

49
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,479
purpose of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session we all know you</font>

50
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:05,350
know auditor we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sounds</font>

51
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">good so next slide please so so looking</font>

52
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,370
at the we spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a while looking at</font>

53
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different players in the CT</font>

54
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,908
ecosystem and it seems obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

55
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,100
you do that the work of a monitor is

56
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:17,649
probably involves quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

57
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,209
and doing quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with the</font>

58
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">log it seems likely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that pretty much</font>

59
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,779
every monitor is also going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

60
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,549
auditor effectively but there may be

61
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:26,710
parties that can act as auditors that

62
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,149
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to act as monitors the</font>

63
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitor is effectively getting all of</font>

64
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:31,600
the data from the log and reviewing it

65
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,860
to see whether things have been included

66
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,689
that shouldn't have been included and

67
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,939
the auditor is doing slightly less work

68
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,279
they're doing sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consistency proofs</font>

69
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,799
and inclusion proofs and making sure

70
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,269
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things show up properly so</font>

71
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,100
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> on those are monitors but we</font>

72
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:50,139
expect probably all monitors would be

73
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:51,580
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to act as auditors so the biggest</font>

74
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:53,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that we ran into in trying to</font>

75
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,330
spec this out is a privacy issue with

76
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,189
gossip so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that when you're</font>

77
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,189
collecting these s cts from peers that

78
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:02,320
you communicate with that information is

79
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,820
analogous to your browser history or

80
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,879
something comparable at least to the web

81
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,740
space and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some there's</font>

82
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,168
definitely some sensitive associations

83
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,700
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to broadcast</font>

84
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:14,620
everywhere and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

85
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,029
gossip as a way to like keep track make

86
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,000
sure everyone's seeing the same thing I

87
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:20,620
may not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say hey by the way</font>

88
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
you know I'm a regular like I've visited

89
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,699
cat fanciers<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm yesterday because you</font>

90
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,080
know I might be with the good people who

91
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,970
prefer dogs two cats so so the

92
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,289
relationship between the clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers are things that we want to</font>

94
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:35,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect in terms of privacy the</font>

95
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,970
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other players</font>

96
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,559
in the ecosystem we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care so much</font>

97
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,240
about privacy if people disagree with

98
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,440
that I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear it but from</font>

99
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it looks like everybody</font>

100
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">else is sort of acting in a public way</font>

101
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,460
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship between clients and</font>

102
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,879
servers is a thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

103
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">protect so that that drove our decisions</font>

104
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:55,120
about how gossip is supposed to work

105
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,350
next is so the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font>

106
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,549
gossiped in order

107
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,730
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone sort of seeing</font>

108
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:03,639
the same view of the world well in

109
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:06,250
individual auditors can gossip sign tree

110
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,360
heads to each other so for it if there

111
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,340
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple auditors who are both</font>

112
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,500
trying to keep it a certain log honest

113
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,178
they can share sign Trina tree heads

114
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,460
amongst each other and then they can

115
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,140
pairwise look for consistency proofs

116
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,280
from the log for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different century</font>

117
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,270
as if they've seen so that tends to

118
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,010
protect against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the log presenting</font>

119
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,450
split view of the world two different

120
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,910
auditors and two different two different

121
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,429
log clients the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

122
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:33,159
server operators and auditors can share

123
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:36,970
any s cts that they've seen so that is

124
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:40,360
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I run cat fanciers calm and I want to</font>

125
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,400
and I want it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make sure</font>

126
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the logs that I'm working with have</font>

127
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,049
honored the various promises they've

128
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,090
made the MMD and so forth I can send

129
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:53,168
them all of the s cts i've ever seen for

130
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:55,449
myself now<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally you say well what</font>

131
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:56,799
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna see for yourself and most</font>

132
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,270
servers aren't going to automatically

133
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,190
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

134
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,110
extra s cts for themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the third</font>

135
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,730
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the puzzle is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the client a</font>

136
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,189
client talking to a server can say hey

137
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,179
I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> some other s cts for you and</font>

138
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,530
here they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and here are the</font>

139
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,200
certificates that went with them and

140
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,600
then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that keeps that particular</font>

141
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,039
relationship confidential because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

142
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,570
the server now we talked to the auditor

143
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,490
and says hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what I'm seeing</font>

144
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,990
about myself clients can also talk to

145
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:23,200
auditors directly if they have a trust

146
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:25,090
relationship with them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

147
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,409
required and<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be required for</font>

148
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,080
clients or to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this work</font>

149
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:30,159
so next slide please it's just a

150
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,320
graphical visualization of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

151
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">just talking about so these are all the</font>

152
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,970
players<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the current yuko system</font>

153
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,260
without and gossip right so the monitor

154
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying hey give me</font>

155
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,700
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the log the website is</font>

156
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,070
asking for us SCT from the log that

157
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:49,270
might happen mediated by CA or it might

158
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:51,280
happen live the browser is communicating

159
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:54,429
with the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> https</font>

160
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,200
context our gossip only actually works

161
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,850
specifically for<font color="#E5E5E5"> https it doesn't work</font>

162
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,030
for other TLS mechanisms at the moment

163
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">so be aware of that and then the auditor</font>

164
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,510
is doing these different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

165
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,299
asking given a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to sign</font>

166
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,799
tree head given to sign tree heads I

167
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,029
want to consistency proof and given<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

168
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign tree head and</font>

169
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,440
SCT I want an<font color="#E5E5E5"> inclusion proof so this is</font>

170
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:16,379
without gossip it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already a</font>

171
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,989
complicated system next slide please

172
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:21,789
good gossip so the auditors talk to each

173
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:25,359
other and share their span tree heads

174
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">signed tree heads the browser</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will say</font>

175
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,769
to the website hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's some other s</font>

176
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,359
cts inserts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen for you so</font>

177
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:34,059
the website maybe can build<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cache of</font>

178
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,499
those the website then talks to the

179
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:37,210
auditor either the auditor pulls the

180
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:38,499
website or their website ghost daughter

181
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,479
and says hey here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things that</font>

182
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:43,109
I've found so the auditor is collecting

183
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:45,999
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tree heads and s cts and</font>

184
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:47,289
then that dashed red arrow that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

185
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:50,139
trusted relationship there where the

186
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:52,629
browser acknowledges that the auditor is

187
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:54,849
likely is likely able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

188
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">D anonymize them or learn their traffic</font>

189
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,210
habits or whatever if they if the

190
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,158
browser does have a trusted relationship

191
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,019
with an auditor they can send the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s cts</font>

192
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,429
inserts if they've seen to the auditor

193
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,859
as well the auditor now has this

194
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:07,839
collection of<font color="#CCCCCC"> s cts and s th s and can</font>

195
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,339
get the various proofs from the log to

196
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,739
show that the log is behaving properly

197
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:16,690
so that's the that's the outline for how

198
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:20,649
we expect gossip to work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS did I</font>

199
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:23,739
thoroughly confuse people<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

200
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:26,498
slide so open questions as i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

201
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:31,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">https only our proposal if you read the</font>

202
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:32,019
draft users<font color="#CCCCCC"> well known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> urls between the</font>

203
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,820
different parties and there's a

204
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:36,479
specification for what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to the</font>

205
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:39,369
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> urls so that gossip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can work</font>

206
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:41,679
we mentioned that auditors if they're

207
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:43,299
receiving information as a trusted party

208
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,219
from clients that they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

209
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:47,289
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> then send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that trusted that</font>

210
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:49,330
information on to the log<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

211
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:52,239
there's a traffic analysis attack where

212
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,309
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanna if I let's say I want to know</font>

213
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,389
what what a given clients activity tends

214
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,899
to be I know that they have a trust

215
00:28:55,389 --> 00:29:00,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship with a with an auditor I</font>

216
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,830
can sit at the network on that auditor

217
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:04,239
watch the requests come in from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

218
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,460
client that I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you need it if</font>

219
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:08,409
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted I can then see what</font>

220
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,869
requests come out from the auditor in

221
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:13,330
that form and then I can infer something

222
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:15,519
about what the client was asking and

223
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,228
learn something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client so we</font>

224
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,450
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that auditors actually mix</font>

225
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:21,039
information in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this detection is</font>

226
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,860
going to be done after the fact anyway

227
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,420
like once none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to prove</font>

228
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,010
a connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> from occurring right this</font>

229
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,340
is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening offline so a little bit</font>

230
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:32,559
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra latency for the mix will</font>

231
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,850
provide a level of privacy for the

232
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,160
clients who have a trusted relationship

233
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,709
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> auditor but we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

234
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,059
explicit mix policy to find and then

235
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,770
there's an open question about how the

236
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,110
auditor talks to the server whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

237
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:46,270
pole or how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> would note should it</font>

238
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pull vs send there may be a business</font>

239
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,879
relationship that's defined there

240
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:53,799
between servers at all so so that's what

241
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,420
we sorted out we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

242
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">different options of other ways that you</font>

243
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,890
could try to gossip and pretty much all

244
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,770
of them seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run afoul of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

245
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,390
concerns about basically browsers

246
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:13,540
revealing their history to the peers of

247
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:15,549
their gossiping with so questions the

248
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,840
sneak can't be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end first I want to</font>

249
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,480
thank you that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> those were</font>

250
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,159
beautiful diagrams and that the first

one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the before adding in the</font>

252
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,160
audit parts belongs in 69-62 bisque or

253
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,110
in an architecture document because it

254
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,630
does the clearest job of explaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,230

257
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:38,918
outstanding thing to do I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

258
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:44,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do SVG nrcs yet now you have to turn</font>

259
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:46,870
into ascii art<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now second though at</font>

260
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,200
various points you talk about clients

261
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's some inconsistent</font>

use between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you're using the</font>

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,470
all the other elements being clients of

logs I see and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

267
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:08,110
clients as TLS clients which I believe

268
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,549
correct yeah it's really good that may

269
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,439
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the draft that have to reread</font>

272
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:18,390
important that we get consistency in

273
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:22,260
terms of the terminology<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute and I</font>

274
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,260
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good work thank you</font>

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter so how often</font>

278
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:48,429
do you envision the TLS client browser

sending s cts to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> auditor we haven't</font>

this for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to effectively detect in</font>

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,350
some point reconnect to the legitimate

286
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,940
server or have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these trusted</font>

287
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,889
relationships to an auditor we will not

288
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,990
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to detect it in that case the</font>

00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">frequency of sending the SE of the</font>

290
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,230
seeing the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones we haven't sorted</font>

291
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,730
that out if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have recommendations at</font>

292
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,380
the equity here now I mean I I'm

293
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,730
assuming that brothers will only do it

294
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,600
when they see something new or you know

295
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,860
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not going to send</font>

296
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,030
for every connection but there's no it's

297
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,469
not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an every connection it's</font>

298
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,360
actually a separate it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

299
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,670
separate post to the web site using the

300
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,740
well-known URL if you're right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

301
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,660
don't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean to the auditor in</font>

302
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,720
particular so as it is the browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

303
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,640
sending bad so to the website it will

304
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,650
only say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will send s cts that it</font>

305
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,090
didn't like if it's seen a bunch of s

306
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,520
cts for a given site then they'll send

307
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,409
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that site right now as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far as what</font>

308
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,010
it sends to the auditor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect it was</font>

309
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:53,500
it should send everything to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> auditor</font>

310
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,270
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again local client policy we do make</font>

311
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,800
a point that if your if your user agent

312
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,200
allows the user to do things like delete

313
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,290
cookies at history it should also delete

314
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,880
this local cache I just worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

315
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,070
scalability of an auditor trying to

316
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,470
collect records for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

317
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,260
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> auditor being able to implement</font>

318
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,580
that successfully in a scalable way so

319
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,990
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not expecting that every single</font>

320
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,510
connection would result in being

321
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:20,050
kickback the user agents are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

322
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:21,640
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same su tease multiple times as</font>

323
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,159
they visit they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

324
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:31,330
them every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time that they see it</font>

325
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:33,580
so yeah hi Rick Andrew semantics I like

326
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:36,310
the picture too would you please add cas

327
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,590
as another bubble because only<font color="#CCCCCC"> fda's can</font>

328
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,490
send free certs sure no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> else can</font>

329
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,350
send priests arts

330
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:47,860
okay thanks I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud to tackling from</font>

331
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,780
Java and C Peters said start TLS an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SMTP</font>

332
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:54,010
why not include it and I have an answer

333
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:58,210
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garber learner's says it says HTTPS</font>

334
00:33:54,010 --> 00:34:00,190
l through then says in the short in the

335
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,470
long run yes maybe include have family

336
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,920
started there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very few smtp sorts or</font>

337
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,929
CIA issued and then separately then said

338
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,429
he imagined browser sending schs to

339
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:11,350
websites and vice versa look at those

340
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,060
answering a different point so I guess

341
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,489
the question initially was smtp and

342
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,659
start to us so for smtp insert see less

343
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,459
the reason that we didn't define it for

344
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:21,340
them is because our our feedback

345
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:24,940
mechanism from browsers to websites or

346
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,409
browsers to servers I can't say clients

347
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,119
servers anymore now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> see point of</font>

348
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:33,790
that is HTTPS so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that we're</font>

349
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,190
doing smtp s we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a guaranteed</font>

350
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,210
mechanism for delivery so someone wants

351
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:40,270
to spec out what that would look like

352
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,970
how to gossip back to a server that

353
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:46,929
supports smtp s then that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

354
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we SPECT it out for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> https maybe it's</font>

355
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:57,790
a new smtp verb<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok on do people feel</font>

356
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:01,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a correct model for gossip</font>

357
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:04,180
for CT and gossip and consensus

358
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:06,300
protocols can be incredibly complex this

359
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:10,210
one's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty simple approach on</font>

360
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the detective how do i do people feel</font>

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this work should go forward your</font>

364
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for generic solution that needs to</font>

365
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:35,290
deal with the TLS certificates using

366
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:40,299
HTTP and limiting ourselves to web HTTPS

367
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:41,970
traffic is sort of not enough i agree

368
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it would be better to cover other</font>

369
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,209
regions but this is this is what we've

370
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,400
got at the moment right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

371
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">in local this is what's in our charter</font>

372
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what are ya</font>

373
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,190
right and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

374
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,680
possibility of additional applications

375
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,690
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future but for what's what's</font>

376
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:11,480
defined as in the Charter right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

377
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">PPS one more thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will make</font>

378
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:23,790
deployment of TLS with other protocols

379
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:27,690
and let's advance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's secure so</font>

380
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:29,790
vanished in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java rumors I think he's</font>

381
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">changed we wanted to say so I'll give</font>

382
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,000
his original comment so as I said I

383
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,860
thought st<font color="#CCCCCC"> agents should go from</font>

384
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,280
browsers or strictly auditors actually

385
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to websites and vice versa and then</font>

386
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,450
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said so revise my comment as</font>

387
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,880
auditors to websites in vice versa so he

388
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:48,990
wants auditors and websites to exchange

389
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:58,820
s th s so i'm i'm not sure what a

390
00:36:48,990 --> 00:37:02,759
website would do with an s th yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

391
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,230
so so so been on I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk it</font>

392
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,480
would give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to another auditors I</font>

393
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,950
would give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another auditor so</font>

394
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,170
we've got this auditor to auditor

395
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,210
feedback loop going on here and so

396
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,560
you're saying so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben suggestion is then</font>

397
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites could have relationships</font>

398
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,029
with multiple auditors and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s th s</font>

399
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,980
could be passed auditor to auditor via

400
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,380
the website as an interim measure I

401
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,060
would hope that auditors would be

402
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,880
interested in communicating<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each</font>

403
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,230
other so that seems like an indirect

404
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,060
route and i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we need the</font>

405
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,930
indirect route yeah and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't that</font>

406
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,580
doesn't understand he's singing<font color="#CCCCCC"> she says</font>

407
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,279
exactly so particularly since<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

408
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:41,819
browsers will the auditors and so have

409
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:45,680
no direct road so he's saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

410
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">browsers will be auditors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

411
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,480
reintroduces all of the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns</font>

412
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:54,060
the main advantage of the auditors being

413
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,760
independent from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser is that it</font>

414
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,710
is that these queries here sorry I'm

415
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,660
pointing maybe I'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

416
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,020
the queries between the auditor and the

417
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,049
log are things that provide privacy

418
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,930
sensitive information

419
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,790
and so if the browser if the if the

420
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,910
browser actually contains the auditor

421
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,140
then the browser is basically reporting

422
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,440
back to the log all of the things that

423
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,240
they've seen and so so our assumption

424
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,980
here was that auditors were independent

425
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,089
from browsers and that the that the

426
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,470
auditors are providing a layer of mixing

427
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,570
to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular privacy</font>

428
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,209
implication so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think that all</font>

429
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:34,210
browsers our auditors then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually now</font>

430
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,250
have concerns about this draft so he

431
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">says sths do not reveal what you have</font>

432
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,990
seen but he agrees with the other

433
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:43,210
concern yes I I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not claiming that they</font>

434
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,479
handing back the sths are the issue it's

435
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:49,810
the it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser's being auditors</font>

436
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:59,260
that's the issue how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

437
00:38:49,810 --> 00:39:00,790
read this document Wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um given</font>

438
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's probably premature to talk</font>

439
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,050
about adoption and you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

440
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">means to UM people to or at least looked</font>

441
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:11,530
at it before we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> making it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

442
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:14,890
working to deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> both it looks really</font>

443
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,900
good so we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and push people to</font>

444
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:20,650
give it to review and then we'll talk

445
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:23,290
about adoption on the mailing list hey

446
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,560
thank you and how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing on audio</font>

447
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,560
now

448
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,700
hey can you hear me yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who's that</font>

449
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:46,520
is that Aaron aaronus yeah okay

450
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:49,460
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is an errand</font>

451
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:55,180
Masseria he's put on he's remote it

452
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:58,760
looks like this is european size paper

453
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,759
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i apologize it's not the UH</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's off</font>

454
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,670
the left edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the screen okay um so</font>

455
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:09,370
he's gonna walk through he's yeah and i

456
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,370
will i'll read the first couple of our

457
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:19,490
yeah okay there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I'm so</font>

458
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,560
Aaron you're on yeah okay so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically I</font>

459
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:24,979
want to go over the open issues the goal

460
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:28,549
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks what what's left</font>

461
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,710
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cm16 62 this and do we start the</font>

462
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:34,880
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list for on some of</font>

463
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:36,470
them to reach closure next slide after

464
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,100
we were in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> component slide so in the</font>

465
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:42,020
busy able to go over dishes according to

466
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the component so the one the first one</font>

467
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:48,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones iterative at all RFC 696 to</font>

468
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,580
be directly and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a bunch of</font>

469
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,900
issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are related to climb</font>

470
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,330
behavior and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability regional agenda</font>

471
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,280
item for that and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 client</font>

472
00:40:53,330 --> 00:41:00,200
privacy there is only one issue there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

473
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:03,500
next slide okay so this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

474
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,680
list of awful tickets if you can go two

475
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:11,090
more slides to the slider treats ticket

476
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,129
for yes so ticket for is about selling

477
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,740
the TV a certificate part both for

478
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,720
certificates and play certificates and

479
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,850
which implies excluding the signature

480
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,939
and signature parameters from the

481
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:25,520
signature in their City size of the BK x

482
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,100
time and the benefits is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

483
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,390
consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the first certificate</font>

484
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,440
but and that will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that if the</font>

485
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,950
signature parameters are incorrectly

486
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,370
encoded looks wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam so we had</font>

487
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:43,669
a problem where if the signature

488
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:45,890
algorithm identifier was corrupt in the

489
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">unset part of the certificates open</font>

490
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:51,020
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example will process it</font>

491
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,890
regardless of their corruption which

492
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">means different variations when the same</font>

493
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:59,060
certificate by just changing their

494
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:02,360
signature parameters could be logged

495
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,759
multiple times spamming the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logs so</font>

496
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,270
signing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TB certificate will avoid</font>

497
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,090
this problem and overall some of the

498
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:14,060
authors think it's a good idea the

499
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:16,700
downside is that the signature itself we

500
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,400
see will be included in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be</font>

501
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered by the SCT and as things stand</font>

502
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,740
now basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be impossible</font>

503
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,470
sort of to polish the final signature

504
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,990
because the log went quickly when asked

505
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,250
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entry will provide the entry</font>

506
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:34,040
itself which one includes a TV

507
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:37,850
significant and the chain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear it</font>

508
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:42,560
which will exclude them sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> and entity</font>

509
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:47,440
certificate so that's so this is of this

510
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you have to once next slide please</font>

511
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:56,620
stick it n is about delivery of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacifica</font>

512
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:58,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">densities through other mechanisms</font>

513
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:02,299
mechanisms other than embedding a

514
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:04,850
certificate so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in RC 696 to the origin</font>

515
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,530
of the city implies whether if if it's

516
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,569
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Pacific eight or a certificate</font>

517
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,130
if this basically is embedded in the

518
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,870
certificate then aqua states for the

519
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:15,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bristol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult of the certificate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

520
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:18,290
if it's provide to the test<font color="#E5E5E5"> to retailers</font>

521
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:20,240
Accenture or stay below 60 response it's

522
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,130
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final like for a final</font>

523
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,870
certificate and this ticket suggests

524
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,760
allowing delivery of birth certificate I

525
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,220
cities<font color="#E5E5E5"> over tailored extension or a</font>

526
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,890
staple<font color="#CCCCCC"> doses response and that is useful</font>

527
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:36,230
mainly for for name reduction right so

528
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:39,950
in case yes like a CA would want to log

529
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:42,230
a redacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty certificate after it</font>

530
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,120
is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> being issued and would like</font>

531
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,650
to serve additional s cities over

532
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,370
Taylor's extension then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way to</font>

533
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:54,530
do it would be to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pre</font>

534
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:57,420
certificate is like this for Pacifica so

535
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">did the motivation for this ticket and I</font>

536
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,110
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the suggestions was to</font>

537
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,330
define a backwards compatible structure

538
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,890
that will contain US cities and will

539
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,250
still be used in the same tale as

540
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,410
extension than<font color="#CCCCCC"> stapled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ocsp responds so</font>

541
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:14,630
the one question is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

542
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:16,980
use the same Tillis extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if so</font>

543
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,810
how should you define<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the structure</font>

544
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,160
of this the backwards compatible

545
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,320
structure for containing like a new

546
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,859
style cities which will have the type

547
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:34,050
embedded in them and all style cities

548
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:36,840
next like this so the threaten stiff

549
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:39,330
can't cover that<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detail so I think</font>

550
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is no point of getting to that and</font>

551
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:48,810
next slide please<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so tickets 53 is</font>

552
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,000
about the ordering of entries in the log

553
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,910
so almost all the current

554
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,410
implementations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current RFC</font>

555
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,330
incorporate entries in the order they

556
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,460
were submitted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a</font>

557
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,290
requirement and the document should make

558
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,590
it clear that a client should not expect

559
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:06,000
this behavior so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the local</font>

560
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,880
incorporates all the entries that were

561
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,900
submitted within a given time period<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MFD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> m that is services of compliant</font>

563
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,800
or at least it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement to</font>

564
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,350
incorporate for the law to incorporate

565
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:27,810
the entry submissions in the order they

566
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:30,360
were sent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing at least so</font>

567
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,070
this ticket for security considerations

568
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,650
was suggested as a middle ground between

569
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:36,510
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> mandated Klan behavior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

570
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,910
specifically install and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

571
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">your done that given the wrist like a</font>

572
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,000
whole discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about climbing ever</font>

573
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:49,440
which is grown since this ticket was

574
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,330
found next to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide please ok</font>

575
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,910
so this ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about limiting the</font>

576
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:56,640
number of off sign three heads<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tell</font>

577
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:59,009
Alicia's per time unit and the goal is

578
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to avoid contouring a printing or</font>

579
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the log sending a different</font>

580
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,819
sign three head for each channel which

581
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,820
get the theater<font color="#E5E5E5"> quest</font>

582
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:23,009
so it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question no no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay as</font>

583
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:29,490
for a sorry can you go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

584
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:31,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">previous slide so okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what this I</font>

585
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,529
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this suggestion is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overall</font>

586
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,029
sensible except we don't have a good way

587
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:39,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to enforce it in the moment because it</font>

588
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:42,599
so if along<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do that lacking gossip</font>

589
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,609
we will not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out that</font>

590
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,799
so the log is doing or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it couldn't do</font>

591
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:48,650
it for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans and at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

592
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:51,900
there is no good<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to detect it so</font>

593
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:54,869
suggesting some data welcome and there's

594
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:57,690
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> much fun yeah Aaron this is Steve</font>

595
00:46:54,869 --> 00:47:00,750
can't BBM so I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused by</font>

596
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:04,109
the choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> of words in the first bullet</font>

597
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:06,720
here ticket calls for maximizing number

598
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:09,180
of st<font color="#CCCCCC"> h's and yet what you said which</font>

599
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,029
makes more sense to me is limiting the

600
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:14,609
number of sths per unit time yeah oh

601
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:17,490
yeah you are i did see it's a typo it's

602
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:23,069
the opposite okay yes because for

603
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:27,569
minimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good I forgotten do sth is</font>

604
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:29,759
have a timestamp and or serial number so

605
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:32,190
that the best engines have been evident

606
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:35,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm stamping the tree size and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

607
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:38,369
of dash so technically a local issue

608
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:39,779
that multiple stages for the same for

609
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sentry size with the same route us</font>

610
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:48,539
just because just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by firing the time</font>

611
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">stamp yes i agree but that seems like</font>

612
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:56,180
something so if if you added to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the log</font>

613
00:47:51,990 --> 00:48:00,569
metadata not only a maximum time between

614
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:03,269
issuing sths but also a maximum number

615
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:07,109
per some unit of time that you agree

616
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:09,930
upon couldn't an audit function detect

617
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:14,759
by looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sths that had been</font>

618
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:17,339
acquired if the log were to exceed that

619
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:19,150
limit that it had publicly advertised

620
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:22,640
through the metadata

621
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:24,470
yes I mean that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensible okay</font>

622
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,509
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just once I make sure I</font>

623
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:28,549
understood maximizing versus minimizing

624
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:29,960
it seemed to me the third bullet that

625
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:33,049
there was a way to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

626
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:38,420
detection of this oh thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

627
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:41,680
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide yeah if</font>

628
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,680
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more questions about this one</font>

629
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:47,720
so as I said about<font color="#E5E5E5"> client here dark 20</font>

630
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:50,150
tickets and I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to list them</font>

631
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,488
all partly because the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracker</font>

632
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:55,579
started this inning out 500 errors when

633
00:48:52,489 --> 00:49:00,400
I was looking at them so I think we'll

634
00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:00,400
just talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it later next slide</font>

635
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:07,130
client privacy ticket number 88 and that

636
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:09,079
is in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> together is a suggestion to</font>

637
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:11,569
preserve the client privacy by batch

638
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,180
fetching inclusion proofs so when the

639
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:16,759
client asks the lock for an occlusion

640
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,919
proof of a specific entry it discloses

641
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:22,390
to the log which Selena Kate it's

642
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:27,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">holding simply which site is visited and</font>

643
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:30,979
one suggestion is to send or to request

644
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:35,599
a bunch of proofs around a given time

645
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:38,419
stamp or or some bits of the hash and so

646
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,799
the log doesn't know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> which which</font>

647
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,630
certificate defines<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

648
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:45,469
only it knows about range or collection

649
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:47,509
of them and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so this is a sort of</font>

650
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:49,430
significant change or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a significant</font>

651
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:51,829
effort for logs to implement we have to

652
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:54,440
sort of specified carefully and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

653
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:56,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">not entirely sure it preserves privacy</font>

654
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:00,829
well enough there are suggestions for

655
00:49:56,509 --> 00:50:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">four in an iterative version of of this</font>

656
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:05,089
approach where a client keeps asking the

657
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:06,499
log for what's the window size<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how</font>

658
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:08,930
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificates do have in this time</font>

659
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:10,999
range or for this for this number of

660
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:13,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Auschwitz until the client gets an</font>

661
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:15,459
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's happy with and then fetches</font>

662
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:20,869
the inclusion proof batch for this range

663
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:24,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've to the point where it stands</font>

664
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:27,200
now is the postponing this this ticket

665
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,960
so it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not block RCS 696 to this</font>

666
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,770
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get better feedback both on</font>

667
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,940
the feasibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

668
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:36,980
reckon ism and the weather the privacy

669
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:42,920
insurances this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism provides are</font>

670
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:44,720
good enough and yeah this vid this it's

671
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">for my presentation and is there any</font>

672
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:53,569
questions on this side are there any

673
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:59,450
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much ok</font>

674
00:50:53,570 --> 00:51:10,660
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> now housing the house been doing</font>

675
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:10,660
with audio<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Ben are you there</font>

676
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:30,740
any word from them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is there anybody</font>

677
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:36,020
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team that can present the</font>

678
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:40,490
slides and lead the discussion is that

679
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:43,190
Aaron are you up to the task<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yeah I</font>

680
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:46,479
can cover Ben's presentation as well so

681
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,480
obviously I'm this for me to everything

682
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,840
redeco is is on the job

683
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:10,180
actually while we waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this to</font>

684
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,560
get straightened out one of the things

685
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:13,230
that was on the agenda that we don't

686
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have a presentation per se but</font>

687
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,960
it's come up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of times and</font>

688
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,970
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit to talk about there</font>

689
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,619
and that's the status of the client

690
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:23,259
behavior work and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not there's</font>

691
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:25,450
interest in starting a new piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

692
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,940
on developing a document describing the

693
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:30,220
client behavior and I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

694
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,950
you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time to get stuff</font>

695
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:37,589
together but not if you've got it you

696
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:41,770
know anything to say about this yeah

697
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point is their interest</font>

698
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:52,690
in starting work on a document

699
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:55,900
describing client behavior yeah we've

700
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:59,200
got one yeah um one person indicated

701
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,760
interest um is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody who feels</font>

702
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,180
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is inappropriate out of scope</font>

703
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:08,740
premature too late and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

704
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:12,730
shouldn't be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so basically</font>

705
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:14,080
we've got a lack of enthusiasm basically

706
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,540
well this will go out to the mailing

707
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">list as well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please give us some</font>

708
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:23,910
thought how<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we doing</font>

709
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,940
if there is interested in adopting the

710
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:42,730
work or is there other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people interested</font>

711
00:53:36,940 --> 00:54:04,780
in participating as editors one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

712
00:53:42,730 --> 00:54:08,110
Steve yeah okay is van up yet um it's

713
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:14,980
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can let's um is I could Aaron can</font>

714
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:17,680
can scare this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the time being okay</font>

715
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,270
Allah unless van will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

716
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,609
later draining and present i'll be i'll

717
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:28,290
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to go race so so when they</font>

718
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:32,380
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the lot of a lot of work on</font>

719
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:35,350
on the draft like is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> editor awesome</font>

720
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:38,650
and surprisingly shuttup of addressing a

721
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:40,390
ticket every day which he did for for a

722
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">long while which was awesome because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

723
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:44,140
lot of small things got fixed but also

724
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:46,839
surprising because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolved or closed</font>

725
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:49,540
some of the bugs which some people felt

726
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,060
were not really addressed which i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

727
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:56,230
since they have been reopened by the way

728
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:57,820
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yes i think it's a it's a shame</font>

729
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,860
that he can't presented himself because

730
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:04,600
a lot of that is is obviously his work

731
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as tall as this sort of statuses all</font>

732
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,100
of the like historical tickets and like

733
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:11,350
small from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one solid small changes</font>

734
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,420
some of the bigger changes are are now

735
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,540
resolved and I've mailed the least while

736
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,940
ago with the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> results tickets so</font>

737
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:24,790
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not go over them here next like</font>

738
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:26,980
this we will just recover some of the

739
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,620
big changes the first of them was

740
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,830
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> school the basically the option</font>

741
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:35,560
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client asking for sth and getting</font>

742
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,390
getting it from front end a of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock</font>

743
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:41,328
server and then requesting

744
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:44,509
like a recent inclusion proof against

745
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:46,819
this stage but that request ends up<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

746
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:48,529
ever be<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fronting bit</font>

747
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:53,779
different from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> furnace a log which</font>

748
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:55,400
only has the has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> alder st h and when</font>

749
00:55:53,779 --> 00:55:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client tries to then get a new stage</font>

750
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,920
it gets it from front<font color="#CCCCCC"> a day so the</font>

751
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,839
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> can never really get the the</font>

752
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:08,900
right inclusion proof for the sth it

753
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:10,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">holds so all other aps were updated to</font>

754
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,230
with basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow this front end</font>

755
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to specify everything it has including</font>

756
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:18,589
an old st age or<font color="#CCCCCC"> new or sth if it has</font>

757
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:20,029
one so the clients no longer has to go

758
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:22,670
and request each of them individually or

759
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:25,670
at least if it does it can get in your

760
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:28,460
answer if the load has one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

761
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:31,549
for st ages the log will provide also if

762
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,859
the client requests an inclusion / for

763
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:35,990
example for another stage the log can

764
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:38,150
provide the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new stage a consistency</font>

765
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:43,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">proved between the two and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> included</font>

766
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:43,420
proof for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new sth next like this</font>

767
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:51,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">echoes yes so when as i did a bunch of</font>

768
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine readable error codes to all the</font>

769
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:57,559
responses this is mostly useful when

770
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:02,569
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> when the client has to either</font>

771
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:03,890
retry or the request is malformed so now

772
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:05,509
it should click should be clear for

773
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:07,190
example when a chain is<font color="#E5E5E5"> submitted</font>

774
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:09,349
whether it was not accepted because

775
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:11,630
dedicate itself was invalid or because

776
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:16,119
they routed changed to is not included

777
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the set of fruits the log-log accepts</font>

next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please ok so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

779
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:30,348
efficiency issue that was resolve this

780
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:32,720
is related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the prison when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

781
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:35,079
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> where now the client doesn't</font>

782
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,939
have to perform three calls to get

783
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:39,259
included proof you know for example will

784
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,329
be like any fresher stage because this

785
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:44,480
is approved between the two stages so it

786
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:46,150
resonate vehicle to the all three screen

787
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:54,890
one go

788
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:56,569
next slide this venison in this section

789
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:00,308
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rubbing the metadata and did it we</font>

790
00:57:56,569 --> 00:58:03,109
try to the log the of the log parameters

791
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:05,989
including the ability to to freeze the

792
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:10,308
log so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is final accepted</font>

793
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:17,989
sth the format for the metadata itself

794
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:20,839
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> specified and yeah basically did</font>

795
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:24,410
that's what every client needs to sort

796
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:30,019
of to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a log and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

797
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:31,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">to conforms to the RFC and I suggest it</font>

798
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:33,019
is never brought up this ticket have a

799
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:38,079
look at this and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

800
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:38,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">the metadata is card next slide please</font>

801
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:56,509
so for algorithm agility the dude<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

802
00:58:54,410 --> 00:59:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the suggested resolution for this</font>

803
00:58:56,509 --> 00:59:02,089
ticket is that if if allah wants to

804
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:04,729
change algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> harsher with no</font>

805
00:59:02,089 --> 00:59:08,359
signature algorithm this simplest way in

806
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:10,910
terms of protocol simplifying the

807
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:14,690
protocol and making clients lives easy

808
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:20,269
is just freeze the existing log and

809
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:22,309
start a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so and if it is it is</font>

810
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:23,959
possible just to feed the old data the

811
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,699
data from the old log<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the new log</font>

812
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:30,019
to have it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> heaven you dog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include a</font>

813
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:32,749
copy of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant data so rather</font>

814
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:34,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">than trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to build in agility into the</font>

815
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:36,859
protocol which will make it

816
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:39,920
significantly more complex because then

817
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:42,670
each entry the logos to<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicate which</font>

818
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:47,269
algorithm was used to sign each entry

819
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:49,400
will and will make obviously life of

820
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:52,519
clients much more difficult this is

821
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,819
there so there's a proposed solution we

822
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:59,569
have a question yes Steve can't be the

823
00:59:55,819 --> 01:00:00,890
end first I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to thank you for having</font>

824
00:59:59,569 --> 01:00:03,469
I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> done two of the things that are</font>

825
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,959
cited in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides one adding machine</font>

826
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:08,420
readable error codes to the responses i

827
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:09,979
think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good and to putting</font>

828
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,009
together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current version of the</font>

829
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:14,718
document all the log metadata in one

830
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:17,900
place and describing format is very

831
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,680
valuable however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did file a ticket on</font>

832
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:23,329
the algorithm agility part because this

833
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,459
describes a mechanism by which to do it

834
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:28,160
but it does not provide a comprehensive

835
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:30,019
description of algorithm agility in the

836
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,209
way other systems have done and I

837
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:34,848
provided a reference there so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

838
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:36,348
this is a step in the right direction in

839
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:38,769
terms of saying this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we plan to</font>

840
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:42,410
deal with it but I would disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

841
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:44,269
this solves the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> also just for</font>

842
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:46,430
the heck of it I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> having the words</font>

843
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google confidential and proprietary and</font>

844
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,640
the bottom of each slide is probably not

845
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:54,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do for IETF</font>

846
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,129
presentations yeah that's absolutely ok

847
01:00:56,829 --> 01:01:05,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">so about the holiday the confidentiality</font>

848
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:07,609
notice it's Ben's fault but about the

849
01:01:05,059 --> 01:01:09,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">algorithmic duty so just I understand</font>

850
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:13,328
the concern and this is about not having

851
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:18,410
like a well-described or<font color="#E5E5E5"> well specified</font>

852
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:22,249
list of steps of how to migrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a log or</font>

853
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:24,680
how to migrate a client from the old log

854
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:27,890
which with sort of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is into a</font>

855
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:30,799
new log with a different algorithm is it

856
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:34,339
right I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's basically true if</font>

857
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:38,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC that I cited as an</font>

858
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:40,699
example it describes the phases that one

859
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:42,440
goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of may ensuring</font>

860
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:44,209
that there's continuity of operation

861
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,309
that that clients don't suddenly

862
01:01:44,209 --> 01:01:50,419
discover that what they were doing

863
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:52,069
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work now etc so I'm not</font>

864
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,069
saying you have to go to as much detail

865
01:01:52,069 --> 01:02:00,019
as in that RFC because that was dealing

866
01:01:55,069 --> 01:02:01,459
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system that was trying to deal</font>

867
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:03,499
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that could change in very</font>

868
01:02:01,459 --> 01:02:07,430
different time scales some of which

869
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:09,828
could be quite long but I think a more

870
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:11,930
detailed description that everybody

871
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:13,460
could read and from a client perspective

872
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:14,810
for all the different

873
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:17,720
flavors of clients that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are involved</font>

874
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:19,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">here that it tells them exactly what it</font>

875
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,379
is they'll need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do how they are</font>

876
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:24,530
expected to detect this and how they're

877
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:27,410
expected to deal with it including for

878
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:29,900
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the context of audits if</font>

879
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:31,399
auditing functions are supposed to deal

880
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:34,430
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibility of funny stuff</font>

881
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,230
happening across what appears to be an

882
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:38,480
algorithm change boundary then how do we

883
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:41,440
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one wasn't just freezing a log</font>

884
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,910
and starting a new one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide</font>

885
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:48,619
inconsistencies for example so that has

886
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:51,140
to be addressed at some level huh so I

887
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:52,400
agree I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um it's I think</font>

888
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,129
it's like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a very good point</font>

889
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,490
right we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear how sort of a</font>

890
01:02:55,130 --> 01:03:00,650
client's of my grades from logs I think

891
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:02,689
it's like it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> device it it's related</font>

892
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:04,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a incremental deployment which is an</font>

893
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:07,010
issue if the developer correctly you've

894
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,839
also raised in the past and somewhat to

895
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:11,420
climb behavior right so what how should

896
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:13,640
watch a decline<font color="#CCCCCC"> do how should the client</font>

897
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,560
know that a new arm that the new log is

898
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:18,259
being deployed and should replace an old

899
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,869
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

900
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:23,000
generally interested in documenting I'm

901
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:25,369
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what's of the right format or</font>

902
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,400
forum for doing that because what I can

903
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:32,420
document is the particular experience

904
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,280
we've had for one specific pls client

905
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:37,310
that we've implemented not for

906
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:39,440
everything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there is it like a</font>

907
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:41,029
right forum or right way to document

908
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i'll be happy to do that and</font>

909
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:45,770
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> include these sort of concerns</font>

910
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:55,070
or suggestions on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle this</font>

911
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:58,210
this lot of migrations as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

912
01:03:55,070 --> 01:04:03,050
there don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> appear to be more questions</font>

913
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um so since we</font>

914
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:07,880
completed our agenda I'm does<font color="#CCCCCC"> ben have</font>

915
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything additionally then by the way</font>

anything else I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're done I</font>

919
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,780
questions about adoption of the the

01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:38,799
a question is what's the kind of

925
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:43,029
expectation for timing now for the best

926
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:45,070
document on it appears that I I think

927
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:47,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is to have it all of open</font>

issues resolved by the next IETF which

929
