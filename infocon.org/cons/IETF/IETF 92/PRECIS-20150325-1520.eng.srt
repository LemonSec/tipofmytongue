20
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:48,340
one document the problem statement like

21
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,948
a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago framework is in</font>

22
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,159
our theater<font color="#CCCCCC"> sku and we have two</font>

23

have Peter was prepared a few slides on

27
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,959
the the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two documents I think what</font>

28
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:47,229
we have met new ler Miller that as

29
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:50,410
submitted is a shepherd review but then

30
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:55,270
a nickname the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shepherd doesn't sent</font>

31
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:58,740
this is right up so that's one missing I

32
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,740
guess from the process point of view

33
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so</font>

34
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:15,199
this is Barry your ad has a question is

35
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:18,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">there anything related to lucid or other</font>

36
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:20,930
things of that nature that makes you

37
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,729
want me to hold up on these or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

38

want me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to charge ahead and process them</font>

39
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,740
next week I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed that</font>

40
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,719
in length in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the frame about the</font>

41
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,790
framework and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea was essentially</font>

42
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,149
we add some text that says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know be</font>

43
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:38,120
careful and and the same is true with

44
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,470
these two document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cut right that's</font>

45

51
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:08,060
channeling audio from him that I should

52
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:11,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">have but so I'll do with the slides so</font>

53
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:16,489
framework done a proof for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fabrication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

54
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:22,000
registry is done the code points the

55
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:24,380
table are done and Peter where is the

56
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,060
reviewing the table to make sure that

57
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,279
all the cool points are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then</font>

58
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,638
we'll send its ok then they will this

59
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:37,209
will trigger the the arts editor to

60
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,209
publish so you may get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few days</font>

61
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:51,949

63
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:58,519
changed since<font color="#E5E5E5"> Honolulu the username</font>

profile got split into two for

65
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:08,149
case-insensitive case insensitive and

66
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:11,310
then basically the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> was brought</font>

67
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:15,450
in sync with the framework changes and

68
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:17,339
dates but for the most part I've well it

69
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:22,140
is it is done we believe it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

70
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:25,740
working group for I TFS<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cole I was just</font>

71
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:30,449
talking to Barry I think what we'll ask

72
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,790
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of apps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Directorate</font>

73
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:37,790
reviewers for this that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one</font>

74
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,790
way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting you know more of yours</font>

75
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:50,490
nickname somewhat similar updated and

76
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,650
from the other address working group

77
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,950
last call feedback and ready to go for

78
00:11:52,650 --> 00:12:05,540
ITF last call xmpp this has been X MPP

79
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:09,630
sweat<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2061 22 this is referring to these</font>

80
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:13,170
is has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working group last call in</font>

81
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> too well in the XP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XMPP working</font>

82
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:20,339
group and then in you know

83
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:23,910
simultaneously in pracy and we think

84
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,700
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going ready for ITF last call</font>

85
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,110
however this is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the XMPP side so</font>

86
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:35,220
it's more for your information I guess

87
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:37,350
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just I have a question on this</font>

88
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,310
there is some comments a question I

89
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">think my general question is the ad okay</font>

90
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,660
and is anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing for you apart</font>

91
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,050

92
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,050
up and

93
00:12:53,209 --> 00:13:00,779

124
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,319
saint-andre regarding sasal prep this we

125
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,300
received quite a bit of feedback a long

126
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,190
time ago from people like Nico Williams

127
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,449
and perhaps you could ask them for a

128
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,450
sanity check at this time

129
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:45,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">andrew sullivan on the mapping document</font>

130
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,079
on this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe anticipating a little</font>

131
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,779
bit too much the next agenda item but

132
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:53,739
you know we just heard in the in the

133
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:55,630
lucid Boff<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion that one of the</font>

134
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">directions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could end up going if</font>

135
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:01,860
we don't have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of we know how if we</font>

136
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,810
don't have success with a property is

137
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,029
essentially a significant mapping

138
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,369
document probably a significant bit of

139
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:12,070
advice now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure whether it's the</font>

140
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">same mapping and that is what's not</font>

141
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,300
clear to me so I I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually</font>

142
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an opinion on which way to go but</font>

143
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,359
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that one of the things</font>

144
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could ask yourself is whether it</font>

145
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better to see how that proceeds</font>

146
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,420
in order to proceed with the mapping

147
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:32,920
document or to publish this and then do

148
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:38,050
another one later well we my I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

149
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:42,969
personal point is that not thing as with

150
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:45,790
I DNA mapping is pretty important for

151
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:50,649
most of the customers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

152
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:54,250
priests<font color="#E5E5E5"> priests</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II so and then right now</font>

153
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:58,209
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a rough idea of maybe something</font>

154
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:01,180
that may we may work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Unicode so it</font>

155
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,459
looks like to be more appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

156
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a full package of pc that could</font>

157
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:10,089
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do and then rev it because</font>

158
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:15,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know mrs. Peake Resnick I mean I</font>

159
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:18,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more important point is I'm</font>

160
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,438
guessing it's very likely that the

161
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,109
mapping kind of stuff we would do to

162
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,000
deal with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucid issues even if we</font>

163
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,250
get to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

164
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,530
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the kind of mapping</font>

165
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,600
that's being described as sort of a more

166
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:35,590
general here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kinds of things you</font>

167
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,780
could do mapping wise<font color="#CCCCCC"> um they're dealing</font>

168
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">with very different looking problem</font>

169
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,299
spaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they will of if we go</font>

170
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,850
down that path and lucid I think they

171
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,660
will end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up converging but I think marks</font>

172
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,879
right there's

173
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,350
the utility enough of the current

174
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,640
mapping document that we should probably

175
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:59,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">go ship it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do a rev if they converge</font>

176
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:04,430
and in the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeffers someone said you</font>

177
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do some similar</font>

178
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:10,540
to what PC framework says which is a bit

179
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:14,199
of you know heads up of you know warning

180
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:16,760
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm again this is andrew I i</font>

181
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm fine with all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not i</font>

182
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,610
actually just don't have an opinion but

183
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:26,090
i'm i'm conscious of what i think it was

184
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:29,030
chris said in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multiple versions is</font>

185
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,209
maybe a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so just just a thing to</font>

186
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,210
consider

187
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:59,090
okay um well we're a good segue to the

188
00:18:45,560 --> 00:19:05,300
other so this the next item on yes

189
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:08,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">getdata a DJ from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John cleansing so Mike</font>

190
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,490
it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that if we are going to</font>

191
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,300
publish mapping now it better contain

192
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:17,150
very strong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> receipt warnings and</font>

193
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:20,419
another channel is mike i think that

194
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:27,410
view is consistent with that with fat PT

195
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:29,240
saying so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what will i think we will</font>

196
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:33,080
review when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new version</font>

197
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,990
comes out of the document and see you

198
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,889
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether if you need to do</font>

199
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:45,830
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more or less depending segue</font>

200
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:48,320
to the placeholder of will do we need in

201
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">proceeded to think about you see this is</font>

202
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:57,379
or what what happens in a couple of

203
00:19:51,410 --> 00:20:00,800
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last two hours we know what</font>

204
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,650
but what would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> but maybe 11</font>

205
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,409
question to the ideas is especially the

206
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,040
right own to to start this this you know

207
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:12,220
preview see the work or not or doesn't

208
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,220
matter

209
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,160
sorry before that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ask an ignorant</font>

210
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,740
question for somebody who had a conflict

211
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:32,400
is there one sentence or one paragraph

212
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:35,130
summary of lucid well I think you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

213
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you laugh is indicative but which</font>

214
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of suspected but okay well the</font>

215
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,480
ones yeah i guess the summary and so

216
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:49,980
Andrew went through the the issues and

217
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,170
then proposed five possible directions

218
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,580
we could take to deal with them the

219
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:59,070
issue of course is how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

220
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,110
characters that come that changes in the

221
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:05,870
character set from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Unicode that that</font>

222
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:09,840
break the situation that we expect and

223
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:13,260
we looked at the five directions and

224
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,320
added a sixth and then took a hum and as

225
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:20,340
I was as I remember it the direction

226
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,470
that we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> was best was to try to</font>

227
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:28,649
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the Unicode people to come up</font>

228
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a new property on characters or a</font>

229
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:35,400
new set of properties on characters that

230
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:38,580
we could synthesize a our prop a derived

231
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:43,230
property from that would help us and or

232
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:47,790
create an NF I normalization<font color="#CCCCCC"> format for</font>

233
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:51,060
IETF that again well for identify as

234
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:53,310
whatever that would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that that</font>

235
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,840
would that would have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font>

236
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:59,970
we'd have to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with Unicode as</font>

237
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:02,310
well and that the back the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up of</font>

238
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,290
that is to say well we have to put

239
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:08,190
warnings about where you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

240
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,930
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't think we decided</font>

241
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,410
and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> the similar one of</font>

242
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,660
warnings was how did what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we call it</font>

243
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,910
and one lane bundling and blood bundling

244
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,650
of the situation bundling and blocking

245
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,200
blocking certain characters bundling

246
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,410
certain characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> education ready</font>

247
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,170
protocol they where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do this</font>

248
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,640
work is was left up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

249
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:36,720
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these guys up front are</font>

250
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:40,820
asking us now this is andrew i think the

251
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:46,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would add to that is</font>

252
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:48,649
it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear at least to me but</font>

253
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,629
that could just be that my brain is i

254
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:57,540
think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it shriveled a couple</font>

255
00:22:51,630 --> 00:23:00,660
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago on that that we have an</font>

256
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:05,659
understanding of what kind of property

257
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,660
exactly it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be so there is a</font>

258
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:11,010
potentially very serious problem that we

259
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,689
know we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got something that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

260
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:16,140
describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we don't know what it what</font>

261
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:19,040
that description is and we could wander

262
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,770
around in the dark for a very long time

263
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing that that did leave me</font>

264
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:28,050
feeling a little sad at the end of that

265
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,750
discussion was that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to agree</font>

266
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there was a property or maybe</font>

267
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,460
several that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to describe and</font>

268
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:40,110
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought about well look at the</font>

269
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,910
tremendous energy and you know output

270
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,439
that happened in this working group how

271
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,310
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to get everything going and</font>

272
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,650
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> worries me a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

273
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,510
if we don't get the engagement from the

274
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,370
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to consume this in</font>

275
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to sort of figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and hammer</font>

276
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,479
out exactly how we're going to how we're

277
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,190
going to work on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

278
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,370
we'll get the property<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we'll end</font>

279
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,710
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a lot of</font>

280
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,760
speculation and and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

281
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:13,200
because my sorry to ramble here I

282
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,270
haven't formulated this very well my my

283
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,640
interactions with people who are active

284
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:20,580
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Unicode suggests to me that there are</font>

285
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are sympathetic to the idea</font>

286
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,889
that we need I mean there are people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

287
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,170
are not sympathetic but then there are

288
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,850
people who are sympathetic to the idea

289
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,070
that maybe we need a property or two

290
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,850
here but they want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe</font>

291
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,830
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is clear distinct</font>

292
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:38,370
distinguishable and and sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

293
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,370
algorithmic and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

294
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do quite</font>

295
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,270
to work some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may have security</font>

296
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,820
implications and I don't know if we're

297
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,950
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the pollination across the</font>

298
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,300
area that maybe we need for that so that

299
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:54,580
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the only thing that I</font>

300
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,740
would I would raise this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pete again I'm</font>

301
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,320
much more bushy tail than andrew is so

302
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,290
let me see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can lay out why quickly</font>

303
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,919
first of all the end of the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

304
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:08,200
heard a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well the work</font>

305
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,780
that we would invest at least the

306
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,400
upfront work we even invest in trying to

307
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,639
work with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Unicode consortium and get</font>

308
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,590
them what that property means is pretty

309
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,450
much equivalent to the work we would

310
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,889
invest to try and come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of</font>

311
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,990
warnings or bundling rules and

312
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,840
everything else that goes with the other

313
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,809
choice so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not wasted work in either</font>

314
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,050
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and some of it is agree I</font>

315
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:34,629
agree hard but that that works going to

316
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,490
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done one way or the other the</font>

317
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,370
other but that I'm a little more saying

318
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:44,160
when than Andrew<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is with regard to</font>

319
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:47,678
the Unicode consortium simply because I

320
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the work that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do here</font>

321
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not stuff that we sorry guys one</font>

322
00:25:51,610 --> 00:26:01,899
meeting place is not stuff that we can

323
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly do on our own right figuring</font>

324
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what that property is and what is</font>

325
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,380
even plausible to do is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

326
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,510
is going to be an interactive process

327
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,030
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Unicode that we're going to have to</font>

328
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,309
say is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a distinguishable thing that</font>

329
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,200
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with and part of</font>

330
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,910
figuring out what it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

331
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,740
missing is going to be part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

332
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,670
conversation I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation</font>

333
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,960
is worth having one way or the other um

334
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,460
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose the thread here</font>

335
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,820
because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain is about as mushy as</font>

336
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:36,760
Andrews um the oh the other thing that

337
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,620
he said was we're gonna have to get the

338
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are wanting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

339
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,500
profiles again involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

340
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:47,020
conversation I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually um</font>

341
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:50,620
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> marginally true if it's true at all</font>

342
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,429
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went through the process</font>

343
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,119
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

344
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:59,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the particular compromise we made</font>

345
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are characters that are</font>

346
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,249
distinguishable within script and

347
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:06,019
therefore you know and have

348
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:09,139
distinguishable properties and therefore

349
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to use as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers so we made a</font>

350
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:13,070
category error we didn't get what we

351
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,259
thought we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

352
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:19,369
have to go through the process of asking

353
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:21,440
all those implementers again what they

354
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:23,629
want I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out with</font>

355
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the unicode consortium whether we can</font>

356
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:28,519
actually instantiate what we thought we

357
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,309
wanted with properties that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

358
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,259
provide so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

359
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:34,820
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and redo all</font>

360
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:38,240
the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did here I don't even</font>

361
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it I'll</font>

362
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,429
push back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the penultimate thing that</font>

363
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,019
you said that so getting getting anybody

364
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,059
else involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the</font>

365
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:50,029
consumers of this stuff involved is a

366
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,580
non-starter agree with that no one

367
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,490
except a handful of people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

368
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,960
anything to do with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sausage</font>

369
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:02,809
even if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat the sausage but</font>

370
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have here a specific instance of</font>

371
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:09,139
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks our assumptions</font>

372
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:13,879
and makes us<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do this the</font>

373
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:15,740
ultimate properties we want is well this

374
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:19,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this character that's safe to use an</font>

375
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,169
identifier is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's too generic the</font>

376
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:22,999
trouble is that the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Unicode</font>

377
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,669
changes something they may change a

378
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,919
different aspect of things that causes

379
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:29,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> characters to be unsafe to combine</font>

380
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,269
with other characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> and identifiers</font>

381
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:34,220
and so this may be an iterative<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

382
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:36,289
getting either getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

383
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,690
properties or getting the same property

384
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,539
applied differently in the future when

385
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Unicode 7.2 or eight point 0 or whatever</font>

386
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:50,539

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:52,699
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no oh I've just I'm</font>

388
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">really bad in this planning of this</font>

389
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,770
meeting but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask a secretary</font>

390
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,360
or any<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe so it would</font>

391
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,670
and given that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting a</font>

392
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,949
discussion we would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it you</font>

393
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:07,520
know somewhat in some place any

394
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:19,550
volunteer for scribing at least when

395
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:29,780
starting from now please listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

396
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:30,830
mp3 later<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks um sure right and I can</font>

397
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably remember to how to write down</font>

398
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:40,550
what I say Jim shot so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

399
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:43,610
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I guess barrier Andrew how</font>

400
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:47,060
wet percentage of what this property

401
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:48,919
needs to be do we currently think we

402
00:29:47,060 --> 00:30:00,950
actually understand and know how to

403
00:29:48,920 --> 00:30:03,530
write down what are I was going to say

404
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:07,040
that as a consumer of this information

405
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a consumer of these rules maybe I can</font>

406
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:16,460
express<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladakh sorry as a consumer of</font>

407
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,200
these rules I can express at least the

408
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:25,010
particular use case that I am looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

409
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,500
and it may actually turn in to a way of

410
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:30,410
describing this property this mythical

411
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,230
property that we're talking about which

412
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I go out and I</font>

413
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:41,060
fetch a public key for a particular

414
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,130
email address and I get back a public

415
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,800
key that has a slightly different

416
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,150
identifiers on it than what the user

417
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:52,879
input how do I compare those two strings

418
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:56,780
to differentiate a situation where it's

419
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,330
a substitution attack vs just a

420
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:03,200
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of expressing the same</font>

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:23,029
dots over it and presumably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human</font>

427
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:27,260
would assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> both of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font>

428
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:31,429
equivalent but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a computer would not so</font>

429
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:34,820
if a user types in Zurich<font color="#E5E5E5"> with or</font>

430
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:39,080
without the dots over the you presumably

431
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:42,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">it should match something now when we're</font>

432
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,178
talking about a property maybe that is a

433
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:48,260
good way of describing it precisely

434
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:51,140
because if we compare this to how when

435
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,090
we do a search and again I'm an American

436
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,179
all I speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> english so i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

437
00:31:53,090 --> 00:32:00,139
examples from english you have the

438
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:02,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">option of searching for a word where you</font>

439
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:06,529
preserve the case or you don't preserve

440
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:10,668
the case and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm starting to think that</font>

441
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:14,059
that's the type of property<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

442
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:18,580
for these identifiers where you can

443
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:21,559
conduct a search and you look for

444
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:24,789
equivalent representations of the same

445
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:28,070
character but don't necessarily match

446
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:31,908
alternate characters that look similar

447
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,649
but are actually different and that is a

448
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,659
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the you with the dots</font>

449
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:39,529
over it versus the you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

450
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:42,980
different and if you have this property

451
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:46,190
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> expressed programmatically then</font>

452
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,049
you can conduct the search first for the

453
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,350
exact normalized string that was

454
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:55,279
provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you get a match return</font>

455
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,799
it if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a match you can also</font>

456
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,380
write the protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> spec such that the</font>

457
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:04,908
server would presumably conduct a second

458
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,830
search where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> property is disabled</font>

459
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:10,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">or turned on or what however you want to</font>

460
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:13,879
express it would locate the possibility

461
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:17,240
of an equivalent match and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

462
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:21,289
suggest hey did you really mean Zurich

463
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the two dots over the you and then</font>

464
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:25,059
the

465
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:27,909
mua can say is this what you really

466
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:30,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">meant user can click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and it can</font>

467
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:34,599
update the email address field or not

468
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:37,210
and to me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost seems like an</font>

469
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:40,200
expression of<font color="#CCCCCC"> uppercase versus lowercase</font>

470
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:42,580
but I'm looking at it very naively and

471
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,259
the more we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about it the more it</font>

472
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,718
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we almost need to involve</font>

473
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:49,450
the folks at the UTC precisely because

474
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:51,129
they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that have stockpiled</font>

475
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,859
all of the people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are intelligent</font>

476
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:55,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these issues with how many</font>

477
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:59,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundreds of different languages that are</font>

478
00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:03,369
represented by Unicode I don't think the

479
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,320
IETF has people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak all of those</font>

480
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:07,299
different languages and understand the

481
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,469
various properties of all those

482
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:15,489
different scripts but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

483
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:17,439
where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came to I guess the only other</font>

484
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:20,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing I'd close out my long-winded</font>

485
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,409
ramble with is by saying that when I'm

486
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:26,799
developing a system I need to be

487
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:29,649
cognizant of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation that me and</font>

488
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:32,469
Pete talked about where some systems may

489
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:37,388
want to allow a situation where you have

490
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:39,308
two users one that spells Erick with the

491
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:42,760
regular you and one with the dots over

492
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:44,200
it and some systems may want to make

493
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,899
those mutually exclusive where you could

494
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,460
have one but not the other you can do

495
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,409
either one but you can't have both

496
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,000
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confusion factor and</font>

497
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:55,149
that's where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security aspect gets</font>

498
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,390
into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was of the opinion that</font>

499
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:01,118
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have both of those</font>

500
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,210
accounts on the same system<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font>

501
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:08,710
a user could type in one variation of

502
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:10,420
that name and end up sending a sensitive

503
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,150
message to a completely different

504
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,309
account which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the desired outcome</font>

505
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,980
from a security perspective Pete was

506
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:21,369
arguing that there are a lot of people

507
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">who would want those to be two distinct</font>

508
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,029
accounts and would get upset if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

509
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,890
couldn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that distinction so it's</font>

510
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">just something to be cognizant of and</font>

511
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,730
how we express this problem needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

512
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

513
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,420
Andrew Sullivan and I will channel

514
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:43,790
myself first and then John when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

515
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,070
high school I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a band and we had</font>

516
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,140
among other things a song called I hate

517
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,240
Motley Crue the lyrics of which were I

518
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,930
hate Motley Crue I hate the dots above

519
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,839
the you and I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lo these</font>

520
00:35:53,930 --> 00:36:02,419
many insider this is gonna be chilly

521
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:04,790
that I'm the Holy anyway on so to my

522
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,280
response to Jim's question do we

523
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:12,200
understand this is essentially giraffe

524
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:15,710
handlebar bicycle no we don't know John

525
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,899
had something a little bit more saying

526
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially depends on what you</font>

527
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,660
mean by we and understand so I think

528
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's fundamentally what the what</font>

529
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:29,060
the work of that we would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

530
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,439
under loose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not why I</font>

531
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,470
got up here though I got up here to

532
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,020
respond to two berries remark which was

533
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:39,049
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nico changes this again stuff</font>

534
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:41,210
could could shift on us again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

535
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,240
we want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very careful here um</font>

536
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:47,330
único didn't actually change anything

537
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:51,140
they had a system that just didn't work

538
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:54,470
the way we thought it did and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

539
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:58,390
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they added a code point under a</font>

540
00:36:54,470 --> 00:37:02,500
set of conventions and principles that

541
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:06,049
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fully grasp now there is</font>

542
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,450
reason to suppose that no English

543
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,390
speaker of sufficient technical

544
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,710
background could have read the

545
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:17,150
definitions in the unicode standard

546
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:19,640
prior to 70 and understand that but it

547
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,040
appears now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in retrospect that there was</font>

548
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,990
a fairly consistent set of principles

549
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,210
going on there and maybe it was just a

550
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:29,839
bug in the in the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written</font>

551
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,130
down finally to channel something else

552
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,310
that John was saying which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

553
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,510
different topic the Zurich case doesn't

554
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,160
involve lucid issue and is very

555
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,830
a fundamental to what is supposed

556
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,720
to be doing so it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

557
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:46,440
quite a different case in particular

558
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,120
normalization<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't help with that</font>

559
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,880
either but it turns into a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky</font>

560
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,740
language sensitive problem and the

561
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,660
language sensitive problem is something

562
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:59,720
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not doing here are</font>

563
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:03,180
not doing in lucid thing clarify in what

564
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:07,230
Andrew just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I i did this is Barry I</font>

565
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:09,240
did not mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> unicode had changed</font>

566
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,210
something or that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was their fault</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

567
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,069
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

568
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,200
future there might be some other aspect

569
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,540
of how they make decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

570
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,990
equally unaware of now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would trip</font>

571
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,759
us up this is pete and i think i'm going

572
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:27,959
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disagree with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> barry on</font>

573
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,720
this one the whole idea of actually

574
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,480
having a communication with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unicode</font>

575
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,080
consortium and getting them to come up

576
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a property that we mutually</font>

577
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,930
understand to be the thing we're working

578
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:44,790
on it's certainly possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we screw</font>

579
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,819
it up again and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand what</font>

580
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:49,650
they mean and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we end up with a new</font>

581
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,930
set of characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something very</font>

582
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,430
different but we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lowered the</font>

583
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,819
odds if this communication goes on

584
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,520
mutually and channel and bearing says

585
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,500
yep yep yep yep yep and and just to

586
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,150
follow up on what John said tuladhar

587
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,120
which i think is an important point the

588
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,160
the what i would call compatibility

589
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,980
matching the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of search stuff really</font>

590
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,020
is sort of independent of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> pracy is</font>

591
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,430
doing and what the lucid problem is

592
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it's certainly something that</font>

593
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,899
needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be dealt with and and we can</font>

594
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,460
have a long discussion about you know

595
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,740
what kinds of things we do for those

596
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,950
sort of fuzzy matching rules which is a

597
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,990
whole big complicated problem and some

598
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,640
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you'll want to solve in in your</font>

599
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:33,589
implementation and something you really

600
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,850
want but play see the the kind of

601
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:38,250
property that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about is</font>

602
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:40,799
strictly if you want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

603
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">purely as identifiers without fuzzy</font>

604
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,150
matching that you want all of the false

605
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,950
positives to go away

606
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,180
and once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fuzzy matching</font>

607
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,368
stuff we've got a whole different

608
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,339
problem so we do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to separate that</font>

609
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:55,200
out we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the property for</font>

610
00:39:52,339 --> 00:40:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier that are not going to be used</font>

611
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:04,680
in fuzzy matching<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stewart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheshire a</font>

612
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:06,390
quick thing comment things that we

613
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,618
should remember I think some of the

614
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,259
people in the room know this but

615
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,470
probably not everybody we need to be

616
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,180
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful not to apply our own</font>

617
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,970
intuition two languages we're going to

618
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:21,210
understand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> luda was saying something</font>

619
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,770
that we all do we assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the oh</font>

620
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,170
with or without the little dots on top

621
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:28,829
is ought to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same letter because</font>

622
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:32,490
to us as<font color="#E5E5E5"> English speakers and like you</font>

623
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:34,730
I'm only fluent in English I can read

624
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,500
and write passable<font color="#CCCCCC"> French and German</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

625
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,829
hindi and gujarati but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know any</font>

626
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:44,039
right to left scripts and I don't know

627
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:46,470
Japanese or Chinese so I've got limited

628
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,180
personal experience and to me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

629
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,220
dots on the letter are just like crumbs

630
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,049
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> page a little bit of dirt I'd</font>

631
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,759
brush them away because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

632
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:57,000
matter but to other people they're

633
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,010
really important and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not make</font>

634
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,869
the mistakes if people in another

635
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:04,289
culture were having this discussion

636
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:07,230
about English and I'll just use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

637
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,539
an analogies they might say that letter

638
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,890
L and the L with a line through it well

639
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,079
they're kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing but</font>

640
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll be the line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tee and</font>

641
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,839
to us to map those as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

642
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,430
identifier would be crazy and polish has

643
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">an L with a line in it except that L is</font>

644
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:27,210
slanted and it's pronounced like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> W and</font>

645
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:29,669
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a tea or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an L so our</font>

646
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,589
intuition that it's obvious that

647
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:34,170
uppercase and lowercase a are the same

648
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:40,140
thing is a very dangerous intuition to

649
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:41,730
carry on to other scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just</font>

650
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,098
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I think you made an</font>

651
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:47,480
important point and it made me<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font>

652
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this problem really is isn't</font>

653
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,559
understanding the specific languages

654
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:55,710
because we have matching<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules that are</font>

655
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:58,020
specific to a script already the problem

656
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:02,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're building systems that cut</font>

657
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:05,520
cross-language and locale boundaries

658
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:07,470
where we've got us users talking to

659
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,570
people in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that speak a completely</font>

660
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:12,899
different language and like you pointed

661
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:16,110
out have their solid Oregon have very

662
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,290
different ideas about what should match

663
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:25,190
and what shouldn't and that's where the

664
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:27,900
problem lies because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. user may not</font>

665
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,540
understand the distinction between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

666
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:35,370
characters that a European user would

667
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:39,600
and how do we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rules that we</font>

668
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:41,250
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply to be as safe as possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

669
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,960
that at least when we get it wrong we

670
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,520
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to the standard and say well</font>

671
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they said we should do</font>

672
00:42:51,590 --> 00:43:08,880
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> said is done right okay I'm not</font>

673
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure there's a clear conclusion but it</font>

674
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:16,860
was a placeholder in case we had a here

675
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,860
you know work item for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> preseason last</font>

676
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:23,330
item I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to is</font>

677
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,330
something that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been has been</font>

678
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:29,970
discussed a bit during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group</font>

679
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:32,370
lunch today was so one of the

680
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:36,770
deliverables of this working group so

681
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:46,350
these are below here let me see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

682
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:50,600
improve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so we've done that</font>

683
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:53,819
we've got that we've done some of those

684
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:57,390
then there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea of guidelines for</font>

685
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:59,490
people to you know help doing profiles

686
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:04,200
or not doing profiles and stuff and that

687
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:06,600
document hasn't been started so are we

688
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're closed the</font>

689
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:14,750
working group or do or wait until

690
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:19,110
further profiles come in or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something so</font>

691
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:21,090
there were some support in the working

692
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:24,960
group chair lunch to get the guidelines

693
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:27,240
for people but that we would require

694
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,430
some people to write the document so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

695
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:38,339
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have anybody to write a</font>

696
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:40,169
document so we're gonna bail yeah do you

697
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,330
do you honestly think this is very do

698
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,950
you honestly think that there's enough

699
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:52,200
energy here to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

700
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:53,939
right this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> SL the floor that's a</font>

701
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,620
possibility though what what Aleksei

702
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,570
just said not unless people come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

703
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,509
help so if you can scare up enough

704
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,450
people to

705
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:03,160
and reactivate things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy to</font>

706
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:08,620
let the working group go in that

707
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,359
direction the on the profiles<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I think</font>

708
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,150
what's more like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

709
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,170
to get profiles coming in tomorrow right

710
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:18,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're probably going to come in a</font>

711
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:20,350
while later if they do so I be more

712
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,530
happy to charter up a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>
