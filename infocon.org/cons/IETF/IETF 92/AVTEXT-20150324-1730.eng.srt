in late

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,660
Perkins yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I both the chairs</font>

50
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:26,480
are also concerned with declarations

51
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:28,250
coming in late I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically ideally</font>

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
and this applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four drafts on</font>

53
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,720
the table at the moment please then

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,670
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss later please do</font>

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,190
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make any declarations you know</font>

56
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,200
of at the time when it stood an author

57
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,060
draft so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see those and</font>

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,679
take them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account when we make the</font>

59
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,330
decision as to whether we're going to

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,269
work on these as i work in group draft

61
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:54,920
it is much easier if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do get it then</font>

62
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:56,569
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than later right stream pause it</font>

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,048
was had one working group last call

65
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,340

call on the stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> pause document or are</font>

67
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,510

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">all was only able only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had the state to</font>

147
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,270
decode some of the layers of a of a

148
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:48,650
layer of a layered included source

149
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,570
possibly done and after

150
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,448
and and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after the refresher</font>

151
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,659
point can decode a greater number of the

152
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,889
layers so next slide I have some

153
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,259
illustrations of this so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

154
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a spatial refresh point it's the</font>

155
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:07,910
ideas so we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two spatial layers</font>

156
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:11,210
which are called s0 and s1 and a decoder

157
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">is currently decoding layer s0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

158
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,719
at frame<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 he can certainly coding a</font>

159
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:20,419
sorry mess one because frame 3 s 1

160
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,940
there's no dependency on previous frames

161
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,400
in that layer it's only it's only

162
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,150
dependency on the lower layer and future

163
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,460
so he can start decoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that without s0</font>

164
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:36,439
stream needing any kind of special

165
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,490
refresh points so as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up the</font>

166
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,039
second presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pick you up</font>

167
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,920
when when this is done so next slide so

168
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,420
then a temporal refresh point similarly

169
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:53,810
is if you have streams which are

170
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:59,839
referencing<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a to hire temporal layer</font>

171
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:01,699
is referencing earlier pictures in the

172
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,540
temporal layer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is valid most</font>

173
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,820
definitions upper layers then<font color="#E5E5E5"> similarly</font>

174
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,079
the point at which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start</font>

175
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,089
decoding the higher temporal layer

176
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,580
without needing earlier friends of that

177
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,380
temporal layer on this picture frame<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

178
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry the type on the slide that should</font>

179
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:22,880
be temporal refresh point copy and paste

180
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,260
for layer t1 and the next slide so this

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of temporal nesting</font>

182
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,730
sometimes temporal refresh points are

183
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:34,640
unnecessary if your layered stream has a

184
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:36,230
temporal structure such that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's</font>

185
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,250
called temporal nesting there's a formal

186
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,860
definition but basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means</font>

187
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,690
is that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need temporal refresh</font>

188
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,430
points because basically every frame the

189
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:48,770
chapel refresh points always<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe safe</font>

190
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:50,449
to switch up so just to say that you

191
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,100
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible that you may never</font>

192
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,500
need this method as and before you're

193
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:58,820
doing temporal only temporal scalability

194
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,620
with certain structures so next slide so

195
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,480
the layer refreshed message is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

196
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,250
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 PF feedback message</font>

197
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,209
for the details are in the draft it's

198
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,500
pretty straightforward a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BPF message so</font>

199
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,479
what you say is you what you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

200
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,240
you basically specify the new layer you

201
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,310
want and optionally the current lowest

202
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,839
layer you're able to decode if you don't

203
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,959
specify that lowest layer it means you

204
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,670
currently can't decode anything how you

205
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe layers and how you identify</font>

206
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:32,060
when you've actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotten the Refresh</font>

207
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:38,360
point is codec dependent but so I mean

208
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:40,550
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got layer definitions and for the</font>

209
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,100
butcher sort of sketchy just quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

210
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,439
dirty for the four codecs we identified

211
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have some form of temporal or</font>

212
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,820
spatial scalability still a lot of

213
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,219
details needed especially how you

214
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,300
recognize where the Refresh points are

215
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,680
because that's because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

216
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,510
identifying layers a straight usually

217
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,519
straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifying refresh</font>

218
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,959
points so you know when you've been

219
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,070
satisfied you can start using the layers

220
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:08,420
often trickier any comments so far by

221
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:13,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way or and then the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide and</font>

222
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:16,969
then for the applicability to the multi

223
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,079
stream modes the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the multi</font>

224
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,329
stream modes is always could you just

225
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,949
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> F IR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send fi are for one of the</font>

226
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,589
streams and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

227
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:26,990
problem i have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no where have we</font>

228
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,470
actually specified what fer means for

229
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,630
any sort of multi stream encoding of a

230
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,010
layered source does it refresh the

231
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,310
individual stream does it repress the

232
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,600
whole source I think there's cases where

233
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,119
would be useful to have refresh the

234
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,709
whole source semantics at which point

235
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that fi are just means refresh</font>

236
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,609
the stream is problematic so what this

237
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,529
draft is proposing is that fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

238
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether regardless of what scalability</font>

239
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,850
your mode you're using fi are means

240
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:58,250
refresh the whole source and use lrr for

241
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,100
the Refresh individual layer or set of

242
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,839
layers let me get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

243
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,100
presentation in n duty<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font>

244
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the last slide other than you</font>

245
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,449
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this ok all right ok can I</font>

246
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">just before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually move into the</font>

247
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,569
questions then ask I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this</font>

248
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">for all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the trials who's actually read</font>

249
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:17,990
this draft so at least a dozen

250
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,329
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> how on that please yeah Ronnie oven</font>

251
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,640
so it this the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> part it relates also</font>

252
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,910
to the previous slide because this

253
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,760
what's F IR means is usually specified

254
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,439
like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea are in the right so</font>

255
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically the oh you expect you'll</font>

256
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,230
expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write as far as I can tell 864</font>

257
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,180
suc which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee wants to publish RFC</font>

258
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,760
didn't say what if I are met for the

259
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-story modes and nothing else is</font>

260
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,319
actually publish arts again so help them

261
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,449
sell just Bernardo but just a general

262
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,570
comment right at least typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

263
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">temporal scalability it doesn't make a</font>

264
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,740
lot of sense to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fi are for an</font>

265
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,380
extension layer right that is certainly

266
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,029
true yes right so in some sense it's

267
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,790
kind of an irrelevant question because

268
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:04,220
you'd send it to the base<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC and that</font>

269
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">would yeah but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in yeah that's there</font>

270
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,149
yeah so it's but the but for but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

271
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,890
most people don't yet people don't tend

272
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do multi stream temporal scalability</font>

273
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,620
as much anyway since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i don't know</font>

274
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,300
i mean you reduce you guys need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

275
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,190
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-stream guys so what how</font>

276
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,290
do you do just everything's actually a

277
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,480
separate stream yeah everything's a

278
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,949
separate stream but the iframe would

279
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,899
only be on the base layer so that would

280
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,910
be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd send the</font>

281
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:30,589
far2 yeah but I you know I I'm not

282
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,300
really in love with redefining how

283
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,430
existing stuff works i mean it's fine if

284
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,079
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a new draft but yeah</font>

285
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,209
lemon<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i guess the main thing is</font>

286
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,099
that i don't actually know how existing

287
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,779
stuff works and if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that f</font>

288
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,360
ir means refresh the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean look</font>

289
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,459
at if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing temporal it's</font>

290
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,980
probably six of one half dozen the other

291
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:53,209
it's for multi multi stream spatial that

292
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:56,360
I get confused did have a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

293
00:13:53,209 --> 00:14:00,529
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question about that so you know in the</font>

294
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,029
diagrams you're showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I wanted</font>

295
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,279
to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what you wanted to</font>

296
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:06,110
have happen did you actually want an eye

297
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,649
dr frame to be sent in response to this

298
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:12,079
thing no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want is for it</font>

299
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,579
should not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eye dr it should be the</font>

300
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,510
whole point is to avoid having an eye dr

301
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:22,399
right the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a frame</font>

302
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,569
select for for temporal turn on turn on

303
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,980
temporal nesting if you weren't

304
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,020
previously doing it you were previously

305
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,150
doing it you're happy or are these

306
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:35,210
messages for spatial

307
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:37,870
only reference the lower level pictures

308
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,350
of this frame don't reference earlier

309
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay pictures of the spatial layer</font>

310
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:48,200
that's that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture on slide</font>

311
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,630
three or four whatever that was running

312
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,040
so there's no assumption about what was

313
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:58,689
the state of the loyal or lower layers

314
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,180
in terms of the decoder whether they are

315
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">available or was it can be like for late</font>

316
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,920
Joyner to DC so the assumptions i mean

317
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,810
if you send a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says I</font>

318
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,729
currently have layer 0 I want level 1

319
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,140
the assumption is you have level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 I</font>

320
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,720
mean that's that's the semantics of the

321
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,069
message it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say send a</font>

322
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,050
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says I want I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

323
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,640
anything and I want level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 at which</font>

324
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">point what I would expect you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get is</font>

325
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,930
it might be an eye dr on the base layer

326
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,120
of frame or at least an<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter encoded</font>

327
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,520
exactly the details of what is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

328
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,560
or isn't allowed is a little fuzzy for

329
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,660
united's codec dependent but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

330
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,859
is that the base layer would have enough

331
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,410
that you could start decoding from there

332
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,640
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher layers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

333
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,370
possibly being received by somebody else

334
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,100
could continue uninterruptedly reference

335
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,990
previous frames without so you wouldn't

336
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,880
get so all the other centers wouldn't

337
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,810
get the full band all the other

338
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,670
receivers wouldn't get the full

339
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:56,000
bandwidth hit of an eye dr hon I common

340
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,579
peg and soap yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm generally</font>

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,690
supportive of this a comment that you

342
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,820
would probably should be clear how it

343
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,030
relates<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the FI our draft if you send</font>

344
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,590
a yeah one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these refresh requests for</font>

345
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,689
the base layer and how that's different

346
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,550
for something on that and if I uh yeah i

347
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,080
mean i think i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think this bunch</font>

348
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,000
of details like that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean exactly</font>

349
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,640
like i said what<font color="#E5E5E5"> fi are for a base layer</font>

350
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,410
especially the multi stream means you

351
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:26,120
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was unclear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I mean so maybe</font>

352
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:27,860
and but but also with a LED rich red LED

353
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,200
refresh for the base layer is equivalent

354
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,640
to an if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say i would say</font>

355
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,020
tis not so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the point being</font>

356
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,720
that the higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> lit the layers you're</font>

357
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,430
not talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> continued</font>

358
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,050
uninterruptedly will need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch more</font>

359
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,239
pictures and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like doing</font>

360
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,910
that much ascii art

361
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,560
and I thought it unfortunate that you

362
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,930
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a codec specific</font>

363
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,339
refreshes but I suppose I suspect that's

364
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,310
probably unavoidable<font color="#CCCCCC"> finding the MIT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

365
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:55,079
main thing is how how<font color="#CCCCCC"> codecs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taught you</font>

366
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,109
know talk about layers in terms like how

367
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,069
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what how many dimensions</font>

368
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,100
they have and how many bits each

369
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:04,109
dimension has is it probably is critic

370
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,860
specific it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's basically</font>

371
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,329
because you know 264 SPC has quality

372
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,559
layers which nobody else has how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

373
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:16,339
bits each layer takes is dependent and

374
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,349
so this d-bots go<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh so the message</font>

375
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:23,099
tells the sender to create a refresh

376
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:25,708
point yeah is there any thing we need to

377
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">specify on how the receiver knows when</font>

378
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,370
it's received that<font color="#CCCCCC"> reshef point yes and</font>

379
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,059
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently have text in there for vp9</font>

380
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,799
because that's the one we're actually

381
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,889
working on when we realize this is a

382
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,900
good idea it will that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also need to</font>

383
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,179
be codec specific just<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognizing when</font>

384
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,380
you have an eye DRS codec specific so

385
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:49,200
yeah so we're okay so the draft i

386
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,880
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sections for for you know</font>

387
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the four codecs I've identified</font>

388
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have scalability that people</font>

389
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,178
care about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean how that's recognized</font>

390
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,530
does need to be cut a specific yeah and

391
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,570
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's actually the</font>

392
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,149
harder part because you know the details

393
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of exactly what our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't allowed I can</font>

394
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,909
have a lot of subtleties in terms of

395
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,080
like what is or isn't allowed as a

396
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,929
reference frame and things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

397
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,240
yeah it's all detectable by examining

398
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:14,309
the RTP stream yeah exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

399
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,780
possible we'll discover that oh no wait

400
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,030
this codec you can't actually detect it

401
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,250
so we're going to not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not allow</font>

402
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kodak but we're hoping that I</font>

403
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,140
mean certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anything that's not</font>

404
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,070
yet a published RFC or in public

405
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully we can figure out how to</font>

406
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,840
identify this for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fool arguably</font>

407
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,820
you could so you put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the pilot</font>

408
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,620
definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you good yeah so I mean I</font>

409
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,750
think for well prefer things that are

410
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,979
currently I mean where it is

411
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,750
documentation wise whether it's in the

412
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,980
payload type documentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and for</font>

413
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,780
anything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future would clearly be</font>

414
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">analytic definition for anything that's</font>

415
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,020
already published RFC will be in this

416
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,789
document things that are currently in

417
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,889
progress it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on where they are in</font>

418
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,390
the cycle arguably right if you send

419
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,480
this command and you display what you're

420
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,640
receiving anyway

421
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,200
in a short amount of time the picture

422
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,620
will clear up right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's conceivable</font>

423
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,570
that even at the codec if you don't know

424
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to specify how it's detected it</font>

425
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,659
might still actually work I mean yeah I

426
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,850
mean just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might get life</font>

427
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,650
iframes decided if I are but I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

428
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,240
mean is there's a lot of ugly stuff that

429
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,950
happens on video switches and everyone

430
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,600
just hopes it clears up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it right yeah</font>

431
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,130

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,600
will confirm all these on the list is

445
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,080
it's easier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to see but basically</font>

446
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,429
show your hands of you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think this</font>

actually supporting the work just to

453
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:06,220
give it some prioritization so first of

454
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:11,709
all those interested in or think ITF

455
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:13,150
should be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dozen those</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this work it consensus and just now for</font>

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,500
our information who would be interested

459
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,840
in actually reviewing and supporting

471
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,860
derived from some parallel work

happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a VT core well actually now</font>

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,550
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be probably new working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

474
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are some security architectures</font>

475
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,169
that are being proposed where the

476
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,060
traditional middleboxes will not have

477
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,990
access to media keys and so the payload

478
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:39,409
will potentially not be visible to those

479
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,960
middleboxes that do the actual media

480
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,800
switching and in those<font color="#E5E5E5"> into end private</font>

481
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,590
media architectures we need some some

482
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,990
more critical metadata available at the

483
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:54,409
switch in order to make forwarding

484
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,150
decisions possible so the the goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

485
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,760
this work is to have an agnostic

486
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,830
switching so these middleboxes never

487
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,150
ever have to inspect the payload and

488
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,250
they can still perform all their

489
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,360
forwarding functions again mainly

490
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,880
because the payload may be encrypted

491
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,949
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing in private</font>

492
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,570
media if the payload is encrypted you

493
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,730
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid the cost of doing the</font>

494
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,909
decryption in the middle box for higher

495
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,130
scale but most importantly is the middle

496
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,920
bullet in these Indian architectures

497
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,920
it's simply impossible to do any kind of

498
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,510
payload inspection and that that

499
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,830
seriously hampers some of the forwarding

500
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,620
functions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do in the</font>

501
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,050
switch and so we need something beyond

502
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,260
the current RTP headers to make those

503
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:38,629
decisions and then also a more

504
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,160
forward-looking goal is to have the

505
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,070
switching function be something that's

506
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,870
codec agnostic a truly capable of

507
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">handling any codec format potentially</font>

508
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,610
even not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even knowing what the codec</font>

509
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,770
format is as long as it knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

510
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,050
format is conforming to these to these

511
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,070
metadata markings it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even need</font>

512
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,809
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the what the underlying</font>

513
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:02,649
codec is next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

514
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:05,710
and so the the intelligence in the

515
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:07,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch can help to provide cleaner video</font>

516
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,360
switching typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> when these switches</font>

517
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:12,940
operate they're usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an active</font>

518
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,809
speaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> role so that when the active</font>

519
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:21,519
speaker is talking using the voice

520
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:23,830
activity level arti beta extensions when

521
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,659
the active speaker is talking their

522
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,049
video will be switched in and if you do

523
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:30,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">that naively you won't get it at a clean</font>

524
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">iframe boundary and so there may be a</font>

525
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:36,669
glitch during speaker switching so we

526
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,289
need some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of indicator so that the</font>

527
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,440
switch knows when it's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver a</font>

528
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:43,029
full clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> intra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frame you'll also be</font>

529
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,679
able to have better recovery during

530
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:47,320
packet losses because today when the

531
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,330
switches detect some packet losses they

532
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,740
don't have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about the</font>

533
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,149
context of that packet loss that it

534
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,440
affect an entire frame that it affect

535
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:55,090
leading loss of the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

536
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,480
frame trailing loss at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

537
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,939
frame so being able to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

538
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,999
data about exactly the extent of the

539
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,429
loss helps the recovery operations and

540
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,690
during congestion the switch can make

541
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,730
more intelligent decisions about what to

542
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,889
drop if there's information about the

543
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,690
priority of the packets in that media

544
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:16,869
flow the switch can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

545
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,970
decisions that affect less participants

546
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:21,059
and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have diversity</font>

547
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,879
in the capabilities of the participants

548
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,340
you can drop entire layers towards some

549
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:29,529
of them and the setter extension will

550
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,809
allow that and for the endpoints there's

551
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,629
also a small side benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being able</font>

552
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:36,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have better recovery same as in the</font>

553
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:37,240
sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the switch would have you can</font>

554
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,539
better identify leading and trailing

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,570
loss scenarios to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when you have</font>

full media frames next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please yes</font>

557
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,408
the proposed solution is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RTP header</font>

558
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,740
extension and it's split into two parts

559
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:51,970
there's a mandatory fixed length codec

560
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,299
independent part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what really</font>

561
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:58,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to focus on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today there's also an</font>

562
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:00,610
optional variable length<font color="#E5E5E5"> part that's</font>

563
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:03,850
codec specific and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defined</font>

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,850
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each payload format we're initially</font>

565
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,779
proposing to define the popular paler

566
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,238
formats in this in this draft

567
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,700
and specify what that optional extension

568
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:15,960
looks like for those formats new formats

569
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,109
going forward in payload would be

570
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,229
encouraged to to define what this blob

571
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:25,918
means for those formats and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

572
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:28,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard header extension model from</font>

573
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,039
fifty to eighty five so the the length

574
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,359
that's encoded in that standard tells

575
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,340
you whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not there is an optional</font>

576
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,830
part present and if its present how big

577
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,119
it is and of course it'll be negotiated

here to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> more general but</font>

about next slide please quick question

so we were the discardable bit be said

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:11,489
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that redundant with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the temple</font>

612
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:17,129
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means that truly</font>

discardable in the sense that it would

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,479
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some codex make a distinction</font>

to signal it and we could explore

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,050
whether or not that's something useful

00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,290
there's there's no desire to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's outside the scope of what we want</font>

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,030
to do today which is decide what did you

643
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,740
do to work or not so quickly going

644
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,700
through the rationale<font color="#CCCCCC"> first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

645
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,530

646
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,580
intuitively may think why on earth would

647
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,410
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> into frame you've got the</font>

648
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,290
marker bit all the markers very poorly

649
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,420
defined it's not reliable nobody can

650
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,180
really use it effectively so we

651
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,490
definitely need into frame and the way

652
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the markers currently defined it's</font>

653
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,640
actually different depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

654
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,600
standard you're looking at when it comes

655
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,770
to scalable media and we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much</font>

656
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,929
more much more sane and robust

657
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,210
definition is just to have it indicate

658
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,390
end of in the frame for that particular

659
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:08,340
layer so for each layer you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you can</font>

660
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this this indicator set and then</font>

661
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,899
start a frame is useful to know whether

662
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,610
or not in Los scenarios whether you

663
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,810
actually have the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the frame</font>

664
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not because you can't discern when</font>

665
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,260
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss whether it was you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

668

669
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,720
you can look at the payload and inspect

670
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,520
usually it's pretty simple within most

671
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,320
codec formats to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the first few</font>

672
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,730
bites and determine whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

679
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,459
what you're saying is the current usage

680

the last packet to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the frame and that's</font>

684
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,260
how we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the saying much well the</font>

layer not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Valeri level but also not not</font>

686
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:05,060
normally it says you must not rely

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:14,449
decoders must not rely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so here</font>

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:16,190
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about relying on it we so</font>

695
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,880
I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if like to just make sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into this expansion well the goal of</font>

699
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,690
this is to is to abstract out what's

700
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,520
common among all the payload formats and

701
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,050
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical for media switching</font>

702
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:47,420
what's a critical function for middle

704

705
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,070
the answer is definitely no you don't

706
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,730
want all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crap that's in there in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this extension it would be worthwhile i</font>

708
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,960
think as part of this exercise to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go off</font>

709
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example stuff like vp8 which is and</font>

why you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or don't in the rest of</font>

that would things like the key idx i

713

would i would personally argue that

714

certain fields are needed that are

716
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,150

please for independent we've already

721
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,550
covered it it's to allow clean video

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,610
that to drop packets whenever whenever

if you're if you're not in scalable

729
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,290
media this would would always be zeros

730
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:50,290
so it would be used but if you have

whether this is the right solution was

in a header extension that's basically

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm interested in now John Lomax is</font>

767
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,760

768
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,350
feels pretty solid for temporal

769
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,960
scalability it feels a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little under</font>

770
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,459
baked for spatial we can talk about

771
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,470
that's about flying about but I feel

772
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I don't have a clear notion of how</font>

773
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,560
I would how does whether this would do

774
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,290
everything I need for spatial whereas

775
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,810
for temporal it feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> very solid I agree</font>

776
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:50,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's mostly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

777
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,970
abstracted out the codec codec agnostic

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,800
part of special skill<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he could</font>

779
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly be extracted out but it's a</font>

780
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more nuanced temporal scalability</font>

781
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,870
is uniform across the board the only

782
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,100
difference is vp8 is to bits everybody

783
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,168
else's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three that's the only different</font>

784
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,490
so give three bits n 57 spatial and

785
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:05,679
quality skillet<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more confusing</font>

786
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,120
because in 264 you have seven bits and

787
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,030
they're partitioned hard into three and

788
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,819
four and 265 it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

789
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,970
partition at six bits so there's it's

790
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:19,030
harder to get uniformity on that aspect

791
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,560
and I think it's less used so let's bang

792
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:24,669
for the buck when you look at these

793
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,139
switching operations yeah so I more or

794
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:28,449
less agree with Jonathan that the

795
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:30,399
temporal stuff is well understood I

796
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,290
think to get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down into this</font>

797
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,819
you have to go over a lot of specifics

798
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,489
about how implementations really work

799
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,619
what they use what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use but</font>

800
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,138
you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good start and there's</font>

801
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:42,609
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim it's done yet so will I kind of</font>

802
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:44,320
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion probably go</font>

803
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:46,389
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the in and outs of various</font>

804
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,669
codecs and what is used and what isn't

805
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:50,740
and also frankly what feedback messages

806
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,000
are used in what aren't but would you

807
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:54,668
prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that as a working group</font>

808
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,260
document or an auto document would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

809
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefer to that discussion took place</font>

810
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,950
while it was still an auto document or

811
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,750
would you like looking into a bucket

812
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the knowledge that you know we'll</font>

813
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,930
have to hash that out like anything else

814
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:12,369
I'd agree its darkness cut by the way

815
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:14,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right city</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pottsville again I</font>

816
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,850
agree it's a good start I'm not real

817
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,799
keen on the codec specific information

818
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,118
field I do see a connection here with

819
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,310
Jonathan strap because you could also

820
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,640
have a refresher point it here if you

821
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:31,330
add another bit I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:35,799
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> working good bottom hi I'm Colin</font>

823
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:39,460
Perkins um I agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're going</font>

824
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of private cloud</font>

825
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:47,200
switching stuff then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need something</font>

826
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:53,770
to solve this problem and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

827
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">is one reasonable way of solving that it</font>

828
00:35:53,770 --> 00:36:00,340
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some of the discussion</font>

829
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,830
regarding the switching stuff may

830
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:07,210
involve changes to srtp

831
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:11,140
if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens then exposing some of</font>

832
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:12,820
the payload headers in an encrypted form

833
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,770
would be an alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of solving</font>

834
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:18,640
that which would perhaps be lower

835
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:21,730
overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I don't know how that</font>

836
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,350
discussion is going to pan out but it

837
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,690
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should perhaps have some</font>

838
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,779
of that discussion before making a

839
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,760
that's a possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I took that's a</font>

840
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,790
possibility but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors would</font>

841
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,640
explicitly like to go in at payload

842
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:38,259
agnostic forwarding direction so even if

843
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,129
it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the prime market even if</font>

844
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,190
it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the private media</font>

845
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,630
architectures I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a more</font>

846
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,210
fundamental goal of this work to make

847
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,720
the RTP forwarding function independent

848
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:52,630
of the of the payload format and so

849
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:57,220
extracting codec specific payloads for

850
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:59,350
the private media work seems like it's

851
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,330
possible solution but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like it's</font>

852
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:03,310
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution that that gets us going</font>

853
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,650
forward with new codex but if the gold

854
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">mines not I'm afraid but if the goal is</font>

855
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,640
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be codec agnostic then I would be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I think there's a bit scope for a bit</font>

861
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,450
more discussion on the list on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

862
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,160
actual scope but I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

863
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,189
viewpoint and what the support<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the</font>

864
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">room for doing the work so same</font>

865
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,600
questions as last time those you think

866
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,240
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I TF should be</font>

867
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,560
working on versus those who do not and

868
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,930
then I'll ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for interest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in supporting</font>

869
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,549
the work but I do expect to see some

870
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:43,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">more discussion on the list on scoping</font>

871
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:45,310
so those interested in think those who

872
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:51,820
think IETF should be doing the work put

873
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:53,799
your hand up now please 12 15 16 17<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

874
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,310
those who do not think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ETF ship doing</font>

875
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this work those who will be interested</font>

876
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:04,710
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting the work by reviewing and</font>

877
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:04,710
so on 12

878
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,780
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> compact I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a slightly</font>

879
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,880
broader question i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the ATF should</font>

880
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,160
be doing some working in this area I'm

881
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,580
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred percent convinced this is</font>

882
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,290
the right answer yeah so I think what

883
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,940
I'm expecting you to do colonies post

884
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,200
that to the list with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Santa sort of</font>

885
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,320
initiate the discussion is that

886
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,819
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do I mean basically</font>

887
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what I want to see on the list is</font>

888
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,130
what is now the real scope of what we're

889
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:37,420
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and and so on what are the</font>

890
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,440
constraints on that scope so we can

891
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually know what to write in the</font>

892
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,369
milestone real quickly um I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked</font>

893
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:49,089
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in real time I think we</font>

894
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:51,550
do has IPR on this stuff so I don't know

895
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,920
whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reopen the voting</font>

896
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,050
based on this information I will verify

897
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,330
that and I'm going to verify all these

898
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,060
on the earth with our usual terms yeah

899
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:02,529
so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could consult with I don't</font>

900
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,880
do this type of stuff in real time I

901
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,619
have to draft up now having<font color="#CCCCCC"> made sure</font>

902
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,150
they can tonight maybe you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

903
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:07,930
talk to Jonathan and see what what you

904
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,580
know whether there's something that

905
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't be made as a sale will be</font>

906
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,200
reconfirming these on the list anyway so

907
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm for next to me that picture</font>

908
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,300
verification

909
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:48,710
that's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that last</font>

910
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:50,240
one did I hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you plan to ask for</font>

911
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,710
a milestone for it but you need to work

912
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,959
on the scope or that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

913
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:57,049
work on the scope and then decide on the

914
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,490
milestone the first I think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

915
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what the scope is before I decide</font>

916
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:03,140
on the milestone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the second yeah so</font>

917
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,180
there's a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more discussion Allah list</font>

918
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,710
what I'm seeing is broadly people in the

919
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,750
room want to do some work in this area

920
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:19,910
right we now need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out exactly</font>

921
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:29,779
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so is presenting us from see</font>

922
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:33,069
here do you want to present it what

923
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:33,069
happened to full screen in this one

924
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:43,250
control so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Bob Berman</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm be</font>

925
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,839
presenting this about reference picture

926
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:49,250
verification information that is again

927
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:53,049
things that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle specific</font>

928
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:59,329
codec so next please there is IP are

929
00:40:53,049 --> 00:41:01,759
multiple on this one next please so the

930
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,240
motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that with modern</font>

931
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:07,160
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> codecs you often have multiple</font>

932
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,758
reference pictures like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use for</font>

933
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:13,190
for improved compression and you can

934
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:16,880
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover from decoding</font>

935
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:20,779
errors and packet losses for example the

936
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,349
hevc codec has also a possibility to

937
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:26,119
include a decoded picture hash

938
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:27,829
information to really verify that you

939
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,579
decoded the frame correctly which is

940
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:35,869
usually left out since previous codex

941
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:40,460
it's not a per pixel exactness measure

942
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:44,420
but here you have that and this message

943
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:48,079
is introduced to enable the use of these

944
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,779
features having a controlled way of

945
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,880
referencing pictures that may be lost

946
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:54,380
and also checking that the correctness

947
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:02,090
of the decoding

948
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:05,180
so next please we propose to use an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTC</font>

949
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">p feedback message to enable the</font>

950
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,470
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information from</font>

951
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:12,259
the decoder to the encoder you can

952
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:16,040
indicate multiple decoded pictures that

953
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,570
are to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reference or indicate</font>

954
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,529
that a specific picture was not

955
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:23,090
decodable maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of loss you can</font>

956
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,150
indicate also that a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture</font>

957
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,010
was decoded but with an incorrect result

958
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:32,000
and thus should not be used for

959
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:35,470
reference and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can also explicitly</font>

960
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,230
include the this decoded picture hash

961
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:46,009
for the encoder to evaluate whether this

962
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:47,630
was correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not next please there is</font>

963
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,990
some relation to existing feedback

964
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:56,330
messages the most obvious one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rps</font>

965
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:58,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">I and or if say RFC 4585 the AV PF but</font>

966
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,590
there you only have the possibility to

967
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:06,490
indicate a single picture not met not

968
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:10,670
multiple that one or a vpf also has the

969
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:15,680
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss indication but there you</font>

970
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:18,140
only have the possibility to indicate

971
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,379
that pictures are lost but not which and

972
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:25,040
specifically not which of of certain

973
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,230
reference pictures and there is no

974
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:34,360
mechanism to indicate the incorrect

975
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:34,360
decoding result so next please

976
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,770
that is very short presentation so let's

977
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,830
see if we can get the discussion equally

978
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:45,830
precise concise<font color="#E5E5E5"> um who's read the draft</font>

979
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,450
anybody want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to whether this is</font>

980
00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:01,259
the right solution I had an extension

981
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:03,240
this is anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else all sorry feedback</font>

982
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,570
messages again I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right soon</font>

983
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,060
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this terminology and burn our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wellnes</font>

984
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:11,910
microscope Pam and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font>

985
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,830
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about relevance you know</font>

986
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,480
having done a little bit of asking

987
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,279
around it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out that our psi is</font>

988
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,740
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> not used in conferencing</font>

989
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,670
scenarios and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering here if</font>

990
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,500
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this more as a</font>

991
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:26,880
person-to-person kind of a thing or a

992
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:31,680
conferencing thing yep that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

993
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,660
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interactive scenario yes-mo</font>

994
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">zanetti and the direction that we've</font>

995
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,830
looked at for especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

996
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:40,140
conferencing is more about exposing our

997
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">TP level data instead of codec level</font>

998
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:46,549
data so things where you surface codec

999
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:48,950
level frame<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids and codec level</font>

1000
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:52,080

1001
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:55,020
we've some implementations have gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction to only focus on RTP</font>

those and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the congestion</font>

1005
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,150
work that's being done this very likely

1006
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,750
that we'll have actors and things like

1007
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,920
that for four reasons you know mostly

1008
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,380
related to congestion control but could

1009
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,650
also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know for recovery</font>

1010
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,060
and repair and resilience so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1011
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:18,270
inclined to think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better direction is</font>

1012
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:23,279
to go towards RTP level repair rather

1013
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:26,369
than deep codec level surfacing of those

1014
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,990
those codec specific values up to up to

1015
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:30,830
some other up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some other feedback</font>

1016
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,830
messages or headers

1017
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:37,910
Cullen Jenks I'm just given how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much we</font>

1018
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,710
we've had feedback messages of various

1019
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,810
types over the years and that there's

1020
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,850
not all that much optimization of

1021
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,860
combining them together in the same way

1022
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:49,069
I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd prefer to see us pursue</font>

1023
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,750
something like this that it wasn't as

1024
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,520
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP are encumbered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if</font>

1025
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,140
we could find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Realty free sort of</font>

1026
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:58,240
version of it seems like an area<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1027
00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:01,310
we easily could so this being do<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1028
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">what was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what in echoing mo or were</font>

1029

you actually saying do something

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm suggesting the working</font>

1033
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:17,450
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can stoop icicle another</font>

1034
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,880
question I have is really in order to

1035
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:21,529
actually use this at the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1036
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,450
information has to get there very very

1037
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:28,580
quickly in some scalable scenarios maybe

1038
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,560
quickly is longer than if it's not

1039
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,270
scalable but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

1040
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,890
reasons messages like this haven't been

1041
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,450
adopted in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past is that by the time</font>

1042
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,450
the message gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the encoder the</font>

1043
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:44,779
encoder has no real good way to repair a

1044
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:46,759
frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was lost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten frames ago the</font>

1045
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,310
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem would be there with with</font>

1046
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">RTP specific information like vectors</font>

1047
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:58,029
and such but I wasn't arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in favor</font>

1048
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:58,029
not been just noted

1049
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">minus with them so I think I mean one</font>

1050
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:07,729
reason it might works more these days

1051
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,619
pretty more modern codec is that they

1052
00:47:07,729 --> 00:47:11,868
have bigger frame buffers and more depth

1053
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:14,299
and actually can look started back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1054
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:16,849
history so you actually have still have

1055
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:18,709
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> old reference pictures in the</font>

1056
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:20,209
buffers so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually reach back</font>

1057
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:22,489
and use them when you're repairing

1058
00:47:20,209 --> 00:47:29,299
rather than having to do an eye dr to

1059
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:30,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">repaired applause there's theoretical</font>

1060
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:36,859
and what you can actually do if you're

1061
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:38,299
using third-party encoder hard work so

1062
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:39,558
the chairs here is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of debating</font>

1063
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:42,559
whether we actually put the call now or

1064
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:44,420
not yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it would be useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1065
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,849
find out what do we people think we have

1066
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,380
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be solved but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1067
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:53,479
think that's possibly as far as we might

1068
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:55,249
go now might mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a clearer</font>

1069
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:57,410
definition of what the problem is that

1070
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:59,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this solution songs because i don't</font>

1071
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:01,519
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't feel</font>

1072
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this draft at least turned out the</font>

1073
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,589
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't recall the draft</font>

1074
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:08,059
should have explained you know what the

1075
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:10,249
use case or models was where this would

1076
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:12,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a useful thing to do yeah the</font>

1077
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:15,078
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> side was not clear enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1078
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:16,879
mean like all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking</font>

1079
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:21,559
about like you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> round trip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1080
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,929
issues and I mean you know it is it just

1081
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:25,579
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know HEVC has this feature so</font>

1082
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:27,170
therefore we want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I mean what</font>

1083
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:29,929
what is the scenario in which this would

1084
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,729
be you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the network</font>

1085
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:33,769
topology what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

1086
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:36,229
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no why does it be the best useful</font>

1087
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:37,428
thing to do Bernardo Mike's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1088
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:39,109
general comment though I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1089
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:41,150
important to take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1090
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:43,069
comment of that mo made and kind of

1091
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,559
what's behind it we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an</font>

1092
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:48,199
explosion in video codecs this interest

1093
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,449
in privacy all that tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead to</font>

1094
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:52,279
away from solutions that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1095
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:54,650
specific to certain codecs and are

1096
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:57,739
incompatible with privacy right if we're

1097
00:48:54,650 --> 00:49:00,769
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a dolla and vp9 and v10</font>

1098
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:02,839
and h.265 and whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1099
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:04,848
have a zillion specific messages that

1100
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,078
only work with one specific codec right

1101
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,059
nobody's going to want to implement that

1102
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,039
stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the general</font>

1103
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:11,719
context here and maybe that's explains

1104
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:12,500
the lack of enthusiasm it certainly does

1105
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:14,240
on my part

1106
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,590
you know especially when I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1107
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,879
the feedback messages we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1108
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,480
discovered that like half of them aren't

1109
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,800
used by anybody anymore you know so

1110
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:25,730
inventing yet more stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

1111
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,530
legacy it's not real happy well let me

1112
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:31,340
just comment on that this is definitely

1113
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:43,580
not intended to be codec specific it can

1114
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:45,530
very well be used codec agnostic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee so</font>

1115
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:48,140
what we do is we'll do a quick call to

1116
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:52,730
see between<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are this interesting</font>

1117
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:54,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on this now this is do we taking</font>

1118
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:57,110
another round of discussion as an author

1119
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:02,420
draft and see where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

1120
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:04,310
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so basically yes we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

1121
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,890
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group item now we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1122
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:08,779
get working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it vs. I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1123
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,850
some more discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this take it to</font>

1124
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and see where we go for it from</font>

1125
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:15,380
there so first option who wants to

1126
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually start working on it now they</font>

1127
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is the right thing to do it</font>

1128
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,930
thinks it needs another<font color="#E5E5E5"> round of</font>

1129
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:26,390
discussion to decide what we should be

1130
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:32,930
doing in working group who wants it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1131
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:35,870
go away completely right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1132
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,250
basically progresses an auto draft see

1133
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,569
where you want to go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's a</font>

1134
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,800
discussion with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them some other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1135
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:45,340
maybe persuade them round<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so</font>

1136
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,340
Peter

1137
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:06,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i'm proposing a header extension</font>

1138
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:08,480
that's like the mi da door extension but

1139
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:13,430
for multiple layers instead of multiple

1140
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,349
media sources next slide so we have

1141
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,359
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things or three</font>

1142
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:19,880
different layers within our taxonomy we

1143
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,519
have media sources we have encoded

1144
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,990
streams or<font color="#CCCCCC"> dependants dreams or in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1145
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:25,819
words different layers within a media

1146
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,240
source and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different RTP</font>

1147
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:30,740
streams so media source can have n

1148
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,720
layers or encoded streams and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependents</font>

1149
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:36,470
dreams each one of those can have one

1151
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:40,578
and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could always use payload</font>

1152
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,960
type for all of them but payload type

1153
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:44,690
has problems in the sense that you can

1154
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,849
run out or you could as<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC for</font>

1155
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:50,150
everything but as the sources have their

1156
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:53,930
own issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we defined the midd</font>

1157
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:56,869
extension for the class on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top row</font>

1158
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:58,399
which is media sources and now if we're

1159
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:00,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">not doing any simulcasts or any layering</font>

1160
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,789
you can just use<font color="#E5E5E5"> em ID and payload type</font>

1161
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:03,470
you don't have to sit unless it's our

1162
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:05,569
seas and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about</font>

1163
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:07,970
running out of payload types but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1164
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:13,130
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing simulcast or you're doing</font>

1165
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:16,999
layered encoding there's a missing box

1166
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:19,130
there hi Ann Perkins I'm kind of

1167
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:22,189
confused because you can't use payload

1168
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:25,069
type to half of these things why not

1169
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:27,440
well I mean media sources identified by

1170
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:29,569
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC the RTP stream is identified by</font>

1171
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,920
the SSRC if you're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payload</font>

1172
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:32,920
type to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it wrong</font>

1173
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:41,420
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not how r TP works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font>

1174
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:44,299
well halo-halo type has before have been

1175
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:48,680
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> max and identify all three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1176
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:50,029
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and so has SSRC so no no</font>

1177
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not suggesting this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea</font>

1178
00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:54,259
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting the opposite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1179
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:57,558
So mi Dee was a mi Diah is a good

1180
00:52:54,259 --> 00:52:59,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution so that this is not true what</font>

1181
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,430
is being used is the SSRC is being used

1182
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:02,809
to demultiplex the streams and the

1183
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:06,249
payload type is then being used to

1184
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:06,249
identify what type of meteor it is

1185
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's a fine distinction but</font>

1186
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,280
it's a very fundamental distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1187
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:16,950
how r TP works because the SSRC

1188
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,900
identifies the source the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequence</font>

1189
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:21,000
number space by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload type space</font>

1190
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,210
so that what I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out here</font>

1191
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,160
is that we have a solution with em ID

1192
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,540
for making it so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to signal</font>

1193
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,460
their sister sees and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

1194
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,770
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> payload type being a deluxe</font>

1195
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,210
point that identifies everything and

1196
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:38,880
having the potential for running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1197
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:42,030
payload types I realize it's a bundle I

1198
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:45,900
just believe the slightest incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1199
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">right well you know send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me an email</font>

1200
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,510
with some details of how i can fix this

1201
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:57,630
item sorry if it's slightly incorrect

1202
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:59,190
take the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i left the matter</font>

1203
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,900
the original slide and someone said tell

1204
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:03,150
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some so i think gorgeous</font>

1205
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">tractor what colin is saying yeah in the</font>

1206
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:08,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">RTP level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team oxidation sslc I</font>

1207
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:13,670
think what Peter is saying is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1208
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:16,799
mapped the stream to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is done through</font>

1209
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,330
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particularly this is kind of</font>

1210
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,380
immaterial to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm headed for Texas</font>

1211
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:25,950
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we are heading play my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d it</font>

1212
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,200
like it's kind of a mess and it might be

1213
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">cleaned up a lot of ms 4 bundle where we</font>

1214
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,290
have multiple media sources over the

1215
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,020
same network port but now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

1216
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:35,700
same problem for multiple layers within

1217
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,640
the same media source and so there's

1218
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:42,029
kind of a missing thing for the box so

1219
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,009
what I'm proposing is next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide now we</font>

1220
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:48,060
fill in the box with a header extension

1221
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:50,160
that identifies the layer and you know

1222
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,750
honestly this could potentially be part

1223
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,060
of this other header extension where we

1224
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:56,820
have a temporal ID but instead we put in

1225
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,759
a spatial ID but they didn't have a

1226
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,080
spatial later ID in theirs so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1227
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,100
don't have anything anywhere else I'm

1228
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,860
proposing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have a header</font>

1229
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,020
extension where we can specify an ID

1230
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,510
that indicates the layer the spatial

1231
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,790
layer and that could be called an

1232
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:15,060
encoded string or it could also be for a

1233
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:17,150
dependent stream I chose to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esad</font>

1234
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,360
but like I pointed out here it could be

1235
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:23,860
li d 4 layer ID or

1236
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:27,280
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing so if you can go to the</font>

1237
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:29,020
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide the benefit is you don't need</font>

1238
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,400

1240
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,720
the same problems that we overcame with

1241
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:38,950
mi d<font color="#E5E5E5"> X epilators and this could work in</font>

1242
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,410
conjunction with them work that's going

1243
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:44,290
on a new music where they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1244
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:46,779
define how to do simulcast an<font color="#CCCCCC"> stp by</font>

1247
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:55,509
problem so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is wisdom I think you</font>

1248
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">start in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong group I think you</font>

1250
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:03,400
scarce what type of configuration

00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:06,580
identifier set cetera<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that part</font>

1252
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,410
of the of this work is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1253
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,569
relevant I mean putting in a header

1254
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,670
extension against England which is

1255
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,780
basically whatever text is scope for

1256
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:18,880
doing it is trivial<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's it what's the</font>

1257
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,010
big question here is can is ID be

1258
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,290
singled in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> indie stp in a reasonable</font>

1259
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:26,320
way to actually mean which is resting it

1260
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:29,680
to me and I mean I I want some solution

1261
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,930
for simulcasting identify the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1262
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,879
the configuration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the encoded stream</font>

1263
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,520
and payload type isn't enough from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1264
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,170
perspective so yes I in that sense I

1265
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,120
support the work but I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1266
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:43,210
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and draw the saying how</font>

1267
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:45,700
does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> look in stp rather than being</font>

1268
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:47,320
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussing itself right so</font>

1269
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,419
they're in there to impart line there by

1270
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,490
the way no<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in line after coming</font>

1271
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,380
there are two parts of the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1272
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">other one is to define the header</font>

1273
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,890
extension which you point out is fairly

1274
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,840
trivial in fact i just copied the text

1275
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,940
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mi da door extension and rename</font>

1276
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,010
some things and that was that part of it

1277
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:06,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually think that part of it is</font>

1280
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,810

1281
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:14,380
header extension outside of the realm of

<font color="#E5E5E5">stp which is still valuable the second</font>

1283
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,580
half is how do we map at<font color="#CCCCCC"> stp for those</font>

1284
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:20,500
you want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> STP and how do how do we</font>

1285
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,350
define that so the second half of the of

1286
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,330
the draft is defining a proposal for

1287
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,770
that but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in the sense that</font>

1288

this might not be the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1290
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,720
the header extension here and then the

1293
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:39,580
incorporated into one of their drafts

1294
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:42,310
for the work on simulcast with n<font color="#E5E5E5"> stp so</font>

00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:46,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that that half might</font>

not be right for this group any illegal

1297
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,279
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very good thing I</font>

1298
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:56,830
very much support this work and we have

1299
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,690
that problem today and and I think

1300
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:00,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's very reasonable solution now as</font>

1304
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:11,410
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see why we have to block the</font>

if you can try be as brief as possible

1323

please as well I'm Colin Perkins I have

1324

no<font color="#CCCCCC"> objection to defining identifiers to</font>

1325
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,430
correlate to different streams I think

00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is generally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea I have</font>

1327
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:08,529
strong objections to the way this this

particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft works I think the way</font>

1329
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:13,300
it overloads the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp format parameter is</font>

1330
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:17,170
completely and<font color="#E5E5E5"> utterly broken I think</font>

1331
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:19,900
the way it attempts to extend pelo types

1332
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,490
is completely and<font color="#E5E5E5"> utterly broken so I</font>

1333
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,890
would object in the strongest possible

1334
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:26,290
terms to this draft although I would

1335
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,690
think the general idea of correlating

1336
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:31,660
streams is something that's worth

1337
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:33,400
considering so a case I wanted

1338
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,750
clarification on so that if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1339
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,820
two halves to the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the</font>

1340
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:38,770
header extension one is the stp<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1341
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,530
strongly opposed to the stp all right is

1342
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:44,500
your feeling on the header extension /<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1343
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:46,070
am strongly opposed to the SDP parts I'm

1344
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,330
overloading with format parameters

1345
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,850
the way you're doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

1346
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:52,790
understand that but the header XE header

1347
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:57,170
extension itself as Magnus's said is

1348
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:58,820
utterly trivial it's the way you I don't

1349
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,980
assign the identifier which is

1350
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,830
problematic once you figure out how to

1351
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:05,210
identify in the stream identify as then

1352
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:08,090
wrapping it in a header extension is

1353
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:12,170
trivial so you okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having a header</font>

1354
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:14,150
extension i am ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the concept of a</font>

1355
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:17,030
header extension for an appropriate

1356
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:18,860
identifier that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits trivial I think the</font>

1357
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:22,010
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier you're proposing</font>

1358
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">is broken unknowingly what your was what</font>

1359
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,070
you're saying is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've you see no</font>

1360
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:27,140
value in the header extension if there's

1361
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:29,210
no sdp mapping you know he's saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1362
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,890
me to define the appropriate identifies

1363
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,850
and gets agreement on that before you go

1364
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:34,009
to the head of excitement and

1365
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:36,529
appropriately I did I identify the

1366
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:38,240
identifier as es ID yeah but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1367
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:40,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">honestly you're inappropriate I think</font>

1368
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,229
your ears only<font color="#CCCCCC"> right posle is completely</font>

1369
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,750
broken once you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined an</font>

1370
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:46,430
appropriate way of identifying these

1371
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:48,980
streams then wrapping it in a header

1372
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,930
extension is trivial but the mechanism

1373
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,580
you're using took to identify the

1374
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:54,919
streams the identifier you've chosen

1375
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,960
does not work so once you have

1376
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">identified an appropriate identify then</font>

1377
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,770
sure will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a header extension</font>

1378
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:03,700
it'll take 10 minutes to write the draft

1379
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:07,730
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hard part right so Ronnie</font>

1380
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:11,839
I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what was said before</font>

1381
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:13,940
definitely definitely be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I'm this</font>

1382
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,010
I'm a little and extension doesn't make

1383
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,200
sense without the other part because

1384
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've said it's that she should not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1385
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,830
unique it depends on how you define<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1386
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">detest DP because the way of defining</font>

1387
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:25,670
now unless they pay what you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

1388
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you'd find me differently it may be</font>

1389
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:30,530
needed to be unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not it's</font>

1390
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:32,600
until you go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp part and define</font>

1391
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,820
how it's being used there's no reason to

1392
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,980
do this headaches tension<font color="#CCCCCC"> or that I the</font>

1393
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had this before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had this</font>

1394
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,520
before in the application ID that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1395
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,500
we try to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> well near the application</font>

1396
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,880
ID that that's the part that I disagree

1397
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,070
with I believe there is value in this

1398
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,450
without having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mean what I'm saying a</font>

1399
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,500
word can be separate and why you've

1400
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,990
actually Skyped the problem in the

1401
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,580
moment sufficiently people are coming up

1402
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,680
to the mic saying we don't believe this

1403
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,440
is right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you basically need to</font>

1404
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:59,690
go round the loop and basically have

1405
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,310
another look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the problem someplace if</font>

1406
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:02,590
that's what

1407
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:04,660
Manderson I heard I heard one I heard

1408
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:07,840
two objections to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDP mapping and</font>

1409
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:10,180
one and well both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

1410
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:13,090
there is no stp mapping then the header

1411
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:18,819
extension is of no value no<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1412
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:22,090
what the same but that is very briefly

1413
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:24,490
calling please so the fundamental part

1414
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:27,610
here is defining what the identifier is

1415
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:30,250
to correlate streams I think you're the

1416
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:31,480
way you have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is broken so</font>

1417
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're thought the way you have</font>

1418
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,830
included it in sdp is broken therefore

1419
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,750
the way you're including it in in RTP is

1420
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:40,450
Brazil because the identifier is wrong

1421
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:42,850
if if I demonstrated a use case for this

1422
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:45,160
that did not involve<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp and I could</font>

1423
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,779
demonstrate value I think I think your

1424
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,839
fundamental problem is the identifier

1425
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:52,300
yeah I'm not not what I'm saying is it

1426
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,800
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could demonstrate a use case where</font>

1427
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,680
I'm identified I think you're missing

1428
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point I'm not a I am NOT objecting</font>

1429
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,359
to your use case I understand your use

1430
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,310
case i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use case is important</font>

1431
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,340
and needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be solved I mean I think</font>

1432
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:09,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the particular solution licked is broken</font>

1433
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:11,980
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this has identified people</font>

1434
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,569
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you don't</font>

1435
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,110
need to wait till the next meeting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> re</font>

1436
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">spin this problem right basically get</font>

1437
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:20,320
them on your side maybe that will

1438
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:22,330
identify that you actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1439
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,830
and do some n<font color="#CCCCCC"> music work as well take</font>

1440
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the opportunity here to talk to their</font>

1441
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:28,000
music chairs possibly with in

1442
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,529
conjunction with other people and see

1443
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,550
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go next but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you're</font>

1444
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,730
basically going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have an re</font>

1445
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:35,380
spin at the draft so that it actually

1446
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:37,330
more clearly says this is something that

1447
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,890
is valid this is the header extension

1448
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:40,960
that encompasses that thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now</font>

1449
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,819
valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we go to the</font>

1450
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,430
question of why a little comment which

1451
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:47,230
is maybe I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hallucination but</font>

1452
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,759
I think everything that's in this this

1453
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this draft or at least all the header</font>

1454
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,610
extension stuff could go in the fray

1455
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,900
marking and be entirely useful there

1456
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,780
that's what I was so sure I'm not

1457
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:57,580
hallucinating along good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

1458
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:59,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they have</font>

1459
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:02,950
all these bits for everything except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1460
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:05,020
no well I'd be totally happy with that I

1461
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:06,640
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that people</font>

1462
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,930
are actually happy with the thing that's

1463
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,259
being shoved in that's basically the

1464
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,259
problem

1465
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay more discussion on the list</font>

1466
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:24,180
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> or discussion or can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we skip</font>

1467
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:26,430
to the last night<font color="#CCCCCC"> the latter very less</font>

1468
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:30,569
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so basically i would i would</font>

1469
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:34,799
like to know not very last very honestly

1470
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:36,510
i haven't got<font color="#E5E5E5"> any slide one person so i</font>

1471
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,120
would like to know from the working

1472
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,980
group as a whole whether they think even

1473
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,509
independent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's worth having</font>

1474
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,950
a header extension I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've</font>

1475
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:46,950
reached that point yet i'm not seeing

1476
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:49,740
sufficient support in the room yet I'm

1477
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:51,779
seeing simpler we had one president yeah

1478
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,399
support so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying we're killing</font>

1479
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:59,430
this what I'm saying is you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1480
01:04:53,400 --> 01:05:02,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and Reese pin the discussion okay</font>

1481
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:04,220
is it I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if anyone else</font>

1482
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:08,040
is interested in the header extension

1483
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:09,629
independent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stp or I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1484
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,970
anyone is objecting to the header

1485
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:13,970
extension that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem here</font>

1486
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:19,890
right but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is not the idea of</font>

1487
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,529
putting a header extension to correlate

1488
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:24,330
streams that's a wonderful idea the

1489
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:26,640
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the particular thing you're</font>

1490
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:29,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to use as the header extension</font>

1491
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,680
the particular identify your choosing

1492
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:33,810
it's just a number that identifies the

1493
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,980
zinc<font color="#CCCCCC"> Otis yes but when the and then</font>

1494
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,930
you've chosen a number that represents

1495
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,650
apples and he's saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one there</font>

1496
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:40,529
should be a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> that represents</font>

1497
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:41,970
oranges that you have chosen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in</font>

1498
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:43,890
a way which overloads the format

1499
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:45,990
parameters no no I in no way is it

1500
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:47,580
forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and just forget</font>

1501
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:54,060
about the format Brad that's the

1502
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:56,549
important part right right right yeah

1503
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've the chairs of a more fun right</font>

1504
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:02,360
or exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> look we are that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her way I</font>

1505
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:02,360
used without sdp will

1506
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:12,970
yes right so okay right meeting closed

1507
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,970

1508
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,830
