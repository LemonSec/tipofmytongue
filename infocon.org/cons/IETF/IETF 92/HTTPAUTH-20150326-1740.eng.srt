<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I managed i managed to stamp them they</font>

2
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,790
couldn't get my phone on the ITF network

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,699
they ended up blaming Microsoft

4
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:44,970
okay two months later might as well

5
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:50,789
start okay good afternoon welcome to the

6
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:53,700
HTTP authentication working group this

7
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:55,440
slide has some useful information for

8
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are remote and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own has</font>

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,658
volunteered to to relay messages that

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,149
they would like I'm not aware of any

11
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:14,390
anyone who's attending remotely but just

12
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:14,390
in case close enough

13
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:24,770
so you might have seen this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some point this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Barry's a shorter</font>

15
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:41,240
summary so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this blue sheets</font>

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:45,680
are circulating we have a note taker we

17
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:50,090
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> jabber scribe will do the agenda</font>

18
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,310
bashing in a second and document status

19
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,570
now this meeting is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

20
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">dedicated mostly to mutual off so let's</font>

21
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin with document status anything else</font>

22
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:06,500
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything else on the</font>

23
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">agenda other than we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fat okay so let's</font>

24
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:16,730
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with document status some of our</font>

25
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,440
documents have progressed so hoba was

26
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,769
still a working group document at

27
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Honolulu we have just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finished</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a working</font>

28
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:31,250
group last call now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's RFC 74 86 this</font>

29
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:34,310
group's first RFC basic authentication I

30
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:38,720
just started working group last call at

31
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:43,130
Honolulu it's now past is g review and

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,310
is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RFC a t-test q and digest</font>

33
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,650
digest was just a working group document

34
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,530
since then we've gone through working

35
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">group last call and have sent it to</font>

36
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">kathleen so now it's in ITF last call</font>

37
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,140
and we thought has something say about

38
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,140
that so could you step up

39
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks so where we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been discussing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font>

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:18,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the stun him order the tram work</font>

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,180
group is working on a stun a base top

42
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,510
did the stump protocol and they would

43
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">like us to or they would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

44
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">same mechanism that digest mechanism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

45
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">line with what we are proposing here but</font>

46
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:37,800
they have the quest to update their the

47
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:41,570
way we calculate a one which is a that

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">digests for username and password and</font>

49
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:50,130
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add a assault to that</font>

50
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,410
take calculation so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is so I</font>

51
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,240
have a few questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

52
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:59,130
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in a ATF last last call but</font>

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is this covered by the</font>

54
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter first and I think we did add few</font>

55
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,080
capabilities new capabilities to that

56
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,470
digester<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming that's may be</font>

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,490
covered by the Charter and it's all

58
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:18,030
should we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that capability</font>

59
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:21,300
into that the current draft just delay

60
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,969
it and add this capability and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

61
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,960
and introduced in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current draft or</font>

62
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:30,330
maybe introduce a create a completely

63
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,969
new draft just to address that aspect of

64
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:39,479
a obvious a request so k comments and

65
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,730
you have new with no hats this salted

66
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,640
you meant is that there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

67
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,710
challenge that comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server yes</font>

68
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,099
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea when you create that that</font>

69
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,650
count on the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create an H here</font>

70
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,640
one which includes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> digest for</font>

71
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,700
username password and assault selected

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,400
by the server and when that server

73
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,219
challenges that the client it will also

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,039
send that salt back to the client to be

75
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,390
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that calculation this kind</font>

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,540
of sounds to me like chap or md5

77
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,650
challenge and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these is a really</font>

78
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,880
good

79
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,109
authentication mechanism and then

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,759
personally I don't see why we would want

81
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:28,740
to standardize at this point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

82
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,380
kind of inferior mechanism like that I

83
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,780
mean we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going with basic and digest</font>

84
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,830
because their historical and legacy and

85
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,659
stuff but right now standardizing chap

86
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:43,590
sounds to me like not such a good idea

87
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,530
but but floor is open bye it's like that

88
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,560
digests is used all over the place and

89
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,250
this just improves this a little bit

90
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,110
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that username</font>

91
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,539
hashing for example so so we did few

92
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,780
improvements to that current mechanism

93
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:05,070
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it might make sense to know</font>

94
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:09,030
at that in a bit oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can I ask</font>

95
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:11,219
technical question sure so assault is

96
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,580
shared by all users of the same server

97
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,240
or no I hope you'll be using in that

98
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">case in current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> latest scheme you first</font>

99
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,470
cherry request visit any of syndication

100
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:27,840
information and returns<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sabha the</font>

101
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,949
authentication server fastened edges so

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">service returns the salt servers nones</font>

103
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:37,970
with that in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without any information</font>

104
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,150
about the user name so in e in this

105
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorted case you must have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passed sent as</font>

106
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,630
user name of us to let server returns

107
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:54,599
the correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> salts to eat for each user's</font>

108
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:58,409
how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it done so i'm lata so to return</font>

109
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,139
the power user salt<font color="#CCCCCC"> saba master</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast</font>

110
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each user is accessing to write</font>

111
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,940
but in current digest scheme<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

112
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,159
requests do not have any users in

113
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,250
general before somebody tells the

114
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:16,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">savannahs instantly don't have a user</font>

115
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,830
what do you mean in digest<font color="#E5E5E5"> username is</font>

116
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:22,590
sent along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client shot response</font>

117
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,590
nothing too fast and authenticated

118
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:31,900
request so how it can be done

119
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:36,890
easy my end snd<font color="#E5E5E5"> groan what sorry this is</font>

120
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:41,449
matt Lipinski um so I just to rephrase

121
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:44,780
the question from the microphone ah if a

122
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:48,980
server has a different salt for every

123
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:53,420
user then the server needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

124
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:56,090
that salt to the user right so the after

125
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,900
the server gets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> username the server</font>

126
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:03,290
would then need to send the salt to the

127
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,380
user right um and so I believe the

128
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is how does this exchange map</font>

129
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:15,830
to the existing messages for digest

130
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:21,680
authentication not picky gonna I am a

131
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:24,680
quota also studies so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a soul</font>

132
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,790
per user it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the user</font>

133
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:38,300
okay see I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay that makes</font>

134
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:41,540
sense okay yeah I see okay so obviously

135
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,609
we'll ask again on the list but how many

136
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:50,930
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here think we should pull back</font>

137
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:54,650
digest and add this feature just<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise</font>

138
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,709
your hand if you think so and how many

139
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:01,490
think we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do this raise your</font>

140
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:04,130
hand okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about four or five</font>

141
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:10,360
people who care and all of them don't

142
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:12,740
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pull this back sorry okay</font>

143
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,310
anybody else i<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

144
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,310
don't care

145
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:26,709
ok how many don't care at all about

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:28,449
digest wow that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot Mike Jones</font>

147
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft let me ask a clarifying</font>

148
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:35,290
question about this decision and others

149
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:38,649
probably have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question too is that</font>

150
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:44,110
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current version of digesting last</font>

151
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:51,040
call protocol compatible with the one

152
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:53,019
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old version of digest yes a new</font>

153
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,540
server would work with an old client and

154
00:10:53,019 --> 00:11:00,429
vice versa and so the change data salt

155
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,240
would actually be a breaking change is

156
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:06,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct well the client would</font>

157
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,959
ignore it because it's an unknown

158
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,249
parameter and then well it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

159
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,239
we structured but you could structure

160
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:19,800
that they'll still work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other</font>

161
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:23,290
yeah so you could create a different

162
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,498
entries in the in down in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table of</font>

163
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,389
all those say those algorithms and and

164
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:30,459
you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could you could indicate</font>

165
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:33,100
that is this altered version or an

166
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,109
unsalted version right so that's doable

167
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,589
right actually thinking it over it won't

168
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">work because you only do that if your if</font>

169
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,730
your password<font color="#E5E5E5"> database is anyway</font>

170
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:46,120
assaulted and hash them you don't have

171
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,040
access to the original passwords so then

172
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,459
unless the client supports that you

173
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,410
really can't authenticate right because

174
00:11:51,459 --> 00:12:03,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just don't have yet this string to</font>

175
00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:12,910
compare to so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ben are you in the room ok</font>

176
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:14,860
and anybody was remote ok so i guess and

177
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,480
i haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the working group so</font>

178
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,369
take this with whatever grain of salt

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,649
you want unintended I as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can</font>

180
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:25,899
do the addition without breaking

181
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,660
backwards compatibility for existing

182
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,110
uses I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

183
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a breaking change</font>

184
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,829
that's a bigger deal and you need to

185
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a working group decision to do that</font>

186
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:42,680
I would think okay fair enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I</font>

187
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:44,630
think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care whole discussion</font>

188
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,459
about the compatibility and acidity and

189
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:54,589
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so I agree is make</font>

190
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:57,979
up to date draft for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,550

195
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,029
agrees with it what update doing it as a

modification in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short notice is not</font>

197
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,339
a good idea so you're saying creator I

198
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,700
can separate draft update I person I

199
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that is a bit allocating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so one</font>

200
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,550
more question for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room of this matt</font>

201
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:31,430
lapinskas chair so is if this could be

202
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">done in a backwards compatible fashion</font>

203
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,089
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we still would need</font>

204
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,829
to work out on the list but if this

205
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,430
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a backwards compatible</font>

206
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:43,399
fashion are there people in the room who

207
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,410
think that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a a bad idea who have</font>

208
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,510
serious so there we heard the backward

209
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,579
compatibility concern are there other

210
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:53,990
separate concerns that people have about

211
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:56,390
making this type of change so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

212
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">love to hear from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone who had other</font>

213
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,620
concerns just to make sure that we've

214
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:02,620
captured all the concerns in the room

215
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,560
Benkei doc I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be worried about</font>

216
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,449
working group energy and if there are

217
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,229
better things we could do with that

218
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,229
energy we have

219
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,080
yep our security will not be decreased

220
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,890
in any way but how much increased how

221
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,470
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy we read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the security</font>

222
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,480
issues or how we can tell in the

223
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,070
security consolation how will we can

224
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:47,260
tell users<font color="#E5E5E5"> about its security strengths</font>

225
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:47,260
not create this moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh 5 centimeter</font>

226
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok we're taking it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last anyway</font>

227
00:14:51,079 --> 00:15:01,870
and with that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mutual loss</font>

228
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:04,640
presentation one more question to refer

229
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:07,459
could you please make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear on the</font>

230
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:15,980
list what is the threat model that we're

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve here this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Utica was</font>

232
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,959
speaking in next please so I remember I

233
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:26,240
have some status update in the the

234
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:33,589
meeting before the previous meeting in

235
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:35,810
90 so after that I adopted the to accept

236
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:39,020
several comments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion and</font>

237
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:44,209
added several things new things to draft

238
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:48,860
fastest as as the same way as a

239
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:52,219
digesters<font color="#E5E5E5"> I incorporate RSC 598 94</font>

242
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:00,859

243
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,120
incorporated it in Prezi username

245
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:13,370
incorporated indeed and the second

246
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:17,810
change is internal thing but several

247
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:21,440
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked some string format concern</font>

248
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:25,219
is the web origins concept so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I changed</font>

249
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,850
to remove this 80 the string so that it

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say use the same function</font>

different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now it's very clear</font>

260
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:11,610
about that and also I borrowed or

we have a issue tracker in the working

284
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:33,720
of this month i sent 18 questions to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for people so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i say</font>

289
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,950
18 questions listing similar comments

290
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,100
has been only deceived<font color="#E5E5E5"> so thank you very</font>

291
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,280
much for these comments and in this

292
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,740
presentation I will repeat some of these

293
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions in the next few slides next</font>

294
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:04,050
please so first this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a confirmation</font>

295
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:08,959
question so to send the utf-8 strings in

296
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:13,080
the headers I introduce our HC five-nine

297
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,080
887 stirring home construction so if

298
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,110
user name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of France</font>

299
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,760
as this it is encoded as a usual header

300
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:26,459
with quote to incorporate the space so

301
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,160
but if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no ascii character in the</font>

302
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:36,540
string name string it will be encoded

303
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:40,010
like this is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think it's</font>

304
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,780
compact com it's consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other</font>

305
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:47,000
draft discussions I think it should be

306
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">done in this way any comments about that</font>

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:58,800
no the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next please so the next question</font>

308
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:01,770
is encoding wishes so it's me<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

309
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">hillock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is always</font>

310
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an issue if you have to have</font>

311
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,970
a purser to handle both forms but it

312
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,880
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the way we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it so</font>

313
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:19,770
that's how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is thank you</font>

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,770
so this draft is actually the 5,000th

315
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,140
LSD in the age of five thousand so there

316
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,620
has me explicit character set parameter

317
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:33,520
and they are also being a language

318
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:36,459
parameter but in this draft I want to

319
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,870
fix these<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters to the utf-8 and</font>

320
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,220
with no language parameters because the

321
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,649
rationale for that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a</font>

322
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">negotiated parameter in this protocol so</font>

323
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:53,440
if the this string is used as a binary

324
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:57,090
data in many places including input to

325
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,800
hush so if a client for example st.

326
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:03,959
simple one it's okay but for example if

327
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,960
clients in the fifties or something like

328
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,800
some data such as a conversion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

329
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Korea so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sabah cannot do a reliable</font>

330
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,440
conversion and so also in this case

331
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,500
there is no me no make no sense for

332
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,200
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid provision like this so I</font>

333
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,350
think this can be fixed in this should

334
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,720
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed please yes I agree with you</font>

335
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's quite sensible way of doing</font>

336
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,960
this we don't want to propagate any new

337
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,389
other character sets at this point so

338
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,590
yeah thank you very much ok next please

339
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,830
now that's also consistent with what

340
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,800
we've done already in basic everything

341
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:52,210
to be great but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this in basic they</font>

342
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:55,020
say it's undefined but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say it</font>

343
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:59,910
must be this in this way yeah thank you

344
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,810
and failure reasons i have several

345
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:05,460
discussion already in the mailing list

346
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:08,200
please you just discussed

347
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,460
internationalized<font color="#E5E5E5"> usernames what about</font>

348
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,950
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they profile proceed ok</font>

349
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,260
app for the pre see profile password

350
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,440
password is also processing the

351
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,480
addressee profile and in this protocol

352
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,670
password will not st. in Korea so there

353
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know including visions ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> duh but</font>

354
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,490
of course up<font color="#CCCCCC"> string preparation issues</font>

355
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,530
exist for them yes what yeah not to have

356
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,980
to prefer before you hash or whatever

357
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:39,770
with es es s password is prepared in the

358
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,590
press if a show and then incorporated

359
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,720
into the hash functions and others but

360
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:49,580
yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and so there has been some</font>

361
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:55,190
interesting discussion of the meeting is

362
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:57,560
about thousand how it can be handled if

363
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,510
the authentication has been succeeded

364
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sabah do not accept that the user</font>

365
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">forza so authorization has been failed</font>

366
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,990
after the successful authentication so

367
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:12,830
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been interesting decision so</font>

368
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:18,140
please check it on the mailing list next

369
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:21,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">please and there is several parameters</font>

370
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,980
embedded into the iron draft like

371
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:34,360
society must be has muscles at least 18

372
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:37,580
bits of<font color="#CCCCCC"> admit of us a size or more and</font>

373
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:42,350
not at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> attitude gnosis must be</font>

374
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:44,840
active in any time to reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> four seats</font>

375
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyeballs will accept because it is</font>

376
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:52,909
because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sabah only accept one not</font>

377
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:57,730
gladness at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time it will not work</font>

378
00:23:52,910 --> 00:24:00,860
well even with HTTP 1.1 and if we have

379
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple streams in HTTP to it will be</font>

380
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have me Salamis except</font>

381
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:12,590
several requests at the same time but

382
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:16,430
also if infinite number of gnosis can be

383
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:19,760
accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the from the client server</font>

384
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:22,610
cannot perform the duplicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gnostic in</font>

385
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,100
the constant memory so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a some</font>

386
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:28,490
kind of window mechanism into it so this

387
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:31,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a minimum size of the window I think</font>

388
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:35,690
SATA 2 is a good value for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and also</font>

389
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,519
sister crediting so is defined to be 60

390
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,200
second for

391
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:45,249
the minimum so grant can expect if first

392
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:52,779
we exchanged some session key it can be

393
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">used for the next 16 seconds you're a</font>

394
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:58,599
venir with no hats in HTTP two they're

395
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,789
talking about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more streams than</font>

396
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,849
that talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about hundreds of streams</font>

397
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:09,279
at the same time so if you limit the

398
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:11,559
number of active<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonces 232 you giving</font>

399
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,639
the server a challenge because I hat in

400
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:17,320
one hand it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those hundreds of</font>

401
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:20,439
streams on the other hand it can only

402
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,239
challenge and 32 of them yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugly</font>

403
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,329
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite something that gets me</font>

404
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:29,529
we made this is a minimum body but maybe

405
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:31,599
we can raise a minimum or 64 128

406
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,859
something like that oh yeah we would

407
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,059
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wouldn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server to</font>

408
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,889
overwhelm the client beyond what the

409
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:43,658
client implementation is willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

410
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:45,789
tolerate her ism I don't really know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

411
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:49,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve it them unless we say that the</font>

412
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:53,619
client can just block and not replying

413
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">to more than 32 yeah over 32 of the</font>

414
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:59,408
streams yes if some of the 32 and

415
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:02,799
clients already sent such a cutie

416
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:07,299
request can't must wait and rerun this

417
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">boss so if they in that case saturday is</font>

418
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:13,499
too small I think yeah thank you very

419
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:13,499
much I will increase in some way

420
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:24,970
any other comments about that thank you

421
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:28,530
next please and we have we always<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

422
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:32,380
an eye on a consideration section and

423
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:35,080
there might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes we have to define</font>

424
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:38,440
some requirements day before adding new

425
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,379
algorithms like it algorithms here means

426
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,770
choice of cryptography and kilometers so

427
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:48,670
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some labels for</font>

428
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirement so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think Alex required</font>

429
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:54,070
level is proper but how do you think

430
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that and well sink things to</font>

431
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider it we have like a secure shell</font>

432
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:03,639
protocol we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a range of private use</font>

433
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,660
identity so experimental one do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

434
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to follow this but in some sense this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

435
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">a requirement to use officer then in</font>

436
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:16,050
some sense of cell range of the

437
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameter names how did is it okay if</font>

438
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,990
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I have shot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too i</font>

439
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,320
want to add shot three yes I think

440
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:33,610
expert review should be sufficient if

441
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,129
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual protocols and then</font>

442
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:41,860
that would require an RC its algorithm

443
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:44,710
sets algorithm sets in my opinion now if

444
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:48,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">we require RFC's were giving a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

445
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:51,790
work to the ITF for standardizing be the

446
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:55,570
ghosts part and the CLEF yup are all

447
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:58,990
other vanity vanity crypt awesome the

448
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,260
RFC required does allow independent

449
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,809
submission track or FCS it's not a GF

450
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:08,170
review her and it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

451
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:11,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea it's just conflict review</font>

452
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:14,770
rather than full approval but it's still

453
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:19,120
work I tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in favor of expert</font>

454
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:20,770
review for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of thing but do you</font>

455
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,100
nominate yourself to the to be the

456
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">expert</font>

457
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,700
so should we change maybe she should we

458
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:34,610
change the expected every day were

459
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:38,930
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that Kathleen any idea</font>

460
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:41,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the group is not really</font>

461
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,040
supportive of RFC required but do we

462
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:49,400
want specification requires our expert

463
00:28:43,040 --> 00:29:02,899
review that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with barely</font>

464
00:28:49,400 --> 00:29:06,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">basil Trask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway I could repeat it's</font>

465
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:16,640
for tall people though same for me just

466
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:19,689
double much better um we're talking

467
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:24,590
about an experimental draft here and

468
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,750
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning range of user IDs so I</font>

469
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,459
think specification required should be

470
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,440
more than enough right so you could use

471
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,720
an RFC or it could be just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stable</font>

472
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:39,800
reference do you have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font>

473
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:43,610
you want RFC required maybe we can have

474
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:46,610
some shaky today because something like

475
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:50,540
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be danced in some way so I think</font>

476
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:53,060
sorry repeat that sorry we my intention

477
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,620
was we need some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of labia about</font>

478
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,340
securities doing this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

479
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:01,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I give can check it in some way</font>

480
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,230
that's an intention for my well Jason

481
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,919
yeah so it could be specification

482
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:09,020
required with a designated expert review

483
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,140
which doesn't necessarily mean that you

484
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,500
need an RFC yes so the designated

485
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,880
experts should be designated experts

486
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,590
right who would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that capability</font>

487
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,590
yeah thank you

488
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,939
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that URL and what's at that</font>

489
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:35,800
URL if it's a document if it's a wiki

490
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:38,500
that changes every day if it's you know

491
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:42,180
the website that was stood up yesterday

492
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:54,130
versus another standards organization

493
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:56,080
but not Wikipedia um this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Mike</font>

494
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,460
Jones from Microsoft but right now

495
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,929
speaking as one of the josé editors

496
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that working group and this is just data</font>

497
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:07,630
for you decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do specification</font>

498
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,670
required with expert review and there's

499
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,500
text you could steal from the document

500
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,660
thank you might even<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to steal</font>

501
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,360
Jim shot as a designated expert but

502
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,600
that's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the area directors thank</font>

503
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:25,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and just one more comment</font>

504
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:29,290
because we did review the draft for

505
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:31,090
these requirements and I think it's

506
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through new another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rev soon is</font>

507
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">this something here no I don't know why</font>

508
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,550
I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be part of</font>

509
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,830
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Marie might be but anyway</font>

510
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,230
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments I asked is if a</font>

511
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:49,419
specification required could be an email

512
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:52,810
to an ietf list because we know you can

513
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:56,860
reference those links to that ietf email

514
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:59,560
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the archive and it's stable that's</font>

515
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,120
not changing so that's something folks

516
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,000
were kind of considering it in some

517
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,219
cases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be okay it depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

518
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,750
what it is but I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see how</font>

519
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:13,510
we can lower the barrier to entry for

520
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,710
these things I don't know if everyone

521
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:19,420
will agree but I didn't get pushed back

522
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:23,020
on the idea so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mcfadden from</font>

523
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:26,110
interconnect the replacement for RC 52

524
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:29,450
266 it's actually pretty clear on what

525
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,949
the specifications are required and

526
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,590
well there is a there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an update</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

527
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:39,450
fifty to sixty six and and so you're not

528
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:45,029
you're hoping to rev it again it could

529
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:46,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a yes or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no so I believe that</font>

530
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan because i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the Rev</font>

531
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,168
that just happened we were limiting what

532
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,570
was actually revved in it and when

533
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:56,850
several of us in the iesg gave comments

534
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,590
I believe I don't think I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing</font>

535
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,240
drafts but i believe they said we'd have

536
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,158
the opportunity to add these in the next

537
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,980
revision and it didn't sound like it

538
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:10,320
would be far off I don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

539
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:12,000
it'll take the publish but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay under</font>

540
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,000
under the current fifty to sixty six

541
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,340
though a link would not be good enough

542
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,440
right thank you i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> check again for</font>

543
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,379
the definitions of expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> every rivet</font>

544
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,080
expert review and i will put something

545
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:35,130
different from now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on thank you very</font>

546
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:37,500
much next<font color="#E5E5E5"> please and this is a actually</font>

547
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,169
difficult for special about decision

548
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,470
fast how optional identification will be

549
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:46,799
handled in this experimental thing so my

550
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:50,460
proposal is actually this was compiled

551
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,289
before the discussion of HTTP piece 1.1

552
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:58,309
so my proposal is to other new head

553
00:33:54,289 --> 00:34:01,919
explicitly specifying optional

554
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:05,129
opportunity for authentication so the

555
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">good point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this is it is guaranteed</font>

556
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:10,409
by to be ignored by all the clients

557
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,770
because world<font color="#E5E5E5"> grant the header just</font>

558
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:16,500
sings as a some unknown attribute the

559
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:22,918
content so it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ignored</font>

560
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:25,739
so but in this number<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a HTTP piece</font>

561
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:30,569
version of the HTTP authentication

562
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:32,399
header so this RFC explicity says<font color="#CCCCCC"> saba</font>

563
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,619
may generate a Tubba Tubba Tubba

564
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,918
authentication header within other

565
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:41,429
response messages as a means others from

566
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:45,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">2401 header to indicate the spring</font>

567
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:48,179
might affect the response so in the text

568
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">this means it can be used for optional</font>

569
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,690
authentication so how do you think about

570
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that nearer the firewall vendor don't do</font>

571
00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:03,150
anything that defeats sanity checks www

572
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:06,329
authenticate never goes with 200 now yes

573
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,790
maybe someday it will I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhere</font>

574
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:12,780
there's a box that would really really

575
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:14,910
not like it yes by the way we are

576
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking at this point about the</font>

577
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:21,660
extension graft rather than the mutual

578
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:24,569
often yes so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it means for this</font>

579
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:29,220
experiment i think we can try this on

580
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:36,058
your head and see how it works it eat

581
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:41,520
any other opinion about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks next</font>

582
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:46,470
please so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one criticism to our draft</font>

583
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:50,099
is simply the string is too long do you

584
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:54,540
think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> too long for the HD favor</font>

585
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:57,470
because it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only made a pass a</font>

586
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:01,700
feeling question but people complaining

587
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:05,069
why you do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of long headers but</font>

588
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">in their case hdtvs people trying to</font>

589
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:11,430
compact the headers at math most as

590
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:14,670
possible so i would like to change it

591
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:18,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit like this is it okay for me</font>

592
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:20,609
to change this it's your header you can

593
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:26,240
change it to however you like the term

594
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:31,710
having looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at packet captures of HTTP</font>

595
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:34,680
this is nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've heard from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

596
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:38,660
of caching proxies that anything under

597
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">half a que does not concern them at all</font>

598
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:46,868
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next piece</font>

599
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,930
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consideration again this is</font>

600
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:55,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the final question so intention what is</font>

601
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:58,480
is this hey does for example just as my

602
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:02,760
head<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mkhize proposal to the basic</font>

603
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:06,780
several people proposing some a small

604
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,820
extension to the HTTP authentication but

605
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,460
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the header field is defined</font>

606
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:15,520
for each authentication schemes you

607
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,730
cannot do it in the share the fashion so

608
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,520
you can propose small extension to basic

609
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:23,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it cannot be used by digest so this</font>

610
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,420
headlight this experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

611
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,669
authentication extension header is a

612
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,460
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> client can be used as a catcher</font>

613
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,440
extension point for trivial

614
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:35,170
authentication extensions like you can

615
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,740
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for only for one day or something</font>

616
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:40,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should you can use this</font>

617
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:44,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">username for syndication tires or</font>

618
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,970
something like that so it's very yeah

619
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:51,810
katal thing so we should be good there

620
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be a ruse requirements as</font>

authentication cryptographic<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm</font>

622
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:00,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i chose the specification required</font>

623
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:03,609
for this place but it means following

624
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,800
the previous discussion we can also know

625
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:13,810
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about for this one how do you think</font>

626
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that Oh Matt Lipinski is an</font>

627
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:18,099
individual I think specification is

628
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,839
specification required is appropriate

629
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:21,839
here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe thank you</font>

630
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:32,740
yeah yeah I intentionally avoided any

631
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:35,470
expert review because it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used as</font>

632
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:40,959
long as the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is stable it can</font>

633
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:43,620
be used I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of the people</font>

634
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">who are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> truly aware of what this</font>

635
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:52,900
client hints are you elaborate on what a

636
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:56,340
client hint is for cryin sorry can you

637
00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:00,730
repeat pressure what is the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> hint</font>

638
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:05,290
current hint means like sorry client

639
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:08,530
hint means a cramp in this extension

640
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:10,540
grant can ignore any directly with each

641
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:14,340
grant does not understand are not

642
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:20,170
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow us all but for example</font>

643
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:23,830
sub in HTTP authentication server may we

644
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:27,250
have explicit robot header from service

645
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:31,330
to client but client because current

646
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a credential saba cannot</font>

force screens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> about forget about</font>

648
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:42,400
username in Posada credential but summer

649
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,780
camp in this extension sub I can tell

650
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:50,110
clients that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay performing robot this</font>

651
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,150
moment is good for users about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user</font>

00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">interface designer something like that</font>

653
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,910
so I called that's why I call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

654
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:04,450
crayon teens other things is the

655
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:07,779
username extension like II so if for

656
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:11,259
example for Reuters or some appliances

657
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,360
there is only one user but it in that

658
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,570
case without syndication requests you

659
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,300
may maybe you the user name you want to

660
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:21,610
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one so it's a user name</font>

661
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,580
extension of course it can be also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

662
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">gounod by users but it's a hint for the</font>

663
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,940
client

664
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:36,349
thank you next I'll please so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

665
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:40,129
have any other comments as well of

666
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:43,790
course my eating disorder is not a

667
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:46,520
limiting at least so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have any</font>

668
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:56,329
comments to the other questions as well

669
00:40:46,520 --> 00:41:00,109
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doc so I guess</font>

670
00:40:56,329 --> 00:41:02,359
there's perhaps some reworking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

671
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:05,210
still needs to be done from splitting

672
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:07,549
the work into multiple documents so like

673
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:10,630
the the core mutual document does not

674
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:13,009
include the<font color="#E5E5E5"> string pake in anywhere</font>

675
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:17,780
don't be really helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to</font>

676
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:19,430
understand what the goal is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I can</font>

677
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,109
repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> retake the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sutton</font>

678
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,919
appear anywhere in the mutual of

679
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,480
document yeah yeah and you perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

680
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,280
are things other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> pakes that could</font>

681
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,530
be used for this purpose but certainly

682
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:34,160
what we have in mind is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> peek yes</font>

683
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:36,920
example and then you're in terms of the

684
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,890
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a particular</font>

685
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,990
mechanism we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide I don't</font>

686
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very clearly articulated</font>

687
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:48,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">your what the specific things are like</font>

688
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,329
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the J function do what I ate</font>

689
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:52,369
the ATM because<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe that could be</font>

690
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:55,250
even earlier in the document and more

691
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:57,819
detailed about what hahaha<font color="#CCCCCC"> facts are I</font>

692
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:02,440
guess I should probably send mail with

693
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:02,440
the more detailed things I have

694
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:10,830
thank you very much I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you so</font>

695
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:13,320
my intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that separating here</font>

696
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:15,630
abstract things to the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

697
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,380
specific things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> go the raft but it</font>

698
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:21,480
I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what what that's me in the</font>

00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">main draft is important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information for</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Haditha so i will add that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

701
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,710
very much actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

702
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,900
working group has covered as previously

703
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,850
but the values that you described as

704
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,260
announces it has seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

705
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:40,650
functioning more as sequence numbers i

706
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:43,820
Sabbah nose is a opaque binary and crap

707
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:48,180
analysis is almost like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret number</font>

708
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:51,030
is it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember where the server</font>

709
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:53,759
announces yes no it's not counter so NCS

710
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:57,510
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> North County so it's a counter yes</font>

711
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I think it might be slightly more</font>

712
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:02,190
clear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> readers to use sequence number</font>

713
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,260
because it's an absolutely not soon

714
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,080
assume it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> random I see</font>

715
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,850
thank you very much an o they shouldn't

716
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,670
assume that nonce is a random<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

717
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,259
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of documents now that</font>

718
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,810
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise against using</font>

719
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,390
randoms as monsters because well

720
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:22,440
uniqueness is not really guaranteed

721
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:27,270
randomness yeah reason for seeking use

722
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:31,380
of sequence number against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Nazis if</font>

723
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:35,009
crying since thousands of London ounces

724
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,650
before and in this in the 1000 in fast

725
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:41,010
request tsubame strictly the nose like

726
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:45,360
value against 1,000 various numbers so

727
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:47,820
in current edges I guess notification

728
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:54,600
check is not done<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that so</font>

729
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:58,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we for this repeat repeat attack is</font>

730
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,690
critical so we should use<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar which can</font>

731
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,169
be checked reliably that the intention

732
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:06,560
for using is a countess thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

733
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,560
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

734
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:14,320
yes so I will reflect discussions and

735
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,580
several comments I receives to the next

736
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:21,850
left and I I must admit that my English

737
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:25,690
is very precise defines the whole text

738
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:28,359
and how then we can proceed the next

739
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:30,910
step of a cigarette if you post a link

740
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:32,560
to the sources for the documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">consent patches to help the English</font>

742
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,820
thank you very much I i will put that

743
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">xml documents to the public thank you</font>

744
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:46,150
very much a case so now's the time to

745
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:51,990
ask the shaming questions how many

746
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have read the drafts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

747
00:44:51,990 --> 00:45:00,669
I'll raise my own hands as well that's

748
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:02,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so well actually we should separate</font>

749
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:05,590
this out how many read the mutual off

750
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:11,520
draft okay how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've read the</font>

751
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:17,350
extension graft ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithm wow</font>

752
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:21,790
that's pretty good and the other

753
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:25,569
question that's bound to come up about

754
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:27,340
security review of both well the

755
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:31,930
algorithms are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> collections of</font>

756
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:34,750
well-known well known algorithms but has

757
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:37,720
there been a security analysis of how

758
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:40,480
mutual<font color="#E5E5E5"> of combines design is that</font>

759
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">important and is that link from the</font>

760
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:49,690
graphical<font color="#CCCCCC"> it don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember seeing that</font>

761
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:52,450
of course for for my say hi really

762
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:55,210
checked ever that's a kitty but we need

763
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,368
external leave you for that yeah no

764
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,840
external review and because this is

765
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:02,920
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are going to be asked</font>

766
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,230
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GFE review even if it's only</font>

768
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good so since we</font>

769
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:17,109
do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have read at least</font>

770
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:21,059
one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these drafts you care to</font>

771
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:26,920
comment about how close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them they are</font>

772
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:35,109
anyone even you might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well stay next</font>

773
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:37,630
like I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's still quite a</font>

774
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:41,078
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work to be done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of make</font>

775
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:43,900
the structure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document more</font>

776
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:50,470
coherent and potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> refine the</font>

777
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:56,710
presentation so it's solid documents a

778
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:59,500
good specification instead I have

779
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:02,559
noticed in my review that there's quite

780
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:07,420
a few terms that I used before they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

781
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:09,790
defined resections before<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

782
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:13,059
the kind of thing that's kind of

783
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:15,130
structural thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i encourage Ben</font>

784
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:17,980
and I'll do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself to send this</font>

785
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,890
comments to the list and yeah I guess I

786
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:23,430
do have one sort of larger issue that we

787
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:26,348
could perhaps talk about as the group so

788
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:29,348
in terms of what the client and the

789
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:31,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">server need to do for their messages</font>

790
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:34,750
they send their verification behavior

791
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:38,348
there's currently i think in section 10

792
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:41,530
of the main document there's both a list

793
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:44,369
of a sort of general rules and then

794
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:47,609
there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flow chart diagram with</font>

795
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:51,190
steps for the flow chart in prose text

796
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:53,770
is it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess the question would be</font>

797
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,630
you do we want the float are we doing

798
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">also like state machine to be the</font>

799
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:00,190
normative part or do we want the other

800
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:03,369
rules to be bad yeah that's a question

801
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,829
because first<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will explain my</font>

802
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:08,559
intention because it says copy other

803
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:10,540
state machines state hunting is very

804
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:15,130
important for client-side for security

805
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:18,240
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i intentionally not specific state</font>

806
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:21,250
machine to the main draft so that even

807
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,609
implemented without a deep security

808
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:29,410
knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are not confused about that</font>

809
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:31,779
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> request comments from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting</font>

810
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Renee this is that you</font>

811
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:37,420
it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more of a specification</font>

812
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:41,589
requirement based so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I added</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Swiss</font>

813
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:44,260
kid get some pot fast so this is this

814
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:47,170
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steps this is a currently</font>

815
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:51,190
non-normative state machine which was

816
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:53,290
first in<font color="#E5E5E5"> television o matic fun so but</font>

817
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:56,560
kindly this list is not normally with

818
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,779
just a advice for the leaders<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

819
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:07,630
have a specification on the last section

820
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:10,090
before can can you go back this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

821
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:17,830
requirement based definition is a kindly

822
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:24,240
normative in my draft yes and viagra is

823
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:30,670
a next bottom it's a complicated it's my

824
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:32,529
yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font>

826
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:39,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">make diagrams like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this exactly I</font>

00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:58,000
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> subside document it's a figure as much</font>

831
00:49:49,270 --> 00:50:03,190
clearer yes thank you should see the

832
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,140
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> brother maybe actually that this</font>

833
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,820
kind of intersection this figure do not

834
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:14,080
fit into the one page of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

835
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">eyelashes for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we still</font>

836
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:21,569
keeps state machine at least as an

837
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">onomatopoeic because it really helps</font>

838
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:27,460
implementers including event honoring

839
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:33,759
implementers of our implementations if

840
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:38,110
as I think

841
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:41,340
state machine or both<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally</font>

842
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:43,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">prefer the state amassing expression</font>

843
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,610
question is it just your asking which

844
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:47,260
one is should be normative in case there

845
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:50,770
are differences yeah of course of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

846
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:52,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking it's the gist of it yeah then</font>

847
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,700
maybe you should say at the beginning of

848
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:59,160
the session which section relevant

849
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:01,960
section which one is normative and yes

850
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,359
currently saving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification based</font>

851
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,550
requirement basis lines normative and

852
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:15,400
state machine is non-normative

853
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:17,560
informative law anymore because we still

854
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">have eight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes and this entire</font>

855
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,980
session is supposed to be dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

856
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:25,029
this so i guess no<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my question it</font>

857
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,310
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this has already been</font>

858
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:29,860
brought up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a list so maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font>

859
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:32,980
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be asking if anybody else would</font>

860
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:36,970
prefer the state machine to the rules as

861
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:39,550
the normative part actually this was a

862
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:43,410
one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list</font>

863
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:51,630
button<font color="#E5E5E5"> omitted in this presentation so</font>

864
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:55,830
so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's duplicated so I</font>
