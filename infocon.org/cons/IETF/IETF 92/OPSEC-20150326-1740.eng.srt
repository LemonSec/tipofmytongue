22
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,389
important so where are we right now so

23
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:47,080
there was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> object meeting at the</font>

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous idea may redeem is because it</font>

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,780
was relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet on the email areas</font>

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,740
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new work was</font>

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:00,330
kicked off now nevertheless since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I EF</font>

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:05,770
90 we managed to get like three rfcs

29
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:07,990
published so that's reasonably good we

30
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:11,890
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one document which is right</font>

31
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,359
now in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg processing Fernando is on</font>

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,070
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:23,820
one that is being you know think they'll

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:27,410
fit pretty pretty well maybe a question

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,410
on the micro<font color="#CCCCCC"> recipe of shoulder</font>

36
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,290
so the document still has one discuss

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,470
which so far we have not<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with the ad on how to proceed but</font>

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,720
as far as I understand they are changing

40
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby's or some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s this week</font>

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,620
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess we will have to discuss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

42
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,630
with incoming ID yeah let's do that

43
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,090
sounds a good one then another document

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,530
will be progressed further on so that is

45
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,740
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a shepherd right up that's</font>

46
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,290
me still on my to-do list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we</font>

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,830
have the wonderful enjoyment about high

48
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:10,160
PR disclosure for one of the documents

49
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">misprint on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my cisco on RC six to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 192 so</font>

50
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,480
that is being hope it also somewhere in

51
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:21,589
parallel in the background like control

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,119
playing polishing or something others so

53
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,150
this way we are with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda we start</font>

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,600
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes late then we have 20</font>

55
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,240
minutes heretic and unfold with two

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,910
slots for phenomenal speak about in

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:42,250
genetic filtering and about ICMP ingress

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:42,250
filtering so let's start Eric

59
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,840
yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the big pink</font>

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:03,800
thingy and this one is spinning look

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,870
back pain prepare the<font color="#E5E5E5"> water anyway so</font>

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,810
it's a very long presentation let's

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">start immediately so does the elaborate</font>

64
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,870
on the draft that we started a long time

65
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,630
ago regarding the procedures to operate

66
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:24,740
securely in a pv6 network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> mary kay</font>

67
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:32,020
and kk dakota and the last one and since

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:36,080
last the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dress revision actually</font>

69
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,990
nothing was moving so what we did

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,080
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> refresh the references because</font>

71
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,510
a lot of draft from Fernando has become

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,159
now RFC so we needed to change this

73
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:52,400
change a few warning fix typos as I'm a

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:58,039
co-author my coder fix my English so

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:02,060
simply improving next and now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to-do</font>

76
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:05,300
list we just need to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

77
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,600
started this work in 2012 so that three

78
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,270
years ago we have security as we all

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,630
know it's moving target it's an

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,969
ever-changing field and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Fernando is</font>

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,590
the on the first row cannot save an

82
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,180
eight you are finding out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back so we</font>

83
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,729
need to update our document TV here so

84
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,850
stop working so we will get left moving

85
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:27,979
target<font color="#CCCCCC"> drove of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course so now we were</font>

86
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,889
working now for more than a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

87
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:33,650
three of us the authors to basically

88
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:36,289
push his document which was ready at

89
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,299
ninety-five percent and basically the

90
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">trio tirso is three part of text and we</font>

91
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,610
clearly use sometimes different

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">vocabulary different style and we wanted</font>

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a document which was nice from</font>

94
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the English and readability and clarity</font>

95
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,360
point of view but basically to be honest

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i think mary kay will agree with me</font>

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,780
we are running out of steam because you

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,280
know going from 95 99 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok going from</font>

99 percent 299

100
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,429
nine percent completion takes forever we

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">sincerely believe that what's inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

102
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got multiple comments already one</font>

103
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,889
year and a half ago when the document

104
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">was active and out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly complete in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the sense of siting and doing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

106
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,239
the aspect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all their issues and</font>

107
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,550
proposing mitigation techniques it's not

108
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,100
finished regarding ability what we

109
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:32,090
really believe document is finished

110
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,340
right so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really say this one should</font>

111
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,869
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that school know if you find</font>

112
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,900
issue in the last quarter usually we fix

113
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,120
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but the authors believe that</font>

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,510
we are really really early and we should

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,840
have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year ago basically next</font>

116
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:51,770
slide the thing is yeah that's it maybe

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to say something American yeah</font>

118
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,520
bit of clarification also so there were

119
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,320
a number of meetings even the RSA

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference that you know we were both</font>

121
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we'd sit down and do some</font>

122
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">word smithing and one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

123
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">we realize is that this document really</font>

124
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,390
is a comprehensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

125
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,430
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least 80 RFC's reference right</font>

126
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,789
that deal with any<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of security yeah</font>

127
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,040
and so we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the content is</font>

128
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,840
all there we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to wordsmith it</font>

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,450
and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it aesthetically a</font>

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,429
little more cohesive but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last time</font>

131
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,159
we looked at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt that you know it</font>

132
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,289
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be necessary so for us</font>

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be spinning those cycles and you know</font>

134
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:30,710
were all involved in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,960
work we felt that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably was</font>

136
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,270
actually ready for last call and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then if</font>

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">people had an issue while it was in last</font>

138
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,049
call then that's the time that we would

139
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:45,169
spend on fixing anything that was really

140
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:48,080
glaringly either wrong or missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

141
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,520
so just to get a feel of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room here</font>

142
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually has to read this document</font>

143
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great thank you</font>

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,370
okay so so something what I've seen also

145
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">which was happening like in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

146
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,270
document for going to like anakin

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,760
complete was nearly impossible or the

148
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,740
beach pre-filtering element the way they

149
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,940
circumvented it is to refer to

150
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular you know references to take</font>

151
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things into consideration to make</font>

152
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,480
a document actually more static that may

153
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,710
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you can look into words</font>

154
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,950
it's not so much the references that

155
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,570
changing it honestly I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

156
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,050
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to change all the idea to a</font>

157
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:32,020
receipt as for sure but we are adding

158
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,599
sometimes new fields for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

159
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,490
through post conferences the capitalist

160
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">way we'll get something like ma DS issue</font>

161
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,350
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> someplace to write another idea</font>

162
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,729
but we will not update our document

163
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:49,390
because that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

164
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:54,610
whatever it is already contain a lot of

165
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:56,560
thing been in operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I think</font>

166
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of the room like 28 people actually</font>

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,219
afraid it so what I'm made before going

168
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,810
to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> route possible actually you know</font>

169
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,760
is like people in the room willing to

170
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,560
give this you know a rate of the

171
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,180
document given you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feeling</font>

172
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,020
about how ready it is before we go to

173
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,060
the who know the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> up oh yeah it's 15</font>

174
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:17,860
20 pages I remember Fernando gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

175
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,290
recall going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the document but a</font>

176
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,760
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and for me at that point</font>

177
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">in time it was already in pretty good</font>

178
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,640
shape usually in my experience what the

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,410
times happens is that when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font>

180
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,180
goes through working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last codes</font>

181
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,439
when you get more people to read in so i

182
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,599
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's the way to go but</font>

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,260
that could be among the possibility

184
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,260
sorry cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

185
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:59,560
this one and so Fernando I'm present

186
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:04,389
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 10 but I get it</font>

187
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,819
doesn't matter okay so this is mostly an

188
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,589
update on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote</font>

189
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:11,439
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendations on filtering of</font>

190
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:16,449
ipv6 packets containing ipv6 extension

191
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,190
headers next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

192
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:22,269
essentially a document that is an ipv6

193
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,970
version of RSC 7126 the time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish</font>

194
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">a document on the filtering of ipv4</font>

195
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,259
packets containing ipv4 options so this

196
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,670
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> version of it the ultimate</font>

197
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,399
ultimate goal is that to some extent

198
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,959
this document my help with you know

199
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,060
improving the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of affairs</font>

200
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,310
when it comes to the you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets</font>

201
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,719
pin drop as a result of containing

202
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:49,000
extension headers it tries to summarize

203
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,329
security and operational implications of

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,189
extension headers and ipv6 options this

205
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,300
is again like the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

206
00:10:54,189 --> 00:11:00,219
for RFC 7126 so for each extension

207
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,180
header an option we try to summarize

208
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,009
what that header an option is useful and

209
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,979
what might happen if for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

210
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,750
were to drop packets containing them and

211
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,720
then what we try to do also is to

212
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,610
provide advice to what to do with you

213
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,560
know with each extension header and

214
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:23,529
option type next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,899
changelog since the last revision of the

216
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,329
document one of the things was that we

217
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:34,660
clarified that we assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the rules</font>

218
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:36,519
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 RSC 74 five are in place then</font>

219
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,860
regarding the hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope options</font>

222
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,120
actually just advise it to drop packets

223
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:48,160
containing hop-by-hop options and based

224
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,279
on working group feedback what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

225
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,250
is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> modified advice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say that</font>

226
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,899
well if the platform can process hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

227
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,990
hope options in the fast path they

228
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,449
should pass the packet otherwise they

229
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,459
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> bravely meet those packets but if</font>

230
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:05,469
the first option on the second option

231
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:08,969
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> available then as a last whistle</font>

232
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,920
they should drop those pockets and

233
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,500
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we clarified was done</font>

234
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,399
and that's essentially you know the same

235
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:22,180
discussion that we have for RFC 7126 is

236
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,310
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not really specifying</font>

237
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,109
configuration defaults but actually

238
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:30,670
providing unbiased on how to configure

239
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,829
devices that's essentially what what we

240
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,130
believe was at the time already the IETF

241
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:38,229
consensus so in those cases in which we

242
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,320
are let's say about advising to let's

243
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,740
say rate limit or drop some pocket is

244
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,370
not that we are advising implementations

245
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,720
to ship with our advice by default but

246
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,540
they should have their honor you know

247
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,730
there are defaults and then the guy

248
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,230
manually configuring you know the device

249
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:01,050
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably follow the advice that</font>

250
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:04,690
we are providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here next line so</font>

251
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:07,269
what's in our to-do<font color="#E5E5E5"> list I don't know if</font>

252
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:11,860
it was gender had suggested this a while

253
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:13,750
ago we will try to produce a summary

254
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,649
table with their<font color="#CCCCCC"> will summary of the</font>

255
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,329
advice I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

256
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,889
people had mentioned that you know

257
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,500
having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through the entire document</font>

258
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:26,649
and look up for the advice was not that

259
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,240
nice so it would be great to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

260
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,339
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just you know mentions the</font>

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,899
advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you want like you know if</font>

262
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:36,250
you want to look for the rationale for

263
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:38,470
that you can do it there are quite a few

264
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,949
sections that are mostly placeholders

265
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the reason of course is that I mean</font>

266
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,479
we're covering all day

267
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,730
caterers and options and some of them

268
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,339
are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> times are you know hard to find</font>

269
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,070
well what they were specified for and

270
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,470
what they are used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc so that's the</font>

271
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,050
other thing that is it's in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> to-do</font>

272
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">list for the next revision and I don't</font>

273
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,609
know if there are any comments or

274
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:08,130
whether we have you know miss anything

among other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's anyone</font>

hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that we you know we update</font>

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:28,889
the document accordingly without you

know finishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> their all the details so</font>

on board or post that on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

286
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:39,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list the idea is that if there's</font>

287
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,670
any high-level change that is required

288
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,649
you know we apply that you know as as

289
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,510
soon as possible as suppose at a late

290
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:49,889
stage I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it for this one</font>

291
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay just out of interest again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

292
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:57,930
like out of the room here who read this

293
00:14:52,649 --> 00:15:00,449
document actually 12 people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Jen</font>

294
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,160
link oh I read the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> version and</font>

295
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:04,560
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to look through the current</font>

296
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah a version of it here I probably</font>

297
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,268
will put some comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list my</font>

298
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,380
like first impression i don't know i

299
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:15,510
read it and it looks like you quite

300
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,490
often say device should drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

301
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,800
know if you should say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're polish you</font>

302
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,260
should not permit this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

303
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zach because it basically for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me I have</font>

304
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,730
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> double-check</font>

305
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we explicitly say this is no</font>

306
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,500
default configuration on the device this

307
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,170
is recommendation for a policy but all

308
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,220
text in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document as a device should</font>

309
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">buy / default dropsies so probably we</font>

310
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,509
should make more clear like we talked

311
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,180
about policy not about what forwarding

312
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:48,480
device does with the packet okay another

313
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,489
issue is do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might need to</font>

314
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,550
separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisors for like transit</font>

315
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,290
network and situation when you protect

316
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,599
your own network that's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

317
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,880
can go I said it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful because</font>

318
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read it as like forwarding device</font>

319
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,779
should drop that said but<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably you</font>

320
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,000
don't care if you just a transit

321
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,620
provider probably you do care if it's

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,370
your network can you protect in it and

323
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:14,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply these firewall rules on your</font>

324
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,690
router I might become your approach

325
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,220
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be completely different yeah</font>

326
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,750
that's actually that we you know we'd

327
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,949
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear from the working group</font>

328
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,589
because we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> even talked you know</font>

329
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:25,479
among<font color="#E5E5E5"> they co-authors and you know some</font>

330
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,029
of what we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this ID</font>

331
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,399
some were suggesting to you say well

332
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,779
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like that yeah what to make a</font>

333
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,810
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the transient routed</font>

334
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:37,180
from another one and but we weren't sure

335
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,709
about that so that's up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in</font>

336
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:50,529
you jamesha come if you are transit

337
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:51,910
provider you Cara with a buy option yeah

338
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,370
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just took a real quick look at the</font>

339
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,290
document in hearing Jen's comment and

340
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,529
from the gentleman<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind there I also</font>

341
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,360
think that looking at specific different

342
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,250
use cases like transit providers or

343
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,130
otherwise would have different

344
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,140
implications and so I would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

345
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,669
that language and but also promised to

346
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,220
read it in detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> that show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put some</font>

347
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:14,220
comments on the list awesome thank you

348
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

349
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,898
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a presentation about the</font>

350
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,428
document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ingress</font>

351
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:32,879
filtering defeating attacks which

352
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:38,429
employed for Jade ICMP error messages I

353
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,909
say kind of background a while ago I was

354
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:45,389
working on essentially on a document

355
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:49,200
about attacks that require spoofing ICMP

356
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:51,658
error messages the idea was quite simple

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,549
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were to spoof ICMP packet to</font>

358
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,460
Vigoroth messages claiming an MTU

359
00:17:53,549 --> 00:18:00,299
smaller than 1280 you could trigger the

360
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,799
use of fragmentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then as a</font>

361
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,750
result of the network filtering

362
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,610
fragments fragments then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would lead</font>

363
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,870
to the edenite of service I mean the

364
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,729
background is don't need it but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

365
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,939
explaining how we got into this document

366
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,210
this stuff was discussed in the basics

367
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,710
of mailing lists and a few folds

368
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,179
suggested or or we started discussing

369
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:23,130
how we could possibly filter ICMP error

370
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,320
messages to mitigate these attacks so

371
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,470
this is what this document is about next

372
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide so essentially if you look at vc</font>

373
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,330
p38 it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigating attacks that</font>

374
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:40,380
require the spoofing of the source

375
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">address but these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PCP silly 838 doesn't</font>

376
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,450
address icmp based attacks because when

377
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,459
you spoof ICMP error messages you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

378
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,679
really need to spoof the source address

379
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,320
of the outer pocket you need to put the

380
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,029
sorcerer or the addresses on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

381
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,779
that is embedded in the ICMP error

382
00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:01,350
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next line so this is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

383
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:03,269
very small refresher so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

384
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,549
we have caused a sending packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

385
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">koske on the other side and then this</font>

386
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,950
water find that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some problem it</font>

387
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,750
will send an ICMP or to cause a so the

388
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,179
Alvis is that you will get is in the

389
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,429
source address address be of course

390
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,409
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source destination address</font>

391
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,899
our essay which is the destination of

392
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,820
the error message and then in the

393
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,709
payload you will get a chunk of the

394
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,010
original packet of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

395
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,850
packet was directed from A to D so in

396
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,740
the source you will find a and

397
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,879
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination you will find thee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

398
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,890
I mean no no magic their next life so

399
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,230
this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an attack scenario which</font>

400
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,590
you have like you know some networks in

401
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,080
there and the idea in here is that you

402
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:51,070
have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> air occur in some point of the</font>

403
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,020
network that wants to attack the

404
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,899
connection between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two systems</font>

405
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the idea is that the are occur</font>

406
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,720
that is like connected to the network at

407
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,760
some you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> random message at some</font>

408
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,890
random part of the network wants to

409
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack the connection between these two</font>

410
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:12,850
guys now the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when this</font>

411
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,800
other person says spoof ICMP message it

412
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,389
doesn't really need to spoof the source

413
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,580
address why because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> error</font>

414
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,520
messages can come from any water so you

415
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to pretend or in person I any</font>

416
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,020
specific router so in this case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

417
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,630
are attacking for example the connection

418
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,330
between these two and you are selling

419
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,920
their own error message<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this guy the</font>

420
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,250
source address you can use your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

421
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,080
address this one the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

422
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,330
is going to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> target of the other</font>

423
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is this one but the address is that</font>

424
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,110
you are really spoofing are the two

425
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:48,699
addresses that are in the embedded pelo

426
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:50,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the error</font>

427
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,920
message from the point of view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

428
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,890
routing here there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with</font>

429
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,660
the assessing here but when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

430
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,190
the addresses that are in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

431
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,020
it's clear that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the error</font>

432
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,320
message cannot really come from this

433
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,690
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is essentially like</font>

434
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing English filtering but rather than</font>

435
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,130
looking at the addresses of the outer

436
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,110
pocket you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the addresses</font>

437
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:20,320
that are embedded in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pillow okay of</font>

438
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:25,510
course let's say if we have the source

439
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,250
service which is 222 so if it's clear

440
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,690
that you know a pocket that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from</font>

441
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet in this case assuming</font>

442
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,530
there's a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection of course</font>

443
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,540
could never have these services you know

444
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,520
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed and embedded palin so you</font>

445
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,440
could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> english filtering by looking at</font>

446
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:43,620
the addresses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bed pillow next</font>

447
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">line so this check is essential</font>

448
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,309
an extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bc p38 and the advice is</font>

449
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:55,920
actually in line with bc p38 next line

450
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:57,960
and this dissolve the rules we are

451
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,230
studying them in the same way as in bc

452
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,760
p38 when you look at the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

453
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,500
in the destination address of the

454
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,650
embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> bailar that is not the outer</font>

455
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,559
pocket can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back like choose yeah</font>

456
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,480
so you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the embedded packet</font>

457
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,639
in here right so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outer</font>

458
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,080
pocket no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look here because the</font>

459
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,970
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> is here are not going to be</font>

460
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,428
spoofed these are the addresses that are

461
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:25,110
going to be forged<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so two more yes so</font>

462
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,940
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination address and</font>

463
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:31,320
if the destination address of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 bedded</font>

464
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,660
payload is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you forward</font>

465
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,980
the packet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do essentially</font>

466
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">English filtering based on the</font>

467
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,540
destination address of the of the packet

468
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,280
that is embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the payload ok so in</font>

469
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,920
the same way as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do English filtering</font>

470
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,420
on the utter sorceress for the ICMP

471
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,830
error you do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on the</font>

472
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,670
destination address of the embedded

473
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:53,428
payload ah in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way as and in the</font>

474
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,590
same case as in bc p38 in the same way

475
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,300
that you can do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

476
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,879
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a University where spot</font>

477
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:09,860
forwarding yes you mean source address

478
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:14,970
ah let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the source address</font>

479
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:18,330
embedded packet you're right because if

480
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,809
if you take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure yes all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

481
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,809
yeah

482
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,149
think about go back a couple of them

483
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:38,110
because you put your ingress filtering

484
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:40,480
on the first rotor yeah now<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you</font>

485
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,790
look at the destination address because

486
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,200
that this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

487
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:48,909
are receiving a mess a wrong message

488
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:52,480
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so the filtering is happening</font>

489
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">here okay so that means that if a packet</font>

490
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,710
is coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> here this means that</font>

491
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,340
these Rooter eventually sent on this

492
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,970
link a pocket this time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

493
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:07,240
destination address that that's

494
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:09,670
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's like bc p38</font>

495
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,740
chastened embedded payload so from the

496
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,410
point of view so in order for this error

497
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,930
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate eventually this packet</font>

498
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,210
should have come up through this link

499
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now when you look at the</font>

500
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:27,880
destination address it is impossible

501
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:31,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a check that you can</font>

502
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">perform on any ICMP error message we</font>

503
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:39,970
think of this jackass and extension to

504
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:42,669
vc p38 of course it's different to check

505
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,790
on the you know sorceress of the outer

506
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,830
pocket as opposed to the address that is

507
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">embedded in the payload so there might</font>

508
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,929
be cases in which you could do like

509
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,810
traditional PC p38 but not look at you

510
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:58,380
know the addresses of the ICMP error but

511
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">again this is an extension to bc p38</font>

512
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:09,760
next slide so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

513
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:11,640
comments yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> john linka</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i I'm afraid</font>

514
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,040
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work in a very particular</font>

515
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">scenario for single lean no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

516
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,200
and niacin because just imagine you have

517
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,730
multi home in Kansas case nobody could

518
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,790
produce you symmetric rhodium cans

519
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,400
internet but easily they say I mean

520
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:31,120
isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 BC be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 38</font>

521
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">no well no because you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay could</font>

522
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:39,040
you please show picture yeah so

523
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,740
basically this machine on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left yeah</font>

524
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,490
it might help dual connection and send

525
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,900
packets to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet somehow yeah we</font>

526
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,020
should be coming back through nuzzling

527
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:53,230
your PF<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dangerous here you can enable</font>

528
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,910
it in very specific like topology and

529
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,130
all other cases just caught in traffic

530
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,080
but according yeah exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I'm</font>

531
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,640
saying is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they constraints for</font>

532
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,949
applying these are essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

533
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,310
countries constraint for applying bcp

534
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">380</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you or PF I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

535
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,540
thing I'm really concerned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

536
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:13,780
start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on router it's going to</font>

537
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,820
be dangerous because I a spiel etsy

538
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,710
start enabling this on the router and

539
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,780
then this network on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left getting</font>

540
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,940
dual connection and then they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

541
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,530
to ISP and explain to them that their

542
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,270
configuration is causing traffic black

543
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,980
hole what you're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

544
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,720
actually deep packet inspection it

545
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,640
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done on firewalls in very</font>

546
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,460
specific scenario close to destination

547
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,020
yes it shouldn't be done on the routers

548
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,180
we are not we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

549
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,430
document we are not actually saying on

550
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,250
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of device you should enforce</font>

551
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,200
this actually as you say probably in a

552
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,230
device such as a rotor you probably do

553
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:51,760
not do this but for example on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cpu</font>

554
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:54,340
could easily do this whole not sorry to

555
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,410
cook so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you get in a</font>

556
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,199
duel connectivity especially in case of

557
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,600
v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> but isn't that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case for busy be</font>

558
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,420
sorry I know already know because in

559
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,750
bcbg trade you always should always send

560
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,550
traffic with a proper source but reply

561
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,320
to some packet which might come to you

562
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,480
through completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different link might</font>

563
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,570
be sent through another link well<font color="#E5E5E5"> not me</font>

564
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,810
reply so you received<font color="#E5E5E5"> waited through one</font>

565
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,280
link can you send answer is ICMP to

566
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:24,580
throw a nozzle in because it's how

567
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,540
you're out in clerk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network yeah</font>

568
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,830
bc<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace protected you from sending a</font>

569
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,570
packet with the wrong source and you can

570
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,928
control this so

571
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,668
is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we divide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> war next time I</font>

572
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,649
whiteboard I said we need oh there are

573
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:42,019
some pictures here but believe me as

574
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:43,668
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's routing and it's not like</font>

575
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,799
firewall close to you James that when

576
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:47,419
you absolutely sure there is no but the

577
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,519
door to your network this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not gonna</font>

578
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:51,620
work on is gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous so I think</font>

579
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done on fire walls as a</font>

580
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,639
part of deep packet inspection of a

581
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:58,580
favor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice like any recommendation</font>

582
00:27:55,639 --> 00:28:01,479
related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be CP search shade okay it's</font>

583
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:04,279
my opinion I just I'm horrified

584
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,480
seriously is only good think nobody

585
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:10,730
gonna do this because they couldn't look

586
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:13,759
deep enough I understand what why you're

587
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,129
saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like PCP 38 but</font>

588
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,379
the problem I think is the fact that you

589
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:20,360
have to look deeper into the packet and

590
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:22,699
what I'm trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of now is you</font>

591
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,519
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true for any error messages</font>

592
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,529
for any protocol that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually say</font>

593
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,389
hey the error messages actually come

594
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:32,600
coming from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote spoofed</font>

595
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:35,750
source so while while I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

596
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:40,039
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and I mean people may</font>

597
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:43,429
need to be aware of this I am squinting

598
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:49,269
because I don't I'm I'm worried that

599
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:53,269
that that this can be misconstrued<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

600
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:55,399
um because<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if this document is</font>

601
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:57,590
out there that means that oh gosh we

602
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:59,120
should do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and what</font>

603
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,220
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing is deep packet</font>

604
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,500
inspection on absolutely everything and

605
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,889
from where on the cpe on the router on

606
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,419
the firewall what and so I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

607
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:10,250
about this a little more but I mean it's

608
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:13,610
it was if I well you'd probably do it

609
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:18,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for every error message I</font>

610
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:20,090
don't know yeah hmm since<font color="#CCCCCC"> I forgot I</font>

611
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:21,379
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't remember who</font>

612
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:25,279
discussed it sure when we're talking

613
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:27,590
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fragmentation header and this is</font>

614
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,179
host problem it's a host which is broken

615
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the host should verify her</font>

616
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:35,120
person suspected what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside behind</font>

617
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,809
this IP header is do I have actually any

618
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,049
TCP session which much what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

619
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:43,760
what I received we should fix host

620
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:46,070
implementation if it's if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack is</font>

621
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,420
actually possible not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

622
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:52,129
break crouch and they're actually there

623
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,560
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> two comments that I could</font>

624
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,630
may about that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that what</font>

625
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,669
you're saying is not correct but there

626
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a couple of problems there so first</font>

627
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,950
problem is that since you know the

628
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,170
extension header chain can grow as much

629
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,050
as you want then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are not guaranteed</font>

630
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:13,850
that in the embedded payload here you

631
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:17,480
are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a TCP header it's true</font>

632
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,399
for basically every single IC in pay

633
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,440
error message what we supposed to do if

634
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,570
you could not identify the sessions this

635
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,670
icmp everybody nowadays you accept them

636
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,649
again that we probably should fixes it

637
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:33,530
probably need some recommendation on how

638
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:36,350
to price what to do with precision I see

639
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Imperial messages on the host instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

640
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to fix every single possible</font>

641
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,410
attack scenario on the network level

642
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:45,020
when host is stupid enough and not

643
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,420
properly checkin if it's valid I see if

644
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,790
it has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> channeler two things so first</font>

645
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,560
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in theory you are not</font>

646
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:56,360
guarantee that you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get for</font>

647
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,129
example the TCP header here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok because</font>

648
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the original packet you know</font>

649
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">cesium same thing as always right</font>

650
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,790
extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> togethers you might get as</font>

651
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,230
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you want and since you only get</font>

652
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,420
like a chunk here for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

653
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">assume that you have a packet that has</font>

654
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:14,810
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1300 bytes in headers ok and</font>

655
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">then after that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the transport</font>

656
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,730
header<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chunk that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

657
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,200
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be 1280 and it's</font>

658
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,240
not going to contain the transport

659
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,120
Heather again let's discuss what host

660
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">should do in this situation it because</font>

661
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,010
if if it's a cut its targets to the host

662
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,629
and it hosts track which should deal

663
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:35,360
with it one now we get to the second

664
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:41,390
item I tried exactly that 10 years ago

665
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:46,060
thats RFC 5927 we took me seven eight

666
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:49,340
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your view</font>

667
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:52,790
let's say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> TC p.m. didn't agree on</font>

668
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,959
that that's why when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the</font>

669
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,149
ICMP

670
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,929
if occasions they kind of like say well

671
00:31:56,149 --> 00:32:01,639
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should look at 750 927 but</font>

672
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,340
are they kind of like they don't

673
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,350
recommend anything because<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP wasn't</font>

674
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,120
that much in favor of that did I get a

675
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,129
tried that<font color="#CCCCCC"> react really fixed not what</font>

676
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,459
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken but things which we could fix</font>

677
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:15,740
because we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this I think</font>

678
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,929
to be honest I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that two things are</font>

679
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,940
orthogonal so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes</font>

680
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:21,740
to the validation on the client side

681
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,049
that's something that should be done in

682
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,510
many cases is not done the simple

683
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:29,570
example is Linux the only thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

684
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,760
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know to guess to perform any</font>

685
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,309
ICMP vasotec on linux it's just the

686
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint addresses I try that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

687
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to even like boot like a</font>

688
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:39,770
valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol inside as long as you get</font>

689
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,200
the right addresses that's as much as

690
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,639
that's everything that you need so

691
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,380
that's one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so they currently</font>

692
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,080
they don't you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't perform</font>

693
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:52,460
that validation and on the other hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

694
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,439
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it you know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't do</font>

695
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,529
this sort of thing in any arbitrary

696
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:00,020
devices but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some in which you</font>

697
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:01,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do this kind of stuff and that</font>

698
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,440
prevents<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems that are you know</font>

699
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,700
behind the poem you know behind the

700
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,649
device where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are doing this</font>

701
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,020
filtering that you prevent those devices

702
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:12,649
from performing attacks against other

703
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:15,260
systems on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I so basically</font>

704
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:19,549
to summarize I believe the damage which

705
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:21,940
could be done comparing to damage which

706
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:26,389
we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent is much bigger</font>

707
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:29,059
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to cover one very specific</font>

708
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,799
particular use case and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even to</font>

709
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:33,549
fix it from the wrong side not where

710
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,168
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually broken and we give people</font>

712
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:43,399
even more so Jen you basically said what

I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to say about the Asura</font>

715
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,279
it's not basically DPI they<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply look</font>

716
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:56,720
about the state if they have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

718
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,419

719
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,429
I see an ICMP coming back not much no

720
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,900
matching then I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop it now if</font>

721
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:08,300
Lennox is buggy

722
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,540
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be fixed though yes Lee</font>

723
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:14,260
in any because don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> icmp error</font>

724
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,610
messages are critical for debugging and

725
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,370
there could be some case that we have

<font color="#E5E5E5">mess huh so I think the the mitigation</font>

739
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:59,810
block this even good packets indicating

740
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,480
an error because they've been some miss

741
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,610
routing or whatever or we will not see

742
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,560
them or put another way will you could

743
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:12,080
you come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a scenario where you</font>

744
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:16,600
know bc p38 wouldn't be breaking the

745
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:20,569
network and this stuff would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

746
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,980
this nice host on the left just let's

747
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,270
think about v6 because because it's

748
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and as this</font>

some packets to host on the rise through

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:38,150
the second link right and for some again

753
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home increase and the host might</font>

return package through the internet icmp

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:47,000
packets to internet right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

756
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,520
your scenario works only<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

757
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,410
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one single link from each host to</font>

758
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,140
the router and one wink from joe

760
00:35:54,140 --> 00:36:00,650

from from host on the Left will have

764
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:12,170
proper source yes about the host we show

765
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,880
you're saying is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these node for</font>

766
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,710
example has feelings just to check if

767
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,359
if I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're saying so</font>

768
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,430
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying I can see it's got a bit</font>

769
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,960
one critic see it won't be one prefix so

770
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,058
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a packet from these</font>

771
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,619
sorceries to the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes sir it</font>

772
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:27,299
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it should be mounted on but</font>

773
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,009
you deal with one source address using

774
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:31,109
the same source address but quick it's

775
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:33,089
from the host and packets to the host my

776
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:35,788
cannons through the different links so

777
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:38,400
only one source address<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one aliens</font>

778
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">two different links yes but in that case</font>

779
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,970
I mean they when you up so when you were

780
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,680
to apply that filtering to you know to

781
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:49,049
on this rather than it should allow them

782
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,640
on both wings it might be completely

783
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:56,640
different router<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere all right</font>

784
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,859
it's two different routers whoa fight

785
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,808
this is the stuff that I you'd apply at

786
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,759
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge so if you are talking about you</font>

787
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:05,609
know some random Rueter in the network

788
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:08,150
that's like a different scenario you're

it's a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea i'm not going to</font>

your PF it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking the net were in</font>

805
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,390
different yeah yeah yeah because bcp

806
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,400
scituate has nothing to do with

807
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,140
asymmetric origin but you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

808
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,700
does your PM doesn't work properly if

809
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,850
you have a symmetrical routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh-huh</font>

810
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,939
but bcp situated just says okay I know

811
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,860
that I should not receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> spec it from I</font>

812
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,870
should receive only sole source from the

<font color="#E5E5E5">clink it says nice and about where I</font>

814
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:15,790
route packets for those destinations

815
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I cannot imagine as I say like but</font>

816
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:21,100
if you can obvious from<font color="#CCCCCC"> his harder to</font>

817
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:24,220
imagine that but if you can complete

818
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,770
right program on which you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font>

819
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,209
38 work just fine but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't i</font>

820
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,190
mean i'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it i mean i might</font>

821
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,930
be wrong yeah the only comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna</font>

822
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,660
say is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really should stop talking</font>

823
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">about bcp 30 a call it anti spoofing</font>

824
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,250
there bc p84 that deals with the

825
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,140
asymmetric routing issue and actually

826
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,420
pekus<font color="#E5E5E5"> avila had written a draft that</font>

it where he had operation experience

with anti spoofing a lot bc p38 or

833
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:05,379
I I very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> also agree with Arik that</font>

834
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,569
I think this this might be problematic

835
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and really you know looking at all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds</font>

836
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,680
of error messages that may have

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,060
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad versus you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

what you might want to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

839
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,490
differently or filtering scares me but

840
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:23,920
but let's I think we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> take this</font>

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:39,009
r PF strip you should be fired you're

846
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,549
suggesting your PF strict essential I'm

847
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,230
saying all that this is not in which we

848
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,740
are thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying DC's on the</font>

849
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:51,160
edge so that's what is an edge

850
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,799
because an edge could be the guy one hop

851
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,560
up from a dsl modem or an edge could be

852
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,730
the guy one-half up from a ds3 connector

853
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,310
customer they're both edge case yeah

854
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,020
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you absolutely should be doing</font>

855
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,380
European strict and this will work

856
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:10,660
beautifully case to you do that oh my

857
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,700
god you're going to break things yeah

858
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,569
that's why your PF loose was created

859
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,100
uh-huh and what you're suggesting

860
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:22,540
doesn't work with your PF loosed oh well

861
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:24,940
actually what rules that we specified in

862
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:28,270
this document is exactly the same thing

863
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you find in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bc p38 just</font>

864
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,020
applying you know the featuring to a

865
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:38,529
different field the problem is it

866
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:40,990
doesn't work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way bcp yeah so ad</font>

867
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,430
here um the problem is it can't be

868
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,709
universally applied the way it's

869
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,210
described in bc p38 if it could be

870
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone would use it everywhere and</font>

871
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,080
things would be hunky-dory and this

872
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:53,799
would never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a problem but it can't be</font>

873
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,980
so it isn't and so everybody who says

874
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,470
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use bc p38 it's like that doesn't</font>

875
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">work if your transit customers are</font>

876
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:05,589
multihomed like even if they are edges

877
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,299
because they might withdraw prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

economic loss<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cody bling draw away so</font>

994
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:31,440
you have this is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer watch our</font>

995
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:31,440
router so my talk to each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

996
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:40,000
and as I install default route like this

997
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:42,970
at some point right one of them stole

998
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,059
the whole crowd like this one of them

999
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:48,730
host<font color="#E5E5E5"> once and break it here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1000
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:54,819
received I but this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz default here</font>

1001
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:56,910
so its hand like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end using can all</font>

1002
00:58:54,819 --> 00:59:01,320
hit

1003
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:21,740
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh no sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not look like this can</font>

1004
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:29,160
I throw it ah I yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly so h1</font>

1005
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:32,189
router1 age to internet we connected

1006
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:35,370
like this right this they have default

1007
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:38,300
pointing here today is this a backup

1008
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:42,540
they don't want normally use it yeah I

1009
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:46,110
get went like this right I think we

1010
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:48,509
reached this router sub-editor on packet

1011
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:51,270
reached this router somewhere the

1012
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:53,220
internet and because they have her<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1013
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:59,490
and qwali says they decided to send this

<font color="#CCCCCC">ICP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back here not true another link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1015
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:06,870
and your outer<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually receive it icmp</font>

1018
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:14,339
cost one here but in this case in this

1019
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,560
device since you're having these leaking

1020
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,330
here you shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> desert is</font>

1021
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you picture it's exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1023
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,780
have the things that you're putting here

1024
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:27,330
so in my picture their voter that is a

1025
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:30,810
plane III<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that this horse has a</font>

1026
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:32,190
single connection that's the basis on

1027
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:34,470
which you apply the featuring so for

1028
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:42,420
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> this second example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they say</font>

1029
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:45,660
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot assume you see that</font>

1030
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:47,880
you are losing one color and then

1031
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,980
suddenly your host get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good gets other</font>

1032
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,520
connection and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they have to</font>

1033
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,530
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you let me</font>

1034
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of a different scenario so let's</font>

1035
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're trying to suggest your</font>

1037
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:05,940
current one is very interesting scenario

1038
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:15,930
which is way to be caused by they cost

1039
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:18,420
issue let's say I believe user scenarios

1040
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:20,600
which is this might work but the number

1041
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those scenarios comparing to the</font>

1042
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:25,110
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Snyder's when it does not</font>

1043
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,240
apply and when it's dangerous are so

1044
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:31,070
high and risk is so low so I think we

1045
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">should concentrate on fixing stretch</font>

1046
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:40,030
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these firewalls like his</font>

1047
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,919
deep eyes who feel they looking for

1048
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:45,130
sessions the practice of my latest

1049

<font color="#E5E5E5">obsession it keep the dancer yeah uh-huh</font>

1050

1051

chamber<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what remaining so your</font>

1052
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:56,980
firewall which sits like yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

same<font color="#E5E5E5"> subnet that will protect you first</font>

1054
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:02,350
and has all this session table and looks

1055
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,540
at all these sequence numbers my

1056
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:07,060
channels its<font color="#CCCCCC"> top is used to book and</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the record oh I should probably</font>

1059
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:14,109
because it's the same weighs the same as

1060
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,180
resilient as if equated with love me too

1062
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:22,240
eyepiece much right it's your hard work

1063
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:25,690
stateful firewall my duty stuff but nice

1064
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:28,810
away nicely relatable it's a firewall a

1065
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:30,460
stateless fire will stay prepared no no

1066
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:32,680
I'm saying a stateless firewall

1067
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:34,840
connected to the same subnet you could

1068
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,540
apply this even if you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1069
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:42,250
to go for the margin stable now because

1070
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:44,440
it's soup again it's very particular

1071
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:46,180
saliva in the mouth of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

1072
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,170
night and all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kit even for stateful</font>

1073
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:52,540
firewall remember people normally do

1074
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:55,360
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this cost and resynchronization</font>

1075
01:02:52,540 --> 01:03:00,640
to make sure I Sinatra<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colorado rick is</font>

1076
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:03,040
good for example and let's say we have

1077
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,339
this costing here right and let's say

1078
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:12,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this horse has you know two routers</font>

1079
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:14,980
in here right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now as if the host has a</font>

1080
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:22,089
single let's see that this one is doing

1081
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:24,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">ECB Syria yeah basically change</font>

1082
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,260
basically started click configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

1083
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:27,069
that i have this tablet and Rosie sling

1084
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,440
and

1085
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:41,410
only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sectionals prefixes let's see</font>

1086
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:44,170
what I were you let's say is very easy

1087
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:47,469
to apply I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> thankful but it's very</font>

1088
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:49,449
hard to apply on as soon as you have fun

1089
01:03:47,469 --> 01:03:51,489
if your transit providers who I will

1090
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:53,319
never manage to get to a university what

1091
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:55,630
if because this is something i don't

1092
01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if i don't think this is flag as</font>

1093
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:02,170
bcp surya but i have seen this done they

1094
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:06,999
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this let's say that we</font>

1095
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:10,779
have let's say I mean 9268 / let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1096
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:15,459
16 right now I have this connection yeah

1097
01:04:10,779 --> 01:04:19,690
and let's say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this water now has a</font>

1098
01:04:15,459 --> 01:04:24,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">packing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming from this address</font>

1099
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:25,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know i miss booking filter yes but in</font>

1100
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,910
this there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases in which they drop</font>

1101
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:30,849
these pockets because they say well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1102
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:33,549
think you ate only normally wins and all

1103
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:35,920
that because well so what I'm saying is

1104
01:04:33,549 --> 01:04:37,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm saying</font>

1105
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,699
you're different because if you look how

1106
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:45,160
out enclose completely different because

1107
01:04:41,699 --> 01:04:47,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is no scenario grandma this packet</font>

1108
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,899
should come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 I mean what if you</font>

1109
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:52,359
have another link let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1110
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:54,309
have a neighbor here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ursula Lincoln</font>

1111
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:56,529
comes this work yes by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1112
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:58,509
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they never and normally they don't</font>

1113
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:00,880
drop it like if there is enough another

1114
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:04,599
network here they do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the like</font>

1115
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:06,400
internet and and how does them make it

1116
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:08,019
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink I wish I give you a scenario</font>

1117
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">and referential yeah but it's completely</font>

1118
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:13,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">different scenario that's why we do this</font>

1119
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:15,880
but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> never do this because but</font>

1120
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:17,229
when sin is that in this case I'm not

1121
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that it's exactly the same thing</font>

1122
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you have a scenario where in Europe</font>

1123
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:23,170
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply this filter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II and then the</font>

1124
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,930
horse is motive home you're breaking the

1125
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,999
network I have a neighbor here with

1126
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">chillings now I'm sending the packet and</font>

1127
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:32,140
for routine reasons it ends up coming

1128
01:05:30,339 --> 01:05:35,980
this way you drop the packet when you

1129
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:39,160
shouldn't you wanna me

1130
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:41,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay let me think of how I shall draw</font>

1131
