this thing yes there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a revision</font>

50
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:03,949
that a provision is of editorial nature

<font color="#E5E5E5">steak head Tori changes but they are</font>

52
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:11,840
editorial oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay however on top of that</font>

53
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:15,650
through some discussion in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IMT see</font>

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,199
which trickled back to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on but</font>

55
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,199
more mostly we came up with one other

56
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:25,940
change that's potentially not editorial

57
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:30,680
and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with this decoding</font>

58
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:36,199
order number presence being signaled

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,539
through the trend through the mode of it

60
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:44,810
through the transmission mode Mrs T srst

61
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:48,380
and mr empty it may be worth to be

62
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,940
couple this coupling and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have a</font>

63
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,300
proposal doing

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,460
that in the very near future okay and

65
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,530
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an editorial change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

66
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,299
guess until you have to come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

67
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,099
word you look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first one to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group with us okay hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

69
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:11,720
present our estimation is that it will

70
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,430
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I wouldn't tell you most of</font>

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would probably not even seen it</font>

72
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,790
because the changes are really really

73
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,470
really minor and eligible but it's still

74
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,900
a non editorial change the world come

75
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:27,560
back but it's not going to be there's

76
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,140
not going to be a need for foreign you

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,180
know to review<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the whatever 90 pages</font>

78
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,370

82
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,989

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:46,900
map codec it's a M LP and there's an

148
00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:06,340
it's being used it was submitted the

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:15,450
draft was submitted in previous versions

150
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:21,850
of this now it has it has 3 mods this

152
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:30,820
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that important now as I read</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but has anyone else read this</font>

155
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:43,480
have some I sentiment a response on the

156
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:47,620
list on some of these like they have

157
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:52,450
they the thing is that the right thing

158
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:55,570
is that first of all that they expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

159
00:10:52,450 --> 00:11:01,750
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> symmetrical on both sides so if you</font>

160
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:03,310
offer 12 to 2 2400 600 and 1200 it means

161
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can dynamically switch between</font>

162
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,790
them

163
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,240
the preferred one is the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and</font>

164
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:14,230
the response the the the offer and the

165
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,050
response can select what he wants and

166
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:21,640
he's dictate the order and it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

167
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:23,319
be symmetric it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I didn't</font>

168
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask why I mean that's the way it's used</font>

169
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay they want it to be symmetric so I</font>

170
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,380
didn't care it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

171
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:40,420
can ask why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's need to be symmetric</font>

172
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:42,760
and inside an RTP it<font color="#E5E5E5"> cited it in an RTP</font>

173
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,709
packet that can be multiple friends but

174
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,200
they need all of them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this from</font>

175
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rate you cannot switch</font>

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,670
dynamically inside an RTP packets that's

177
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:58,090
the way it's got its build the other

178
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:03,729
things there<font color="#CCCCCC"> too to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> note is that they</font>

179
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:08,020
are requesting to have the payload

180
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:12,040
subtype name will be they have em ELP

181
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:14,829
and ELP<font color="#CCCCCC"> e and they have also ones that</font>

182
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,040
are with the beach right inside like the

183
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,440
1200 the 600 and I said we don't usually

184
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,240
like it because we prefer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advocate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

185
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">a parameter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which they're having the</font>

186
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,830
definition but they said it's already

187
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,510
being used currently so they want just

188
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture the weight is being used</font>

189
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:37,180
instead of of changing look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it send</font>

190
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:39,730
the comment whatever to do is this since

191
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,370
it's a it's a it's a regular audio codec

192
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:47,740
payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification will ask for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

193
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:49,780
milestone for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the adoption and try to to</font>

194
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:59,670
work would be so that's the plan for

195
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that any comment of that Jonathan</font>

196
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,779
Jonathan I Simon have a little scared

197
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,009
this unity we asked yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

198
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,560
stamping they've already done rather

199
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:15,589
than applying our best practices to how

200
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,369
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it should be done so hopefully</font>

201
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:22,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean if they are they'll be unhappy if</font>

202
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,480
we change how it works then I don't

203
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,250
think that'll be a bit outcome for

204
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,360
anyone so I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean</font>

205
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,949
what way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were saying is like you</font>

206
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a foundation or does this</font>

207
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">way so we can't change that I think they</font>

208
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,939
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only point it's about think the</font>

209
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,430
only point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the payload subtype</font>

210
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,469
limbs and we can discuss this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I'm</font>

211
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">just saying what I got i sent a comment</font>

212
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,000
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I it's on the mailing list we</font>

213
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,850
sent a comment we got a response we can

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,399
still discuss this but I mean at least

215
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,290
it's a lot it's an RTP payload for an

216
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,149
audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> codec search we save this scope of</font>

217
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,579
this working group and that's what we

218
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,800
are doing it so that's a problem the

219
00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:00,258
issue is whether we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress it</font>

220
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aziza we wanted to make changes and that</font>

221
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:13,790
they'll have to make a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

222
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay so so it will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sent</font>

223
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,259
also in this on the mailing list and

224
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:21,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll take into consideration before</font>

225
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,819
adopt adopting it as a as a work item in

226
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,229
the working good to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

227
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:26,120
okay with essential we have some

228
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:32,059
agreement about how to proceed on that

229
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:36,439
part okay okay so think this is the this

230
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:42,639
is the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one okay</font>

231
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:42,639
so the next presentation we have is the

232
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,979
the SF this one the theory search

233
00:14:51,670 --> 00:15:03,650
note i'll present from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> powerpoint</font>

234
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:17,330
like you asked so i could maybe be well

235
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:19,069
there's a flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> fax sorry the</font>

236
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">conclusion for the Prince feran station</font>

237
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,900
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will first let some ppl response</font>

238
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,070
on the list on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it's constructed</font>

239
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,630
and they have any concerns about it and

240
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,900
then after we finish that we can go to

241
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step of having a milestone just</font>

242
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,340
to be sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are flexible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

243
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,800
accepting that if you bring it here

244
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,410
chain it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they may need to do</font>

245
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,449
some changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how flexibilities yes</font>

246
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,189
yeah just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remark sure I keep</font>

247
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,540
trying to just me remind you you know

248
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,660
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> highly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> charged on</font>

249
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,150
specification requires I mean they could

250
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another body get specified and</font>

251
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,930
then you effectively be asked to rubber

252
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,780
stamping so of course what I'm saying is

253
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,239
don't apply your criteria to<font color="#CCCCCC"> rush if it</font>

254
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,920
does harm and obviously confine yeah but

255
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,260
but at least I wanted to have some I

256
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,270
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> some little discussion before we go</font>

257
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,340
to the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step and if some people are</font>

258
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,400
concerned I already said look at what

259
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,490
the current exchange it was on the list

260
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,560
and if you're if you have more concerns

261
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:28,730
than we can try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and then we can</font>

262
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:37,459
progress that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so discuss Cynthia</font>

263
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:39,800
t91 ancillary data in RTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so simply</font>

264
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,840
what is this society of motion picture

265
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,120
and television engineers it's the

266
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,370
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> development organization for</font>

professional video applications and

268
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,600
today professional video inside the

269
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,450
broadcast plant is carrying something

270
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,300
called a serial digital interface or SDI

271
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,660
this is either

272
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a megabit per second for SD or 1.48</font>

coaxial cables when these technologies

276
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,020
were developed in 1990s they were very

277
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,630
exciting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are pushing the edges</font>

278
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,420
of technology at the time today when we

282
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,920
in order to do this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to start</font>

442
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:26,149
to you know put this to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:42,330

comments on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

446
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:53,220
hmm I said it did anyone read it or have

00:25:46,710 --> 00:26:03,840
any comments on that ok you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready Colin</font>

these days people are using it in I you

454

whether it's you can have my directional

476
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,120
figured we keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the dose all</font>

he'll welcome to be constant right yes

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:29,919
so there's the usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> complexity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

taking a look at how you use rtcp sender

probably also want to have some sort of

I think you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> good things go together</font>

510
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:46,689
yeah yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get we particular cat box</font>

necessarily ruling out the use of the

that has a 64-bit time staying up an

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:22,330
this setup yes sir I absolutely think we

521
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:24,669
should do do this looking the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

notice you've copied the extended

sequence number thing from 4175 please

524
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:34,240
for 4175 that's needed because the

525
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,860
secrets numbers were out too quickly it

526
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,100
wasn't clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me if you had enough</font>

packets in this format that you actually

528
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,309
needed the extended series number

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:45,490
to make things easier because it's the

something to perhaps look at the other

for these types of applications and the

541
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:17,200
video that the counters wrap very

about that I figured it's hard to go

558
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,160
along with it because we don't know

exactly how much ancillary data people

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,510
article formats and what media types do

570
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:33,510
they use speaking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself I think we</font>

571
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:36,240
have had some which typically have any

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,900
milk really like fat will use typically

573
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,400
use video for protecting video I'm not

<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have meditative proper as</font>

575
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,170
opposed to a pair of clothes and there's

576
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,540
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know cursor position uses video</font>

577
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,690
things like that so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> their arses</font>

578
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,639
so precedent for this it could also be

<font color="#E5E5E5">application but I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

586
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:18,260
think we used video for the 3gpp time

text which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of reverse closed</font>

588
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,400

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,540
against<font color="#CCCCCC"> HQ for it so politically because</font>

599
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,180

600
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that well and then what reason</font>

601
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,990
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to mix and match for</font>

602
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,300
instance if we have an English version

603
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a German version or french version of</font>

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,140
of different distributions of this

606
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,179
device Cable will pull the RTP German

607
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,790
over here with this video and then pull

608
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,340
the French for that videos I think the

609
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,510
flexibility makes it reasonable that we

610
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,919
have these and separate our community

611
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,020
sessions this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really to be bundled</font>

612
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,690
together for end users this is for

613
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,780
production so it's more because

614
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:31,640
basically thank you then application is

615
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:35,660
not the problem it's the old full story

have this type of vanilla burger if I

had 10 you basically just said about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

623
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,710
you know some way of indicating which

closed captions are written which in

625

mind there's the outside available list

631
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,589
over time we may as an indicator

broadcast industry we may want to take a

633
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:26,199
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at breaking the closed captions out</font>

634
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:28,310
the separate time text streams

635
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,868
unfortunately we're not at a point where

636
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,659
we can really do that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still too</font>

much legacy built around is 608 the 708

641
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,609
now but if you've been mentioning the

642
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,409
use case of identifying springs by

643
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:51,799
different language or closed captioning

644
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:55,909
by different language there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a kind of</font>

645
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:00,020
pre buff effort going on right now and

646
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:02,599
ryone which includes doing some language

647
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:05,119
tagging for our TV screens it's really

648
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,700
more designed for interactive telephony

649
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,290
type in fact applications but there may

650
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,879
be some applicability here at least when

651
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,500
it comes to how you identify these

652
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,180
things just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to keep in mind</font>

653
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah that's that's great</font>

654
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,730
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> what one can ways you have a</font>

655
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,380
closed caption we are very strict the

656
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulations are very certain of course</font>

657
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:27,740
by the FCC now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly will be</font>

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,330
enforced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by telecommunication regulators</font>

659
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,330
around the world so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have to be</font>

660
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:35,089
careful about exactly what you know how

661
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,640
power carrying labeling these things but

662
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,509
I people<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to watch that</font>

663
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,180
sometimes I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hooked up to a price</font>

account controller

666
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:50,369
does reciprocation so we have precedent

667
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:56,359
graphic application<font color="#CCCCCC"> mimetypes for so we</font>

668
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:56,359
have video it's a phone camera control

669
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:15,049
while 224 has something to do with video

670
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,420
in the sense that it controls the camera

671
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">224 is something that goes from the</font>

672
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">receiving end to the sending end only so</font>

673
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:28,109
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a totally legitimate use to control</font>

674
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:30,150
the camera promises it took you to use

675
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:32,578
to 24 to send camera control information

676
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,220
from a system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never seen a</font>

677
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,599
camera in its life right so I think

678
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,910
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a difference because this stuff</font>

679
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,670
is really clearly basically as I was

680
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,020
here it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just too it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to say</font>

681
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,500
that there's there's a there's a

682
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,660
tailored format RTP payload which is the

683
00:36:46,500 --> 00:37:04,650
application that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's oh</font>

684
00:36:48,660 --> 00:37:07,770
there's one already I think because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

685
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,119
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting it's not just</font>

686
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,609
metadata is that I made an actually has

687
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,130
some notion of where it is inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

688
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:16,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">cover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video frame so it's my penis it's</font>

689
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,329
certainly an odd video format but you

690
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:21,980
know it is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sense it goes inside</font>

691
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:25,890
you know the you know the whatever the

692
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:30,180
bsci yeah so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some sense video in</font>

693
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:32,650
essence on competence I've moves that we

694
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,740
agree that this interest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work</font>

695
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:39,380
okay okay so i can see there's there's

696
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,500
interest in this work and it's in line

697
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,750
with what we are doing so will<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can ask</font>

698
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,530
if people thinks that it's for the

699
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,810
working group to work on that who agrees

700
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,080
that we should work on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> say in this</font>

701
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:56,779
working group should raise their hand

702
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:00,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay anyone objecting to that should</font>

703
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,450
raise their end ok so we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

704
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,970
list of tool to get the approval on that

705
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:11,390
and then we will continue with this with

706
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:12,890
the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah we will need</font>

707
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:19,220
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a milestone on that after that</font>

708
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:26,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so no you got the action item ok so</font>

709
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:30,279
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll ask you to are</font>

710
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you going to leave some time also for</font>

711
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:51,110
because otherwise Justin would be will

712
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:53,870
not like it so go to this one on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

713
00:38:51,110 --> 00:39:02,660
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine perhaps because</font>

714
00:38:53,870 --> 00:39:05,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe next time this so just I uploaded</font>

715
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:09,080
the new revision about half an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

716
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,540
so we love raffle now so if you had

717
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,540
earlier then you should try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

718
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:19,859
again at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side just ok you sorry yes</font>

719
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:23,038
sir the exception is looking document

720
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:25,410
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just submitted 00</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Asian we got</font>

721
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:29,880
some comments from Magnus thank you

722
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:31,288
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those comments soon so</font>

723
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,109
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of poppin issues that</font>

724
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:37,349
have been carried<font color="#E5E5E5"> over from Honolulu the</font>

725
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,759
first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> was how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be associated the</font>

726
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:42,930
repair package<font color="#CCCCCC"> streams to the source</font>

727
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">packaging screams and this I think in</font>

728
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:49,288
Honolulu with the music<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no</font>

729
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,210
final decision so since it's called flex

730
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:53,849
back we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that we would go with</font>

731
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:57,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic Association would be armed</font>

732
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:59,880
and keep the stb very simple thus we

733
00:39:57,779 --> 00:40:04,920
won't have a good music again<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps</font>

734
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,779
just htp<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct rate can vary over so so</font>

735
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,230
there's no association in stp we just

736
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:13,920
declare them in as the example shows at

737
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bottom I think one question to ask</font>

738
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,700
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the people are happy with</font>

739
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:26,578
this step if not doing any another

740
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:31,470
payload type or<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC declaration yeah</font>

741
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide place then so so the</font>

742
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,839
current problem is perhaps as simple as

743
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:38,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have effect RTP stream and you</font>

744
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,910
have source streams from different media

745
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,859
sources so you want me to even<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

746
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:48,279
have to cram when the receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> received</font>

747
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:50,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">it there is no actual actually currently</font>

748
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,610
way of associating them so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

749
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:56,290
several ways we can do this they're

750
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,240
exemplified in the next couple of slides

751
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:01,720
also thanks to Peter Thatcher who make

752
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,680
these slides than the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> four in</font>

753
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Senegal next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please so left for</font>

754
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:13,690
bias SRC which is basically putting and

755
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's SRC in the effect stream</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in same</font>

756
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to certain source</font>

757
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:24,089
RTP stream them that's as simple as

758
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:28,689
protection in having severe<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stupid</font>

759
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:31,290
media source<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next time the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

760
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,910
was hard to fit using em ideally powered

761
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:36,190
how would we do this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

762
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,779
difficult especially if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there</font>

763
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,750
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple sources of our TV screens</font>

764
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,360
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media source so so their work a</font>

765
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,640
1 a 2 then made a would not work but if

766
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,950
there was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single week via source</font>

767
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,279
like just read a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 then this will be</font>

768
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:54,310
easy and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sufficient next</font>

769
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:59,140
slide so there's also proposal of doing

770
00:41:54,310 --> 00:42:01,360
an RTP source ID where it would be as

771
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,960
simple as adding another identifier to

772
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,030
to both the source cream and the repair

773
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,730
stream where both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have the</font>

774
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,309
identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and you would be able to</font>

775
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive</font>

776
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:15,949
when you receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will be able</font>

777
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:18,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">to map them next slide so something like</font>

778
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:21,650
this you could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without the msid</font>

779
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:26,359
just RS<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by itself so in this case</font>

780
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:30,739
you say to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and before and this is</font>

781
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:34,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">another way of signaling this so I guess</font>

782
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:36,709
the question next I play the pic so this

783
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:39,619
would look like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the article hair</font>

784
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:41,089
extensions as unexciting one for the

785
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:43,910
sauce streams which would be on every

786
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:45,170
packet and the facts teamwork whenever

787
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,759
the practical drive would have the same

788
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,949
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be able to associate this</font>

789
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:54,199
game if you are multiple streams the

790
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:56,479
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are correct so so i guess</font>

791
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:59,689
the open question for this first issue

792
00:42:56,479 --> 00:43:03,529
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which of the three mechanisms or four</font>

793
00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:12,618
mechanisms are ideal of just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC</font>

794
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:15,140
using made<font color="#CCCCCC"> + RS ID or just RS ID i think</font>

795
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:18,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doing s Circe's explicitly as a</font>

796
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:21,319
developer a terrible idea because I mean

797
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:24,399
all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that expected all</font>

798
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:24,400
the recording stuff

799
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:31,630
and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of scope</font>

800
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">whispered and additionally I think we</font>

801
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,470
also need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this problem for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

802
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">TX which isn't already defined feel a</font>

803
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,649
little workout so whatever we do should

804
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:42,730
be better extensions or other<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

805
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">data so i think that we should say we're</font>

806
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,570
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us our seeds and we should</font>

807
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:52,180
further rescue worker with scope which

808
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:57,940
is either injector didn't lose his job

809
00:43:52,180 --> 00:44:00,430
to EDX know this is an easy like the

810
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,520
flexpay itself let's go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but but</font>

811
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:06,759
I you associate both<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect & RPX with</font>

812
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,910
source dreams so the other side equals

813
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,040
ours ID or something like that yeah so

814
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:15,270
either I'm using gravity exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

815
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,270
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bed little social creatures</font>

816
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:21,130
Colin Perkins I i think i got up stick

817
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,399
something very similar I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

818
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:28,120
SSRC works of a sudden you need a

819
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,730
separate suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier to do this I</font>

820
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,819
would suggest that probably the right

821
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:36,010
way to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in which could be</font>

822
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:42,790
would be signaled an sdp or was in other

823
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:44,620
extensions like this so basically you

824
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,650
want to generic mechanisms firm saying

825
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:53,589
these streams get together which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

826
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:55,510
if you see specific the other side Eve

827
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:59,620
would be we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to worry about</font>

828
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:02,770
maybe mid already has a different

829
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:06,100
purpose you use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its existing</font>

830
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:09,450
focus if you need another end<font color="#CCCCCC"> into Earth</font>

831
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,450
to signal best that you can

832
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:17,690
okay they say so filter point I'd

833
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,790
make is that finishing that doesn't mean

834
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:22,040
to block this draft is this product

835
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,750
would work fine they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> wiggle our</font>

839
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,690

843
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,950
that what I understand is I think what

844
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:54,380
Jonathan and I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> John Kahn is</font>

845
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,359
that you have a solution when it's in a

846
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,080
separate this one is if you want to to

847
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,020
have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> m line or also you</font>

848
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,460
need maybe in the case where you have

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:16,009
identifiers for that then in this case

853
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:18,710
you need to the other side I think

854
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:23,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">people agree or did the RSI do some some</font>

855
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:25,070
generic token is needed but I think it

856
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:28,910
needs to be presented in their music

857
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:31,910
right does okay that it's not to pay it

858
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,649
sets at a payload okay then you just you

859
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,230
will have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is an example that you</font>

860
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,540
have to define the generic this generic

861
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:51,500
one in a different working groups 0

862
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:54,590
through that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conclusion yeah just to</font>

863
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:57,050
find this viable but you have a solution

864
00:46:54,590 --> 00:47:02,300
that's currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> working using the the</font>

865
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:04,250
separate headline yeah contact as a

866
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:09,140
procedural thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this go quickly</font>

867
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would write this payload format just</font>

868
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,500
on the assumption that everything is

869
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,450
sense of separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Airlines and you use</font>

870
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,780
the grouping

871
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:18,730
that way this can be done very quickly I

872
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,070
would then in another working group do

873
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,170
this other stuff and then that draft

874
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,210
then refer to this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> r-tx</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and anything</font>

875
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,750
else where it useful I'm waiting UT

876
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:31,119
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and so that would you you're</font>

877
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:34,030
going to read no it's just a separate

878
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,190
thing which says you this could be used

879
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:40,599
for example but it would normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

880
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,430
you don't need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you just see</font>

881
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,230
you say when you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with that that's</font>

882
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,180
how you use it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other draft okay</font>

883
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,890
yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you do this because they</font>

884
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,868
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft could be defining in generic</font>

885
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,000
mechanism make it say go for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

886
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:54,280
could use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ya transmission you</font>

887
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,359
could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with a flexible fat etc etc</font>

888
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,520
etc grouper this graph says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

889
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:02,828
use as a proving framework or any other

00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,990
mechanism for associating sorcery with

891
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:13,650
American citizens drop defined in the

892
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:15,939
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so we have such a drop</font>

893
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:18,280
whoever you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

894
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:21,250
begins is right because perhaps you

895
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,010
don't have been two more cycles<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

896
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">can help it was this one who to do that</font>

897
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:31,560
that's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there are a</font>

898
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:35,230
couple of other open issues which were I

899
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:39,578
think simple to solve the first one is

900
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:42,250
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm which are in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rdp headers</font>

901
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:44,290
or in the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> our DB others and</font>

902
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:47,500
basically n equal to 0 and in equal to

903
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:50,109
one book mean that's a row back we

904
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:53,589
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just overload this the</font>

905
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:55,150
slightly by saying that if you want to

906
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:55,820
just send row fact then you said it as

907
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,530
any

908
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,330
20 and if you think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

909
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,700
send both<font color="#CCCCCC"> raw and contracting set this</font>

910
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:07,080
as n equal to 1 so that the receiver<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

911
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:09,149
an idea that with n equal to 0 when it

912
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,430
receives the packet that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

913
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,230
of the row and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does happen wait for</font>

914
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:14,940
more packets and maybe send a

915
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:18,480
retransmission packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more than one</font>

916
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:22,680
package missing with n equal to 1 it

917
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,930
knows that that it would anticipate more

918
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,319
back packets will be coming which would

919
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:33,049
be callin fact and therefore be able to

920
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:38,670
repair like worst loss of packet so I

921
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:40,950
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is is it ok because I</font>

922
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:46,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">think last time when we would discuss</font>

923
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:47,939
this we had second bullet and now we

924
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to just sufficiently slightly</font>

925
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:55,910
optimized for a case where we good we

926
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:58,799
good guess if the if there's a loss then

927
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it recoverable or not with the</font>

928
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,520
anticipation of more effect packets to

929
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:07,650
come mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just understand spawn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

930
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">they well the other changes I think you</font>

931
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:12,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to point out later is that there's a</font>

932
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,660
used to be SDP level description of

933
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:18,620
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this was 1d or 2d one day</font>

934
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:21,720
in early 2d or whatnot interleaved and

935
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:24,569
this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowing dynamic in</font>

936
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,890
RTP description of that so again we're

937
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,510
trying to divorce ourselves of anything

938
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,670
in stp will try to make everything

939
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:32,700
flexible and dynamic at the sender's

940
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:36,300
discretion in RTP and so by doing this

941
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:39,419
we can eliminate the stp part and and

942
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,670
the RTP sender can dynamically signal

943
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,600
whether or not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> D is coming here's one</font>

944
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">D but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to D is coming</font>

945
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:57,440
actually like most motivation because if

946
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,209
your instance in one of the cases that

947
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,580
definitely care about is if you're

948
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,710
applying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact to video and video</font>

949
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,480
bandwidth and swing around so widely you

950
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,400
want to be dynamically changing your

951
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,500
structure you know like depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

952
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:15,830
whether it's decided to 76 megabits or

953
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:19,330
50 kilobits<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so I understand</font>

954
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:24,529
people agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this proposal anyone</font>

955
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:28,700
objecting to this proposal so so okay so

956
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:30,950
I i think that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have</font>

957
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,879
couple of operations based basically

958
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:36,529
with this in SD be the first ones the

959
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,030
type of protections if you go with the

960
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:43,700
flexible one that we could do away with

961
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:45,260
this top pitch which was 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 to</font>

962
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,080
indicate that it's interleaved<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

963
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,910
interviewed and and or both if you do it

964
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:53,360
dynamically in RTP that there is less

965
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:55,370
use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist in stp however i</font>

966
00:51:53,360 --> 00:52:00,650
believe there might be some cases where

967
00:51:55,370 --> 00:52:04,549
it may not they might be static so if

968
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:06,700
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it is nice to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font>

969
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:09,890
you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is remove it but</font>

970
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:14,720
you open to suggestion if you should

971
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:19,430
keep it or not so any feedback on that

972
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:21,689
if if not we will remove it

973
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:26,850
that means there anything picture that

974
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:30,120
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if you were to negotiate</font>

975
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:32,759
that that's a question amazing not gonna

976
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,410
basically taking out as to be movable in

977
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,820
negotiating whatever the sender wants to

978
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,819
do is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> senator wants to do but</font>

979
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,290
leaving knobs like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stp</font>

980
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,750
encourage people to do modes and then

981
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:51,029
get being flexible and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

982
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:53,370
personally just try to bake it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you</font>

983
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:57,450
can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the stp cold so just</font>

984
00:52:53,370 --> 00:53:01,350
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well so the last open</font>

985
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:03,419
issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nds TV this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is again the length</font>

986
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:06,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the depth of the the fixed 2d</font>

987
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,930
protection the main point was that

988
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:15,140
conveyed the M&N we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only go to 56</font>

989
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:17,940
cross 256 packets which is quite many so

990
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:20,819
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove it and be happy and just</font>

991
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,940
look at the constraint that that one

992
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:27,450
comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a predominately 56 well</font>

993
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,670
actually you say that it's too is 250 cc

994
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,259
is too large but actually for high

995
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,650
bitrate applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not really</font>

996
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that much I mean if you consider</font>

997
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:50,400
uncompressed video for example 256

998
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:52,799
package is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in terror yeah so I mean</font>

999
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,670
I think that if we need fact for

1000
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,490
identity

1001
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:58,920
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a modified primitive</font>

1002
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:01,020
as easily spent a sequence on the family

1003
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,700
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know if you're not</font>

1004
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,799
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you forgive this attentive use case</font>

1005
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,180
of this is for things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use or dressing</font>

1006
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,069
team can see those numbers i think that

1007
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:11,009
you know being able to protect no more

1008
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:16,529
than entire signals number roll over is

1009
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:19,140
entirely fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also it it's</font>

1010
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:21,420
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the hackett rated the</font>

1011
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,700
original videos that length of the

1012
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:27,750
protection period you need speed box go

1013
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:29,368
by the way so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending even</font>

1014
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:33,990
with uncompressed video you might not

1015
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:36,990
need more than this so so the proposal

1016
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:41,729
is to remove it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm here no objection to</font>

1017
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:45,540
its ok let's remove it monks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1018
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:47,220
next steps it just gotta accept it as a

1019
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,099
working group document that some work

1020
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,649
still to be done we would appreciate

1021
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:54,680
feedback especially interviews so that

1022
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:59,549
we can fix this<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly going forward</font>

1023
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:01,609
perhaps be done with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so you</font>

1024
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:03,930
need to revise pressed of all the

1025
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:07,109
decision that was made here and then we

1026
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to see how to continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and finish is</font>

1027
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:11,880
that if there are no comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1028
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,549
we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the about the thing</font>

1029
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,210
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think like what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> colin</font>

1030
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:23,369
suggested that you should just use the

1031
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:28,339
to make it simpler yeah yeah yeah so we

1032
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:28,339
can be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

1033
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:46,960
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one we have a couple of</font>

1034
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:50,890
more minutes for Justin<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> craft</font>

1035
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:54,700
with the poultry video<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonathan gaining</font>

1036
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:57,460
a video on Big John Taylor format so if

1037
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,410
you cannot click overview much better

1038
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,480

1042
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight reference pictures in each</font>

1043
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,380
reference picture can be a different

1044
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,720
resolution than the frame that's

1045
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,760
actually being encoded does off sampling

1046
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,799
or down seven or whatever to basically

1047
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,180
go from the previous frame reference

1048
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,820
frame to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their for picture and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1049
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:25,240
allows or basically scalability that you

1050
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:29,200
can have a current picture at 720p be

1051
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:31,479
predicted from a base layer at 360p and

1052
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,640
you know that frame that should be cut

1053
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,650
it either from the base layer and a

1054
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,900
spatial sense that also from previous

1055
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:40,270
temporal frame and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty good for</font>

1056
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:48,000
multiple reference pictures and with

1057
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:51,009
this sorry and so with this we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1058
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,660
full scalability and dad one of things

1059
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,370
that comes along with this is that if

1060
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,460
we're basically supporting star sending

1061
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,990
a stream a middle box that's aware of

1062
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:01,840
scalability can basically drop out

1063
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:03,279
higher layers in these higher layers can

1064
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,870
be removed without affecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1065
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:09,760
integrity of the lower layer next slide

1066
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:12,460
so we introduce some terminology into in

1067
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,470
this document basically defining two

1068
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:17,470
types of things a superframe and a layer

1069
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:21,129
frame and the superframe our mayor fraim

1070
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:24,939
is this is saying for a given you know

1071
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">special size this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is base one street one</font>

1072
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,020
frame captured once<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a time and the</font>

1073
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:32,109
superframe is the combo this across all

1074
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:33,400
spatial layers so this basically just

1075
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:35,920
makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to refer to much other</font>

1076
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:39,220
concepts it's referred to frequently in

1077
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,690
the document next time so the

1078
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,540
packetization covers a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

1079
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,250
one things we need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is if</font>

1080
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,440
is a frame<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually something you know</font>

1081
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,450
what layer is it in but especially in

1082
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,190
temporarily what's this prediction

1083
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,410
structure or we're coming from is this

1084
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:56,020
thing discardable much the bits that are

1085
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:59,589
talked about in one of the presentations

1086
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:01,630
yesterday about basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> having frame</font>

1087
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:04,540
markings in RTP header extension are

1088
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,910
also sir presence here you know it

1089
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,680
indicates winners of packets the start

1090
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:10,870
of the frame packets at the end of a

1091
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,569
frame whether it's a keyframe whether

1092
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:16,240
the frame is<font color="#E5E5E5"> discarded and in addition</font>

1093
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,950
it also has other sort of things about

1094
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:23,770
you know take a temporal and spatial

1095
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:25,839
scalability<font color="#E5E5E5"> um there is there are two</font>

1096
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,150
modes of how the scalability can be

1097
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,340
indicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can either say here are</font>

1098
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:33,310
all the pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this particular</font>

1099
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,180
frame depends on or you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say</font>

1100
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:38,230
well there's a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre de there</font>

1101
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,790
there's gonna be a special pattern that

1102
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,560
these frames are going to follow for

1103
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,779
temporal structure you might say I'm

1104
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send temporal layer 0 first and</font>

1105
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,250
then two and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and two and always</font>

1106
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,410
moving the structure and so based on the

1107
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,660
actual sort of frame number you can

1108
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out kind of basically implicitly</font>

1109
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:56,350
determine what temporal reference

1110
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,830
pictures are going to be used and that

1111
00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:01,360
makes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's much redundancy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in each</font>

1112
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:03,940
specific packet and that makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1113
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,170
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient one of the other</font>

1114
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that receivers always need to</font>

1115
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,350
know is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when a picture</font>

1116
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,120
comes in they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the basin layer</font>

1117
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">first and then I could be enhancement</font>

1118
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:15,040
layer but if the code needs no do i omit

1119
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,870
the picture as soon as the bass players

1120
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,390
complete or do I wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the layers</font>

1121
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:21,310
to be present<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we have this thing</font>

1122
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:24,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the scalability structure that</font>

1123
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,570
sent early<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the stream we basically</font>

1124
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:27,580
know how many layers are currently being

1125
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,800
transmitted and if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

1126
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a base in an enhanced</font>

1127
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,280
you know that if you're only decoding

1128
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,140
the base so far you need to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

1129
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,340
enhancement to also come in before you

1130
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically admit the picture from the</font>

1131
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:43,800
decoder can it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed yes okay I'm</font>

1132
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible versus</font>

1133
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:49,050
not flexible mode the non flexible mode

1134
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you send the structure we</font>

1135
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:52,200
thought group of frames and in this

1136
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:55,680
thing basically sending here are the

1137
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,750
dependency orders this first up is

1138
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,000
specified the scalability structure and

1139
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,390
then you can refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this with a more</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and allows you to determine which are</font>

1142
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:07,980
there actual temporal references you're

1143
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,259
flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode you can actually basically</font>

1144
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,750
say here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> three excesses of reference</font>

1145
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,940
pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this thing depends upon</font>

1146
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:16,890
and it's more flexible as the name

1147
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,600
implies but it's also slightly more

1148
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:21,779
verbose in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many bits</font>

1149
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,279
requires the packetization header so

1150
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,870
here's the overall big picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

only fill in later 04 special

on overall I'd you know this can be good

01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:04,450
fairly efficiently you know in you don't

early on the stream you would send this

basically indicating here stuff that's

1212
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:07,870
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we went up to figure out</font>

1213
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:10,810
kind of how we have this preset

1214

structure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gotham neck stuff with</font>

like out because that hasn't

01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,150
explicit E&P feel as opposed to my

1217
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:20,060
heavily implicit from like the cough

1218
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:22,220
structure but yet a spit<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the s</font>

1219
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:24,799
number is always independent and as you

1220
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:46,520
know occupied by three kids okay well

1221
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:48,260
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over time so exactly</font>

1222
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,540
what we actually accounted for i think

01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i was thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what's the mixed up for this to</font>

1226
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:23,260
connect see you know p p9 and we have

actually be non-running<font color="#CCCCCC"> side chrome it's</font>

a behind a flag this is not turn on by

1229
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:30,550
default but getting the packetization so

1230
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,899
standardized as one of the things that's

1231

keeping us from<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front of the</font>

01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,730

1234
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:42,820
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of give us on the standards</font>

1235
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:45,040
track and turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an RC ok so again I</font>

1236
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:47,050
think in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of in general terms I</font>

1237
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:50,589
mean it's in disappeared for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matamata</font>

1238
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:53,050
pyramid for codec so I don't see any

1239
01:05:50,589 --> 01:05:57,250
anyone thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not part of the</font>

1240
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:58,630
payload working group took another pair

1241
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,960
after deep enough of everything that I

1242
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:03,730
don't think so anyone objecting that it

1243
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:07,119
said item for the working group to work

1244

<font color="#E5E5E5">on anyway who supports that is working</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working toward you bring work</font>

1246
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:15,098
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we will ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a milestone</font>

1247
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:17,410
for that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll start to work into</font>

1248
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:19,230
the working group document but of course

1249
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:22,839
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to review them to get a better</font>

1250
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:25,119
and to get to the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested do</font>

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on the brain exactly MO and</font>

Jonathan I need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about okay this</font>

1253
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,868
doctrine probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to that</font>

1254
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:46,200
ok ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this was the last</font>

1255
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation and thank you and we'll see</font>

1258
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:07,510
a milestone and and then confirm on the

1259
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:15,990
list and then and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll tell you that</font>

1260
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:15,990
well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you should the tissue and</font>

1261
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only thing you should make us to do</font>

1262
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:25,109
this step something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's like to</font>

1263
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,790
remind us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask for much</font>

document as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well sir I'll take care we</font>

1266
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:37,450
need well to ask for agreement of all

the doc way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe the true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> character</font>

1268
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:44,020
yet about them what's the last mountain

1269
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:47,618
then we can start putting the loan

1270
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,630
because it is what them series<font color="#E5E5E5"> MLP they</font>

this is the cutest<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is the meeting go</font>
