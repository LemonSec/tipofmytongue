1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,850
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thoughts</font>

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,260
additionally the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place where feedback</font>

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,389
would be good is there's different

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,820
styles with which to present the final

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,619
kind of schema whether it's down to how

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,090
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see kind of spacing how do</font>

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,130
you want to see you know types defined

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,869
versus natively kind of embedding kind

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,150
of classes if you have strong feelings

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:30,960
about kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> either of those be great</font>

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:33,120
to put on a list Kathleen Moriarty so

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
from past experience I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would love to see</font>

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,150
if we can get a couple of volunteers who

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,820
might go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and comb the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UML versus</font>

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,180
the schema so that we reduce the errata

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,400
that gets filed later so maybe the

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:55,590
chairs could um try to get a couple of

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:58,019
volunteers anyone so<font color="#E5E5E5"> would anyone here</font>

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,640
be willing to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and what just</font>

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,340
it entails just making sure everything

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,830
matches up between so I'm sorry so we

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,990
have how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh great good so we have</font>

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,640
three thank you because it's it's so

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,369
easy to miss stuff and we had a slew of

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,770
them on the first one it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,640
easier if we can thank you yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,350
the other thing that would help in

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,999
addition to the UML and the XML is that

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,979
we've been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep keep a</font>

30
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,630
changelog going about what's different I

31
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,159
know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very good about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,439
mean I find things aren't we missing all

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,969
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if in you and out of that</font>

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,288
pass if you could take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at that</font>

35
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,369
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be greatly appreciated future</font>

36
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:37,409
implementers well thank you can ask ke

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Glen question about um I assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

38
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,350
are tools that can help too or is it

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,889
more than that just making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that XML</font>

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,130
matches the EML scheme when we say uml I

41
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:52,979
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have used uml light so</font>

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not sure how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much the tools will</font>

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:02:00,329
help us here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'm saying how</font>

44
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,009
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some you tools that will take the</font>

45
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,139
UML and compared to the schema and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

46
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,789
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comment that will use uml</font>

47
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,499
light a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit i'm not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

48
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">tricky worried especially the way we</font>

49
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:10,889
represented in the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

50
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,208
know how we'd extracted<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone someone</font>

51
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">has a piece of tech that i can extract</font>

52
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask yarn I'm all ears that'd be</font>

53
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:23,410
great actually mmm

54
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,579
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> really exciting actually all</font>

55
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">right next slide I just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some of these issues in depth now</font>

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,830
so the mailing list has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been really</font>

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,920
active in the last day or two on this

59
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,780
particular issue so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this</font>

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,420
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half ago about the</font>

61
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,490
fact that the software type the IDF

62
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,500
software type which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a way to just</font>

63
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,480
describe an application or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of</font>

64
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,010
kind of software whether it's saying hey

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,290
I got my data from this piece of

66
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,760
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> or this piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software was</font>

67
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,470
targeted we have this data type to

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,829
explain that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forth</font>

69
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a year ago just about switz was</font>

70
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,390
kind of mentioned we said punt at that

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,160
time in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honolulu we said we had a lot of</font>

72
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,679
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> options at this point we</font>

73
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,350
really do have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide and so the four</font>

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,500
options it leads to four options I think

75
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,600
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our use oval you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> swig don't do</font>

76
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,890
anything just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's someone else</font>

77
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,930
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font>

78
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,880
additional data or the last approach is

79
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,520
to support multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques to</font>

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,269
include one and two and use something

81
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,460
like the IDF sei extension or the Edam

82
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,130
kind of draft just to put in an eye on a

83
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,480
registry things like one and two and

84
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,940
potentially other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and then have a</font>

85
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,090
blob to represent what that raw format

86
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,440
would be so we have a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

87
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">said kind of on the mailing list are</font>

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:47,890
there other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to set</font>

89
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:51,640
conversation do have a feel for which

90
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,589
option is preferred but the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

91
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,570
like he was leaning towards for no one

92
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,730
said anything positive about 12 or three

93
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,400
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the feedback it was okay o</font>

94
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,200
plus fund that one I think yeah but de

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:08,200
vuelta<font color="#CCCCCC"> my plus one on for as well</font>

96
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:10,269
because I I think um type of identifies

97
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,910
and the registers might change all the

98
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:16,810
time so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be you know</font>

99
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,459
corner yourself by yeah so this is Sean

100
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,769
trainer so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of took the</font>

101
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">bait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this one right so for me I like</font>

102
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,250
it this way like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ophelie is like kind of</font>

103
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,919
like some of the de facto standard rate

104
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,450
and it's used there's a thousands of

105
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,169
maybe hundreds of thousands maybe

106
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,639
correct me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seemed</font>

107
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,039
really weird to<font color="#E5E5E5"> force everybody to go to</font>

108
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">sweat right when i first started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

109
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,188
at slid it was maybe a little confusing

110
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,080
whether you had the pain to get a number

111
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be bad for open source people</font>

112
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,698
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't seem to make first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,109
didn't seem to make sense so if we pics

114
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,509
wit and we make everybody switch from

115
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,860
oval that seems weird right then we

116
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,900
could come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a mapping scheme is</font>

117
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,270
that what we really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I don't</font>

118
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and then don't define it all seems</font>

119
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">like kind of not really doing anything</font>

120
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,938
it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe supporting both</font>

121
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,770
seems like the way to go and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

122
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you really need to begin MTI here</font>

123
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,068
I think it's whatever because the idea

124
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,569
is can you get a free identifiers and

125
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,249
then is the database that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

126
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go look at actually available they</font>

127
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:15,620
both are so great we're covered Kathleen

128
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:17,689
Moriarty contributor so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also agree</font>

129
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,629
that that's a fine answer because as

130
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:22,159
Alexei said it will change over time

131
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:25,430
groups can choose what they want to use

132
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:28,729
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't spend a year arguing about</font>

133
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,839
this yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last ones with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hat</font>

134
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:36,229
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah Dave altameyer again I</font>

135
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:39,289
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with everything that was said at</font>

136
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:42,830
the mic here I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for because we can</font>

137
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:45,110
incorporate you know the other options

138
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,628
into into four<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it provides the</font>

139
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,370
flexibility and extensibility that will

140
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:54,889
likely need overtime so so so i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

141
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,139
get i tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support for is the right</font>

142
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,729
answer so a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pulling that thread</font>

143
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,740
a little bit if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what</font>

144
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,568
we did with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enum draft which is to</font>

145
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,159
say yes it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

146
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,169
enumerated references but as it turns

147
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,360
out if we're going to create the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enter</font>

148
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:11,568
registry and create an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML format that's</font>

149
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,490
probably useful across the ITF for folks

150
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:15,080
that are on an XML representation and

151
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,180
maybe others will even use the I at a

152
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,149
registry as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking kind of with</font>

153
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,580
sockem and i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adam</font>

154
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the get theirs is there because</font>

155
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,688
benefits of the working group to take

156
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,969
the this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking to implement</font>

157
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:31,729
option for for software type and to

158
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:33,589
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very short draft in the</font>

159
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,330
light it kind of in the same vein as the

160
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,199
Edam draft for this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and this</font>

161
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,199
would be useful to sac

162
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:49,069
what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> second's perspective yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> edda</font>

163
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:51,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">montville yeah it's useful for soccer it</font>

164
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,779
will be and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just no question so</font>

165
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:55,729
yeah you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'll help</font>

166
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:58,219
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that yeah I think I mean what</font>

167
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:01,188
why don't we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that together allows</font>

168
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:03,909
you to credit this<font color="#E5E5E5"> manga say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again how</font>

169
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:07,129
about you to quit the small draft I

170
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:11,239
didn't understand it this new small

171
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:14,089
draft swim<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new and I yeah we'll</font>

172
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:15,078
work on it ok ok we'd already been kind

173
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,639
of thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this would not would be</font>

174
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,159
the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the enum</font>

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:26,839
draft I mean kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of short and straight</font>

176
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:28,429
forward in<font color="#CCCCCC"> eldidd just one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a day of all</font>

177
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,079
tomorrow one clarifying question are we

178
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:32,958
talking about creating another I in a

179
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:36,860
table for software or are we talking

180
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,569
about adding entries to the eye on the

181
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:44,629
table that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been created under the</font>

182
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:52,189
email draft as an example I was thinking

183
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:54,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">different I'm sorry Adam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our kuleana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

184
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:57,079
home I could see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> going either way so</font>

185
00:07:54,409 --> 00:08:00,679
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

186
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,899
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then move forward like Terry we can</font>

187
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:04,578
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it after this yeah that makes</font>

188
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,559
sense and go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and all that</font>

189
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,819
yes absolutely all that I mean those

190
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:11,259
present the option cause and cons of

191
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,259
making you one using something different

192
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:16,729
but John field also agrees with number

193
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:21,169
four open enables open and forward

194
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:22,279
compatibility ok so we're tipping for is

195
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:31,188
there anyone that wants to speak up

196
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:33,000
about 12 or three or a present five all

197
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:34,169
right

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,299
for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conserve some</font>

199
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,280
religions on this one yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

200
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,530
think four is the answer so Adam and I

201
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,370
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work to get a draft a skeleton</font>

202
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,319
draft that will reference will create a

203
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,420
separate extension for i/o def software

204
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,860
type also you have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

205
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,630
space and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in addition we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will bring the</font>

206
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,730
list the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know</font>

207
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,490
reuse the eye on a reg traded crayton

208
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">uin register okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1001 question</font>

209
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,930
regarding number four I guess the

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,729
current mechanics like<font color="#CCCCCC"> enim or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

211
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,739
excite both of them can be used as well

212
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,300
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have when you drop I use</font>

213
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,060
it or any you are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at</font>

214
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,890
least but why we have and add any reason

215
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,530
to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new draft on that and</font>

216
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,900
because what extensibility we are using

217
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,220
iron on table both of the inner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

218
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">either they're both of them are using</font>

219
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,450
that I am table for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension and</font>

220
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,449
this is a chance for us to the

221
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,670
extensions are so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> appoint to use</font>

222
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,250
to have a new draft on that if you have

223
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,030
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear that so</font>

224
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that is that I</font>

225
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,819
guess I think it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

226
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,400
conversation of do we need a new I enter

227
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,350
cable or not because right now in IDF

228
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,150
SEI and Edom each one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

229
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">classes that are defined the class of</font>

230
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,689
themselves aren't the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's what</font>

231
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,820
I in a registry they're bound to so if

232
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,470
it turns out that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can reuse one of</font>

233
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,700
the ini registries that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who'd</font>

234
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,020
actually make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reference one of</font>

235
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,080
those are the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if it turns</font>

236
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,120
out that that's not the case then you

237
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,130
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should kind of may need to get</font>

238
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a new draft I think then the question</font>

239
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,880
is assuming we do all that are then we

240
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,410
comfortable with whatever is the name

241
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,920
that's assigned to kind of all of those

242
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,420
whether it's in the SE iron table

243
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,890
tomorrow from my understanding the

244
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,599
regardless of whether we decide to

245
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,920
create a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye on a table or use the</font>

246
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,100
existing ones we're going to have to

247
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">write a draft to instruct Diana to do</font>

248
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,630
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so a new draft will be</font>

249
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,030
required no matter what these are true

250
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,220
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a specific into</font>

251
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,079
recoil and also expert review so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

252
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have experts with you we can just change</font>

253
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,950
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> table i guess that my understand</font>

254
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,050
each other or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not is it expert review</font>

255
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,470
for SEL don't turn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little over one in</font>

256
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,219
a month where I guess is it yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

257
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,660
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the</font>

258
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,410
options and why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we kind of stereo</font>

259
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,939
stare at it again

260
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,259
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make sure that that's part</font>

261
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the conversation so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be the</font>

262
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,009
purpose of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper going in the transit so</font>

263
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,110
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there is no reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font>

264
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:57,690
in your draft and there is nothing

265
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,709
absolute<font color="#E5E5E5"> read basically but I'll image</font>

266
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">package so um looks like we're going</font>

267
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,819
with option for and then we need a

268
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit of discussion or some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

269
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:09,990
know if you want to discuss privately

270
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,638
and then circulate in the mailing list

271
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:17,639
your ideas that would be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense</font>

272
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok moving on to the next issue so this</font>

273
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about specifying related dns and we</font>

274
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">have these options on the mailing list</font>

275
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,469
as well and so the thinking here is that

276
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:30,120
we want right now we have a series of

277
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,240
classes for lack of a better term that

278
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,470
we describe a records so we can describe

279
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,300
domain names<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of IP addresses</font>

280
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,189
but all the other things that we can do

281
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,719
can with<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns are not described all the</font>

282
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,610
different kind of record types and so

283
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,079
there is this desire to represent some

284
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information and so there is a</font>

285
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:49,019
stub in the data model for related<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

286
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,759
we have all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml isms of how you</font>

287
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,329
represent those things the problem that

288
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,730
what we don't have is what is the actual

289
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:59,699
representation of the difference of the

290
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,990
other the different dns fields and we

291
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:02,339
kind of talked about it i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

292
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,009
initially started<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not</font>

293
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,509
listed here is that just use dig output

294
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,610
as a blob and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put it in there</font>

295
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,259
that honestly was a good answer and so

296
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,930
we need to think about a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

297
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:16,079
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was sorry it actually</font>

298
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,660
is option two it was include comma

299
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,729
separated values and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honolulu we</font>

300
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,560
talked a little bit more where Paul said

301
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,470
I have a JSON draft why don't we use the

302
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,630
JSON draft then with them there was

303
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,130
further discussion on the list about hey

304
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,420
why don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just punt on this the same</font>

305
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,649
way we would have punted on the last and

306
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,360
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's additional data it's someone</font>

307
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,250
else's problem and then there's the

308
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,980
possibility that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one has taken up</font>

309
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,839
work on is someone could actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font>

310
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,189
eyes the JSON draft were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of come up</font>

311
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,100
with a representation for all the

312
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:45,959
different dns types so either way I

313
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to decide I think two</font>

314
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,258
things we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide whether we</font>

315
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,019
still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this or we're going to</font>

316
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,420
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pun on this outright or can we</font>

317
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,029
want to adopt one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these I guess that</font>

318
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">punch on on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is honestly option three</font>

319
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,680
do we want to implement one one two or

320
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:00,939
four

321
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,819
where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone else have anything to</font>

322
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,950
add to the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the mailing</font>

323
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,070
list the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback to date what kind of</font>

324
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,600
was there was not consensus the one

325
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,190
thing that folks said about the juice on

326
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,290
drafted which is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

327
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,390
its JSON and so that's a little kludgy

328
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:21,459
to bring you to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML with some of the</font>

329
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:26,589
some of the feedback feelings are strong

330
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:29,020
feelings sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that folks Uzi be</font>

331
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,580
strong feeling so um Shawn Turner no

332
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,020
strong feelings here the only thing

333
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,670
about referring to the other draft is

334
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,550
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the status is</font>

335
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,959
so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it anyway it's experimental right</font>

336
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,979
now that is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of the</font>

337
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:52,599
concert yeah that yeah I'm not loving

338
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:55,390
that well Jason looking group<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

339
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,830
closed and all off<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my got some cycles</font>

340
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:02,500
I don't know whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

341
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:04,029
take this option I mean the other thing

342
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,380
with the JSON is we could I mean there's

343
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:07,180
blob and where we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> define this</font>

344
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,660
transformation because again it's not

345
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that complicated so we're standards</font>

346
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,620
track and that's experimental that's

347
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly that's exactly right yeah so</font>

348
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then the second thing is does</font>

349
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,440
anybody actually think that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

350
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">one defining related does anybody not</font>

351
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,150
think that creating the XML for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS is</font>

352
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,240
not the correct way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

353
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the work I sense that it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

354
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,160
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean if there's a</font>

355
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,959
lot of head nodding I just is there

356
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,959
anybody who thinks that's not the case

357
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:49,029
Kathleen Moriarty I'm an agreement and

358
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,650
I've been you know inserts where you

359
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,770
know they show me what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

360
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to do this stuff I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't anymore</font>

361
00:14:52,770 --> 00:15:00,550
and DNS is huge for them right they rely

362
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:02,770
on lookups and sharing pics you know

363
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:06,099
data that you can't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore because</font>

364
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,230
the who is information is gone and dns

365
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,310
lookups are gone but they still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

366
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:15,040
show the history of attack profile so

367
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,760
you know you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just leave in the dns</font>

368
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and or an entry and then expect that the</font>

369
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,200
data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be transitioned around</font>

370
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,080
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone right so you</font>

371
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:33,460
need it in the incident data that goes

372
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:35,830
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange yes Kristen so</font>

373
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">christmassy oh so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's just to find</font>

374
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:45,610
that yes okay I'll work on the defining

375
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:51,279
dns records in in XML and I'll foisted

376
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:53,500
on you fair enough we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a volunteer</font>

377
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:58,930
you'll preempted my question you know

378
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:00,430
thank you perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay any other</font>

379
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,729
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> unrelated do this I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

380
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:09,670
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resolved okay next slide</font>

381
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,620
please oh yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

382
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,229
that's in the tracker and the origin of

383
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,970
this is cross walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think actually</font>

384
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,440
in this case it was standard on the

385
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,170
incident reporting one of the things

386
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one of the things that that's cut</font>

387
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,490
we wanted to capture is what is the

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,070
cause of the incident and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

389
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,520
question of put on the table is 50 70

390
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">bits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sei does it through I</font>

391
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,130
owed f dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEI can the weakness class</font>

392
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,589
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need is specifying the cause of</font>

393
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,920
an incident is that weakness class from

394
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:44,380
the SEI drafts efficient does anyone

395
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,849
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see something different and so</font>

396
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">again the weakness class I mean talk is</font>

397
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,610
going to correct me here I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

398
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,110
again is a pointer would be a pointer to

399
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,480
an external registry that would be a

400
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,950
dictionary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weaknesses I think</font>

401
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,160
other options would include trying to

402
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:04,329
define our own dictionary it's why i

403
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,980
framed it that way yeah I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

404
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,010
might divide a compelling argument for

405
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:13,689
reusing other dictionaries is a good

406
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea if you can do that by the way for</font>

407
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of pointer I guess not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only a</font>

408
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,319
CA but also animal draft would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful</font>

409
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,020
maybe that could be more useful for the

410
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,639
enemy to attack same projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

411
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,049
drafted for the pointer to that

412
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,659
identifier

413
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:31,899
GW has identify years so maybe CW could

414
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:41,259
be used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there by annum draft</font>

415
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:53,049
rather than AC I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well cwe</font>

416
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:53,920
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> email yeah other thoughts so</font>

417
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,750
that's that's an

418
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,160
option why don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on the list</font>

419
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,720
and see whether there's any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

420
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,390
feelings one way our kind of the other

421
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,860
but I what I hear is no excitement you

422
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,500
define your own dictionary which i think

423
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,719
is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea it's a question of</font>

424
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:13,330
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way to point2 points to</font>

425
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:16,900
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dictionary okay do you</font>

426
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:20,439
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of proposal in your mind how</font>

427
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,080
this might look like or is it still need

428
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,130
a bit of thought I think it requires a

429
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">little thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think our talk</font>

430
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,950
is right i mean we should in part of

431
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,310
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down to what do we</font>

432
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:34,420
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say in 50 70 yes I think it's</font>

433
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:37,330
difficult what we want to say point back

434
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,760
to i def SEI that creates its own set of

435
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,260
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that's that's one kind of path</font>

436
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,570
the other way to say it is not

437
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,240
references at all and someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> just drops</font>

438
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:49,179
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sei reference through additional</font>

439
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,820
data and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the third option</font>

440
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,460
is to potentially drop the you know

441
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,629
something through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the e nom draft as a</font>

442
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,400
way I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think part of it comes it</font>

443
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,010
comes down to if we acknowledge its that

444
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,020
talking about weaknesses is the thing

445
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,270
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concern do we want to just say</font>

446
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,340
yes SE I can handle it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it</font>

447
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,379
pulled in or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one is explicitly</font>

448
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,850
with if you 70<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reference we know</font>

449
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,620
that this is important go to this place

450
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,939
to read about I mean it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

451
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a design approach about how</font>

452
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,120
we fold in honestly the all the great

453
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,189
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the sei ask that was</font>

454
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,429
missed in the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a suggestion</font>

455
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,430
can you create three examples of the

456
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,710
three things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and post it to the</font>

457
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list and just let people before</font>

458
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,370
you do more work than that yeah good

459
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was not as much as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

460
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,050
do yeah Sam make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> tascam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian</font>

461
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think you have a lot of insight but on</font>

462
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other hand other end of the</font>

463
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:42,040
discussion that draft and I only speak

464
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,870
trust would be ready a large document so

465
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so easy to read it is</font>

466
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,409
possible to split some content<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

467
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">guidance raft we could cater to that</font>

468
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:53,050
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to write some content of</font>

469
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,400
this I guess so you think we have to

470
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,040
write more texture on us understand

471
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,050
sorry I mean some contents this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

472
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,240
consideration could go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guidance</font>

473
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,560
draft as well because guy that could be

474
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,990
a existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that reason I guess right</font>

475
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:11,178
maybe a fourth option right up

476
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:16,789
okay I can do that further thoughts on

477
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that okay so i just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out</font>

478
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,360
something didn't make this Lodge and

479
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,940
this is this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got in</font>

480
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,428
various feedback from folks that have

481
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,499
looked at the looked at the text and

482
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:29,539
they gave different feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

483
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:30,769
the mailing list and so this morning so

484
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,120
i can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i just</font>

485
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted to kind of point it out but you</font>

486
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,590
can read the details on the mailing list

487
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:38,509
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its a feedback was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

488
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,519
to share tens or hundreds of thousands

489
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:43,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a particular indicator think big long</font>

490
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,259
text file of IP addresses I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

491
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:46,909
that excited the feedback was you know

492
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:48,950
they weren't all that excited to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap</font>

493
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:50,480
each individual IP address with all the

494
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,149
XML and they said wouldn't it be really

495
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,279
great if we had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> big tag that I could</font>

496
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:57,799
drop my big long list of IP address in

497
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,840
IP addresses in and so the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

498
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharing just was just honestly a lot lot</font>

499
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,259
more kind of simple and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what</font>

500
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was saying something on the order of</font>

501
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:08,179
bulk observables so bulk observables

502
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say what's what what is there</font>

503
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,279
one per row of on the list and we would

504
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,590
support get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some subset of the</font>

505
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,509
observables we currently have was one

506
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,299
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of feedback the other bit of</font>

507
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:22,940
feedback was the counter right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

508
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,799
counts particular rates actual measured

509
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,379
rates it would be really nice to also

510
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,879
convey things like peak rates or average

511
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:31,279
rates and actually might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of</font>

512
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,959
others that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can of worms so that was one</font>

513
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,600
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback and then there is this</font>

514
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,570
notion of right now we can describe the

515
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,428
observed protocol but the observed

516
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,289
protocol number like the tcp port may

517
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:46,220
not actually be associated with what's

518
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:51,019
actually using that port so if Iran HTTP

519
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:53,749
on you know 830 71 I might there's a way

520
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:56,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say i ran a 371 tcp but there's no</font>

521
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:57,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to say that that was HTTP so is</font>

522
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,299
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to represent that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

523
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,190
the three bits of feedback I got

524
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:06,710
privately sounds that maybe you should

525
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,639
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trick items for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and I I</font>

526
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:13,940
will I will do exactly that good ok so

527
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:16,070
there's those things that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

528
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,080
in terms of the formalism I will say you

529
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the text needs work more help on</font>

530
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,720
the text please editorial things please

531
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,260
well the list of outstanding issues is

532
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,680
much shorter this time then it wasn't

533
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:35,100
whole which is a good sign retrying so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

534
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,640
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we should strive to do a</font>

535
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,730
working group last call for Prague

536
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,380
Graham we can talk offline about you

537
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,830
know maybe we'll pick a date<font color="#CCCCCC"> in early</font>

538
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,900
April to start the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and um do you</font>

539
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,080
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any changes outstanding I'm and</font>

540
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,910
turn to remember do you have an

541
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,040
unpublished version of the draft that

542
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,990
you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I do there's a few</font>

543
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,220
editorial things I've already caught all

544
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:33,350
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wish that Alan okay</font>

546
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah earlier about twenty cents in this</font>

547
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,610
case yeah I guess let's do

548
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,200
implementation report on when somebody

549
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,209
came up to me and asked you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where</font>

550
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,730
the new presentation is going to be I

551
00:23:51,210 --> 00:24:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">said up to this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway let's switch</font>

552

light weight indicator exchange i have

679
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,570
approximately 10 slides and

680
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,240
approximately 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll go</font>

through pretty quickly on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

682
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> approach is to kind of</font>

683
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,000
run through the content it's simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

684
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:39,100
quick overview and introduction for

members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team is the group who</font>

686
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,169
perhaps have not looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

687
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,050
it's been out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for a while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

688
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:57,810
really this is just kind of to to bring

689
00:32:47,050 --> 00:33:00,930
it to the fore so next slide please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">well yeah yeah you guys can can click</font>

691
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,070
forward we're going to talk about what

692
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:07,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the rolly draft and at a very high</font>

693
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:10,080
level what motivated it so the idea here

694
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,790
is that a while back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the</font>

695
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,230

702
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,760
have another way to do things intended

703
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,610
to supplement or to complement what we

704
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,920
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and I think fills a need</font>

705
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:49,949
that we may not currently be addressing

706
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:52,680
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please okay so in short</font>

707
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:55,830
rowley is a restful approach to sharing

708
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,440
cybersecurity information and the idea

709
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:01,620
is in a nutshell very simple way to

710
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,770
interpret this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I created what is</font>

711
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,560
essentially an atom feed binding for i/o

712
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:11,489
def and rid and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept was to</font>

713
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:14,969
enable people to do a loser coupling so

714
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:18,689
that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be exchanged more</font>

715
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:21,839
dynamically and to do that in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

716
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,340
was a symmetric in the adoption we'll

717
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,700
talk a little bit about that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

718
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,760
forward but I think one of the concepts

719
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:31,889
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current interchange capabilities</font>

720
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,290
is that it is a peer-to-peer message

721
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,379
based approach rather than something

722
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more asymmetric and perhaps more</font>

723
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,180
restful in that we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things more</font>

724
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:45,990
dynamically without as much

infrastructure as a precondition next

<font color="#E5E5E5">slide a little bit</font>

727
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,899

728
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">your pause here ok so the high-level</font>

729
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:01,490
goals high level goals of the draft were

730
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,490
to make it easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do simple sharing</font>

731
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:07,089
the notion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone with a feed</font>

732
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:11,359
reader can participate anyone with an

733
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:13,359
HTTP client can publish the idea was

734
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,710
that it would reduce the need for

735
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,369
operational coordination between the

736
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:22,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">parties that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing the sharing on</font>

737
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:25,040
the notion also was to leverage existing

738
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:26,930
identity management investments so

739
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,750
obviously a lot of investment is gone in

740
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,618
over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of years and</font>

741
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,740
building out<font color="#CCCCCC"> identity management</font>

742
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:37,250
infrastructure everything from sam'l 20

743
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,930
off to and everything in between um I

744
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we have something of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disconnect</font>

745
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:45,759
in that the authentication and

746
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:49,430
authorization of existing message based

747
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,880
interactions has the notion of identity

748
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:55,368
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parties rather than identity of</font>

749
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,750
the individuals that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are representing</font>

750
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,670
those parties I think I think that's

751
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:02,540
something that perhaps is a gap<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

752
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:05,869
could close another idea here is that we

753
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:08,420
can avoid a heavier requirements for

754
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:11,270
distributed policy enforcement the

755
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:15,109
notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once a message is exchanged</font>

756
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:17,329
that we're relying on distributed policy

757
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforcement I've imagined an iodophor</font>

758
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">rid message that has been a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent in</font>

759
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,308
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a query enforcement</font>

760
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:28,790
mechanisms have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to occur and will occur</font>

761
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:31,339
at the destination the approach enrollee

762
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:35,029
was to emphasize enforcement that the

763
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:37,160
source essentially resulting in an

764
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,059
elusive coupling between the parties

765
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:43,040
also a lack of a requirements avoid a

766
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:46,839
requirement for a lot of state

767
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,950
management on the side of the provider

768
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,430
improving the scalability of the

769
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:56,359
provider really nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's Noom here</font>

770
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,490
this is really a an attempt to adopt the

771
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,230
approach taken by essentially the rest

772
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,598
of the web which is that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,280

to participate regardless of the

789
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,808
specific role that the party was going

790
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,059
to be fulfilling if you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

791
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:55,910
role<font color="#CCCCCC"> of purely a consumer and not a</font>

792
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:57,470
publisher you needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build much of</font>

793
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,868
the same infrastructure that a publisher

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,209
would build using an approach as

described<font color="#E5E5E5"> enrolling would allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

796
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,829
more asymmetric deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with having symmetry</font>

798
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:12,589
except that it makes it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

799
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:16,279
harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on board from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of</font>

800
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:19,160
view of the the larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> community when we</font>

801
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,970
think about sharing at very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale</font>

802
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,480
the goal was that for many use cases for

803
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:29,290
many participant roles being able to do

804
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,640
an identity-based authorization and

805
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,500
participating via a restful feed would

806
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,890
be sufficient and appropriate for those

807
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:39,290
use cases it doesn't exclude other uses

808
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,890
it's more supplementing and enabling

809
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:44,839
participation for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

810
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:47,328
all of the infrastructure necessary for

814
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,229
just go through this is real quick this

815
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:05,140
is kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nuts and bolts try to</font>

816
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:09,680
ground some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what i've said in</font>

817
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:12,920
realistic tangible use cases imagine a

818
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,500
case where there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> red query the the</font>

819
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,099
burden to actually do the compute task

820
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,230
in really responding to the query falls

821
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:24,680
on the provider it falls on the server

822
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:27,500
who's serving that response whereas what

823
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,680
I think we see in other examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

824
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,680
big data data crunching problem is that

825
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,538
we put the burden of consuming the feed

826
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the client so it kind of reverses</font>

827
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:41,859
things in a sense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I want a</font>

828
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:44,269
specific let's say complicated query

829
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:46,880
could be any number of elements in the

830
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:48,439
predicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the task of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

831

sorting through that could fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

832
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,450
client rather than to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server it's</font>

833
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:56,660
simply another option to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

834
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:59,328
case of a red report on the use case

835
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,149
that we stumbled into when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were doing</font>

836
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:05,059
the POC work was that doing the

837
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,710
distributed transactional integrity made

838
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,690
things a little bit challenging in terms

839
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,390
of maintaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> State on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server um</font>

840
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,640
with a more restful style the server

841
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,098

842
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:23,089

844
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:28,670
in many cases here by the way that we

00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:31,609
talked about in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly draft that the</font>

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,900
use cases the idea here is to support

850
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:44,119
broad sharing so imagine a government

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,339

00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:56,150
something like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rollie draft would</font>

856
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,670
enable people to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> explore and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discover</font>

857
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:01,549
in that repository and effectively

858
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:04,609
obtain what was needed with less

863
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:14,270
I think that's a use case that's well

864
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,340
handled today but would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be excluded</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">by Rowley it would simply be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

accepting incident reports from partners

868
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,440
and customers again I like this one

869
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,390

this is complementary to the existing

00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:58,669
RFC's the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to leverage immediate</font>

00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:12,260
possible but that's what I chose to do

in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first double zero draft the use</font>

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:19,100
of existing HTTP return codes would I

885
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,930
think be sufficient to enable clients to

886
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,750
interoperate between the existing

887
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:28,480

introduced next<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

889
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:41,058
so a summary wrapping up basically the

890
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,558
notion is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally kind of view</font>

00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,829
the cyber security challenge as an

893
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:51,380
attribute to a an attacker generally

894
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,710
loosely coupled collaboration patterns

895
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,880
with a high degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of technical agility</font>

896
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,069
really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an environment with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I concluded that the message</font>

when deployed and operated in a

00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:12,650
symmetric fashion and i was looking to

903
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:16,069
complement that with an asymmetric

904
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,809
approach that would hopefully enable the

905
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:19,730
economics and the scalability that are

906
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:21,140
needed in order to enable sharing

907
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,440
between people who couldn't participate

908
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,058
today loose coupling and a uniform

that the endpoint is still protected

right unless you can have multiple

943
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,910
levels of access and of course some

944

other information is not public and

946
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:12,530
requires privileged access I would

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:43,279
on for this just an observation when I

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,599
may not be aware of it but this

959
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,940

960
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,880
internal networks to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these exchanges</font>

966
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,619
a real opportunity that basically people

<font color="#E5E5E5">are generally using lightweight HTTP</font>

restful approach and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course i think</font>

969
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,920
that immediately implies they need to

970
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:25,399
standardize it in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't do a study i just walked</font>

does<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shawn Turner it's just kind of a</font>

978
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:43,550
general comment um I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to nanog in</font>

979
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,589
February and like six of the 24

980
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,970
presentations were about d das and some

981
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:49,220
of the complaints where the stuff is too

982
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,569
hard to use the existing things are

983
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,919
really too hard to use so anything that

984
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:54,319
makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the operators to</font>

985
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,359
actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to report this thing up</font>

986
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,400
is really good and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that they</font>

987
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:59,900
kind of get how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do restful things and</font>

988
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,339
people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understand how to do that</font>

989
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,559
so this I think

990
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:05,630
a really great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm Thank You Sean</font>

991
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:08,359
yeah I mean to add to that comment the

992
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,789
idea that the the restful approach can

993
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">get you started perhaps think of it like</font>

994
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:15,349
the you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big toe in the</font>

995
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:17,599
water or you know whatever analogy you

996
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,609
want to use whatever metaphor it enables

997
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,849
you to begin participating in the

998
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:24,499
sharing and build up over time on it's

999
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:26,539
very likely at least i thought you know

1000
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:28,819
in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience in the PSC it was very</font>

1001
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:30,829
likely that some people some

1002
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:34,549
organizations participating in a sharing

1003
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:37,519
network in a consortium start out by

1004
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:39,200
being read only and then eventually kind

1005
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,930
of move up the food chain and become

1006
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,210
full-fledged members on so again another

1007
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,660
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage the investment</font>

1008
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:49,519
we've already got in the existing

1009
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:52,759
representation formats and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1010
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,288
use those in a wide variety of use cases

1011
00:47:52,759 --> 00:48:05,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we perhaps wouldn't address</font>

1012
00:47:54,289 --> 00:48:08,180
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i don't know if you</font>

1013
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:11,089
guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this but my screen just</font>

1014
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:17,719
went on standby hopefully that hasn't

1015
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:28,009
caused the problem we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> still see okay</font>

1016
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay any</font>

1017
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,840
the comments questions often thank you

1018
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,339
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your presentation will try to push</font>

1020
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,290
document after we've done the 50 70 base

1021
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:46,000
but in the meantime if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have any</font>

1022
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:49,370
updates make them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1023
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,730
application area review of you know the

1024
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,680
way you use rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you very</font>

1025
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:58,430
much I'm until I can find people but

1026
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,589
I'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one last comment is that</font>

1027
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:02,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously a ten-minute segment</font>

1028
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,340
so it's hard to cover all of these cases

1029
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd encourage people to take a look at</font>

1030
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first couple of sections of the</font>

1031
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,900
draft I do in the draft try to lay out

1032
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,730
some of the rationale um I tend to do

1033
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,070
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years doing</font>

1034
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:18,020
architecture work I I feel compelled to

1035
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,360
lay out the rationale as to how we got

1036
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:23,240
to this point so I'd appreciate feedback

1037
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,430
on on those sections in particular the

1038
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,160
obviously the technical nitty-gritty of

1039
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,750
the details of the binding is open for

1040
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,359
discussion and we'd probably have many

1041
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,940
more discussions over that I think

1042
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,130
really the motivation and the rationale

1043
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:51,140
is is probably the appropriate focus for

1044
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:54,470
now okay so this is the end of our

1045
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:58,839
agenda any other business any other

1046
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:58,839
questions announcements related to mile

1047
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:22,819
yeah okay ah well thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

1048
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you have present I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how</font>

1049
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:34,940
much time yes you have an hour and eight

1050
00:50:28,940 --> 00:51:46,579
minute before your lunch Joey<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

1051
00:50:34,940 --> 00:51:49,690
you yes so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two questions when</font>

1052
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:49,690
it will be deposited

1053
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,160
drop this off
