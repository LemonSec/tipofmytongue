1
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,230
you

2
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um so does somebody want to cut the</font>

3
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,730
crowd noise and close the door<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

4
00:00:51,330 --> 00:01:05,620
okay I can't talk well so welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

5
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">hose a working group hopefully this is</font>

6
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:16,650
the last time we see all of you people

7
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:25,750
as the hose a working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to</font>

8
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:36,430
become an ex chair it's been as opposed

9
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:41,539
to be immature but my ad would never do

10
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:45,780
that to me now

11
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:51,420
so the standard no well applies to this

12
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:55,170
meeting the information which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

13
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:00,630
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> find on our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> charter page is is</font>

14
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:04,350
here document status is so all of the

15
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,509
documents which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in our view</font>

16
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,970
to have written have been written they

17
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,949
have all gone to the RSC editor there

18
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,140
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently two drafts which are in</font>

19
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Edit state and all of the rest of</font>

20
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">the drafts are actually in the rest</font>

21
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:20,130
state waiting for those two drafts to

22
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,819
get finished so with any luck we'll

23
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,760
actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into off 48 and</font>

24
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:35,010
out of off 48 by if not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

27
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,040
stuff we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the the two</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">documents which we have which are doing</font>

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,798

30
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,290
cozy after that and then as time permits

31
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:57,269
will totally will have a presentation

32
00:02:52,290 --> 00:03:00,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">from mike about his he managed</font>

33
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,190
signatures and potentially talk a little

34
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,859
bit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that's currently hot</font>

35
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,799
on the list is people still want to have

36
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:11,040
some form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clear message signatures</font>

37
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,450
and we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's anybody who</font>

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,200
thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

activity the one issue that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,769
have on the thumb draft document are the

44
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,370
actually receive any from anybody is the

45
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,709
thumbprint draft is currently on

46
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,639
standards track given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's no</font>

47
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,169
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defining any things</font>

which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be actively and</font>

immediately used such as header

parameters but just defines an algorithm

51
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">fry to do something there is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,829
of should we move it down to some

53
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,350
standards track<font color="#CCCCCC"> the informational</font>

54
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:08,550
so if anybody wants to express an

55
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:10,510
opinion on that we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to hear it yes</font>

56
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,630
the word much does appear in the

57
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,630
document

58
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,430
huh

59
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,659
ha

60
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,370
Joe Hildebrand check I don't know

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,570
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike on yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is the</font>

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,010
implication that if it has the word must

63
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:51,990
in it that it has to be on scanners

64
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:54,920
track and not informational track<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carrie</font>

65
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,500
Lynn no not necessarily but if this is

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,240
required anywhere then it just seems

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it should potentially be on a</font>

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,900
standards track I mean I'm new here or

69
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,900
so I'm just

70
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:31,869
Matt Miller um you know they're being

71
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">2119 language and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

72
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:35,169
necessarily bother me it's if you're

73
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:37,839
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this then one must do this</font>

74
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,039
is fine with me and as far as the

75
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,119
document itself I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sent</font>

76
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,498
something list but i'm fine with

77
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:46,499
information information off

78
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mike Jones Microsoft I know of one other</font>

79
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,260
standards document in another body that

80
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,000
would take a normative reference to it

81
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,789
should we finish it I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,360
status would prevent that from happening

83
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:15,910
I'm more curious what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard ITF</font>

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,770
practice is for just making this

85
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,690
decision and I'm fine either way just

86
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:34,030
follow what we would normally do we're

87
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:35,950
doing it right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

88
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,299
the input that we have received<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

89
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,440
anyone else wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us additional</font>

90
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,020
input I will take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that under advisement</font>

91
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,170
and as soon as we get it pushed up to

92
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ad we will have a decision as part</font>

93
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,500
of that process

94
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:33,219
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on okay I had to figure out</font>

95
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,279
whether it was a slide switch for a

96
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:42,759
rocker switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so will now have a</font>

97
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:45,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation about two documents that</font>

98
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,680
have been presented as potential

99
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:53,520
candidates for cozy and then we'll talk

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should happen with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cozy next</font>

101
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:03,998
so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at is the two</font>

102
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:07,149
specifications we have had basically

103
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:10,330
said there's a large parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jose</font>

104
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,860
world that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep but there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

105
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,318
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

106
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,870
are going to change the first and

107
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest is of course we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,709
be cryptographically a compatible so

109
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:24,669
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make changes so that you</font>

110
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:27,129
will not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to transform a document</font>

111
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:30,520
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hose a document to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cozy</font>

112
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:34,180
document or back again we obviously want

113
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,698
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use seaboard idioms rather than Jose</font>

114
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,978
it rather than Jason idioms whenever

115
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:41,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible so we can lose some of the</font>

116
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:46,630
things like base64 encoding because we

117
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:49,060
have natively binary encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

118
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,449
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a bit of changes in terms of</font>

119
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:56,189
naming things so that we can save a

120
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:59,380
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of space if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use integers</font>

121
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,660
we're somewhere strings are used in in

122
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,189
places there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are maybe so there can be</font>

123
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,170
some places where we'll keep strings

124
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,569
some places where we'll probably swap

125
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:12,250
strings to be integers just because it

126
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:13,810
presses everything down there are

127
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,420
however things that we will want to

128
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">reuse we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to basically won't use</font>

129
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,410
the same algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> registering we may</font>

130
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,849
add some algorithms to that registry in

131
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,139
factory almost certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> will add some</font>

132
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,629
outcomes to that registry

133
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:29,199
but we're actually going to keep the

134
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:31,480
same infirmary the structure where we

135
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:35,049
can we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> header</font>

136
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,970
parameter registry so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

137
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:43,809
things that we get defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> into cozy for</font>

138
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,759
things like core will actually be

139
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:49,540
available for anyone who is using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jose</font>

140
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,669
stuff as well for example is quite

141
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,980
possible that the sequence number which

142
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for replay</font>

143
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:01,029
will be useful in some various

144
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:03,369
algorithms that are various places that

145
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,100
are you currently using Hosea for some

146
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,359
reason various reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and we're also</font>

147
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,239
going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the basic</font>

148
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:12,579
paradigms so you know this in terms of

149
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:17,249
how you structure things that's going to

150
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:20,979
tend to stay pretty much similar next um

151
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:24,279
so Kirsten produced a document which is

152
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,610
out there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he basically took the</font>

153
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,699
simplistic approach that is we're going

154
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:34,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the structure is</font>

155
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:36,339
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> there're in in Jose and just</font>

156
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">replace it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with seaboard so basically</font>

157
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:40,089
you start by you know any place where

158
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,040
you you have binary data you actually

159
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">use a binary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding you don't use</font>

160
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,389
base64<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding we obviously use</font>

161
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:50,079
seaboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than Jason for actually</font>

162
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:53,589
doing the encoding we use integers for

163
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:58,540
map names in the large number<font color="#E5E5E5"> places but</font>

164
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:02,889
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily everywhere and with</font>

165
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,649
encoding using maps and raised in places

166
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:08,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">we might use periods his original</font>

167
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,019
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually continue to use maps</font>

168
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,329
but it's easy enough to change it into

169
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,539
using periods and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of plays in a</font>

170
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:18,399
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places Joe Hildebrand so for</font>

171
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:21,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who haven't done much Seaborg</font>

172
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,339
it's useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain this whole</font>

173
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:27,009
integers is map names thing so in JSON

174
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,519
the the keys on the in the key value

175
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:31,899
pair are always strings in c bore

176
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,269
basically any type can be on the left

177
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,440
hand side and there's this sort of

178
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,710
emerging kind

179
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,380
of sort of approach in the Seaboard

180
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,080
world that if you've got a small number

181
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,180
of keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are well enumerated you can</font>

182
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,020
instead use small integers that take up

183
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,550
a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite in their encoding and you</font>

184
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,590
can use both negative integers and

185
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,560
positive integers for that and if

186
00:11:53,590 --> 00:12:01,680
they're less than 23 so you get sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

187
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,869
46 ish of these things plus or minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

188
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you've got a good number of keys</font>

189
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you can put into a</font>

190
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:14,770
registry of some kind and you can in the

191
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:17,950
same map also use strings as keys so it

192
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:21,250
allows you to do extensions without

193
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to register them so that the sort</font>

194
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cool way of doing it is you</font>

195
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,600
register all the ones you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

196
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and then allow people to</font>

197
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,740
use strings for whatever else they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

198
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,930
to use we could decide whether that was

199
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,060
an approach we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use here or not</font>

200
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,880
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems to have worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

201
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,969
conceptually in some other protocols and

202
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,390
even if you overflow that that there's

203
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:46,450
no small 46 number of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you go</font>

204
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,790
up to 256 bytes you know you're

205
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,160
basically still looking at you know

206
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,540
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bytes for that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

207
00:12:51,160 --> 00:13:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the same as using one character</font>

208
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:05,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is what an encoding looks</font>

209
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,870
like using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diagnostic dump that's</font>

210
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,820
much easier to read than using the hex

211
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,500
dump even though i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there's way</font>

212
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,620
too much information<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for anyone to</font>

213
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,650
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read pick up the slides</font>

214
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:24,430
later if you're actually interested this

215
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:31,650
is actually an<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding of yes it must</font>

216
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:31,650
be two signatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

217
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:39,549
so the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i wrote uses a lot</font>

218
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,888
of the same approach we're using

219
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:46,239
seaboard we're using base using binary

220
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:49,029
update 64 I've actually ran ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

221
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:54,009
replaced several of the maps with arrays

222
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:57,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we keep maps for headers but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font>

223
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:59,139
arrays for the all the external

224
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:02,799
structures for you know what the

225
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:05,859
signature is what this signature data is

226
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:10,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">recipient structure the encrypted</font>

227
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:12,939
structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm a firm</font>

228
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:15,699
believer in it separated signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

229
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:18,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">max I don't believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

230
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:22,599
plus for max we want to actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

231
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:24,089
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do recipients stuff so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

232
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,509
actually do key management with it

233
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:31,569
that's no was I did that long before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

234
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:37,689
draft came out that Mike did for key

235
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:39,939
management with bridge with jws and I'd

236
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:42,189
actually reused the exact same structure

237
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:45,279
for the encrypted body and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

238
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:47,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">recipients so the same code deals with</font>

239
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:52,959
both of them which actually potentially

240
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:55,059
save save save some code there next and

241
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,209
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same</font>

242
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:02,999
example I had up there before looks like

243
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:05,589
with the the Seaboard diagnostic dump

244
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:08,230
and you really aren't going to see that

245
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">many things there's some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extra nulls in</font>

246
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,959
there and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> some places where curly</font>

247
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:16,049
brace is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tremendous into square brackets</font>

248
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:20,289
I'm not actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

249
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:22,720
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what my stuff looks like is</font>

250
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:26,110
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got as in the slides it's also in</font>

251
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft so we're now going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on</font>

252
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,160
and look at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the design decisions</font>

253
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:34,988
that I made that I thought were actually

254
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,608
very reasonable to do so we strive start

255
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:40,179
by they see if you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> at size</font>

256
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:42,069
comparisons so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically I went</font>

257
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:45,180
ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied the you know use</font>

258
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:49,680
integers or other than strings 22

259
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,479
draft that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arsene produced and this is</font>

260
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,390
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have you know once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

261
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,950
nor one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac one when encrypt it show</font>

262
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,430
encryption so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three different</font>

263
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:06,270
messages they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically minimal</font>

264
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:11,640
messages so for example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac does the</font>

265
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:13,920
designer only has unprotected headers it

266
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,230
doesn't have unprotected and protected

267
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,849
headers the sizes would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the same</font>

268
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,020
whether you had unprotected headers or

269
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:25,890
protected headers in terms of both

270
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Carsten and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mice encoding if you had if</font>

271
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:31,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> added other fields that the sizes</font>

272
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,329
would would go up and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and would</font>

273
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,390
they wouldn't actually happen just come

274
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:39,120
out basically the same nut sizes all the

275
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:43,860
time this does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> include things like</font>

276
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:48,480
IVs this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just the overhead</font>

277
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:51,390
of encoding the basic structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Justin</font>

278
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">richer for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose column is this for</font>

279
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,650
the compact encodings or the JSON and

280
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,530
coatings or the flattened JSON and

281
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:02,750
cuttings ah this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jason encoding</font>

282
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it's the big one thank you again</font>

283
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:11,910
okay next okay so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

284
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:16,649
analysis of what's the cost differential

285
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,780
on doing maps versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> erase and this is</font>

286
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:23,280
again assuming you're using integer

287
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,500
indexed maps um so if you're doing an

288
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,119
array it costs you a bite to have a null

289
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,530
in some place that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font>

290
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">something they're not using that field</font>

291
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:36,290
so if you aren't if you don't have

292
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,610
authenticated header fields then it

293
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,740
costs you about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a null in there</font>

294
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:44,429
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still have to keep the</font>

297
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,400

both authenticated and unattended cated

299
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,770

302
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,270
on the size comparisons perhaps some

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,360

307
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:24,630
enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now let's be fine okay yeah</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">because otherwise is trying to I need to</font>

309
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,200
annotate it so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people could</font>

310
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,760
actually understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's there it's</font>

311
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,020
what's there basically it was enough for

312
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,810
me to figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on and</font>

313
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">not much more so AV looking at the body</font>

314
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,310
of a signature there are four fields

315
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,340
that are in the body of its signature

316
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:48,510
basically you always have two of them

317
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,520
filled you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have basically the</font>

318
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,710
de sumption I was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing detached</font>

319
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:57,000
content so you'd always have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> content</font>

320
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:02,670
you'd always have some header fields in

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature um there's a signature</font>

322
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">item you always there three items</font>

323
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,360
there's always two of them filled so

324
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that can give you gives you an</font>

325
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,949
idea and the signature body it doesn't

326
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really matter whether you have an array</font>

327
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:21,090
or a map is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out about</font>

328
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,590
the same both both ways depending on

329
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:27,179
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to fill those extra</font>

330
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:30,510
fields<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to try damn it is a little</font>

331
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,690
bit cheaper probably to have the array

332
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,980
rather than the map because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

333
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,460
you're always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be paying that</font>

334
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,890
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra byte for having the map or</font>

335
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">fragment and they rate in the array but</font>

336
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,810
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying two extra bytes over the</font>

337
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,450
terms of app for the further for that

338
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm similarly of that analysis up here

339
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:56,400
for an encrypted body the recipient and

340
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,500
basically the recipient structures in

341
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,530
terms of what you're transmitting on the

342
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,980
wire for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing anarres is the only</font>

343
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,750
real big loser on the other hand it's

344
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,320
quite possible that we'll look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

345
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,309
say the fact that you're using basically

346
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,439
identical

347
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:16,139
code 44 doing the recipient body and the

348
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,279
recipient<font color="#E5E5E5"> struck a structure that the</font>

349
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:19,139
encrypted body in the encrypted

350
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,749
structures gives you enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a code</font>

351
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:23,490
savings on the chip that you're willing

352
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay that that that additional wire</font>

353
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost using integers for Strings</font>

354
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:37,980
obviously it's a big win on the

355
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">left-hand side of the map but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

356
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,909
possible we could actually do do some of

357
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:43,499
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same substitution on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right-hand</font>

358
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:49,919
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the map so we could assign</font>

359
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:52,559
integers for algorithm names big<font color="#CCCCCC"> win the</font>

360
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,940
one issue that comes up that we're going

361
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to potentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with in some</font>

362
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:01,049
way is implementations may have to be

363
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,749
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with having either the</font>

364
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,720
string value or the integer value there

365
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:09,929
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I know I can always send</font>

366
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,460
the integer value but I may receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

367
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,320
string value because I'm receiving it

368
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,149
from someone who doesn't produce that

369
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,769
yet because they rolled it out before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

370
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:22,168
say they will the string out before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

371
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,340
sign them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number and may actually be</font>

372
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:27,450
in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,908
strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know so that that's</font>

374
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,210
actually something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we need</font>

375
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:35,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think about in terms of as we move</font>

376
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,129
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we add new extension things</font>

377
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,749
and we assign numbers to them what

378
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:43,049
happens in terms of do we actually

379
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:44,700
assign numbers how soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> how quickly do</font>

380
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:46,799
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign numbers do we need to</font>

381
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,820
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up an early member assignment</font>

382
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:57,810
process so that we don't get the strings

383
00:21:50,820 --> 00:22:00,600
rolled out instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> integers next</font>

384
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:03,419
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I did in the</font>

385
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:07,110
array structure is I went ahead and

386
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">assigned an element in the base array to</font>

387
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,020
say this is what the type of the

388
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:16,320
structure is I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do any</font>

389
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,650
sort of fancy i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to infer the</font>

390
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,240
type based upon something else it's

391
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,880
cursed and suggested that we can

392
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially actually assign some</font>

393
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,780
seaboard tags to identify what the

394
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:33,660
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure types are</font>

395
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:36,540
looking at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is actually a</font>

396
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:40,020
wash in terms of size because I've got

397
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,909
one bite for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the array for</font>

398
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,710
to say this is what the type of the

399
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure is where I've got one bite</font>

400
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,720
outside the array which says this is the

401
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:54,420
tag for that type of structure so it's

402
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,930
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it obviously you don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

403
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:00,120
your state if you stick with the the

404
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,700
more the mapping version because you can

405
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,790
use a similar sort of analysis that's

406
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:09,270
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> done for Jose to say whether</font>

407
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:13,230
something is a signature or<font color="#CCCCCC"> an encrypted</font>

408
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack so that takes up most useful if</font>

409
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,390
these structures actually might mix it

410
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,980
with some other structures in some place

411
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,050
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have the tank right on the</font>

412
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">outside and would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out is</font>

413
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:28,610
this even cozier as or is it something

414
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,610
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different yes</font>

415
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,658
Joe Hildebrand so I would suggest that

416
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,279
when we go down this path<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figure out</font>

417
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:44,130
what the subset of C board that we're

418
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:47,250
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using is so for example we</font>

419
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:50,399
might not need floats for this work in

420
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,200
which case the thing that I'm using to

421
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:55,889
parse this doesn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include all</font>

422
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,190
the float parsing yeah so it saves on

423
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:02,010
provides ways nice and I also probably

424
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:06,630
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do the streaming bits</font>

425
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:09,029
for example and the next thing that's

426
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,169
right on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lip of that would be tags</font>

427
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:14,909
for me and I what I found with tag so

428
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:18,529
far is that they're useful when I want

429
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:21,149
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular datatype on</font>

430
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:23,570
receiving so I want to tag the thing as

431
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:27,149
a date so that I create a date object

432
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:30,139
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of creating a string object we</font>

433
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:35,459
may or may not have any of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

434
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:37,500
that sort of syntax level of creating

435
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> object is as important to us</font>

436
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,840
well we may know all the types ahead of

437
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,639
time right maybe that's the case then we

438
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the tags necessarily right</font>

439
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that I mean one of the questions</font>

440
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:53,459
on that basically becomes is this always

441
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,020
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-level object or are</font>

442
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,340
they going to get embedded into

443
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:02,460
something mm-hmm so that for example if

444
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:06,120
you do you know a cryptid thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

445
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,830
also assigned thing it could become very

446
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,918
useful when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the payload at</font>

447
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,299
that point to say this is what it is as

448
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,000
opposed to having to figure out what the

449
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,950
payload is from something else Derrick

450
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,720
Hopkins in my use case it's definitely

451
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:25,049
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded and nested okay I mean</font>

452
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,390
is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ace stuff today that they</font>

453
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,500
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about was always top level</font>

454
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,730
and they always knew what it was from

455
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,470
external signals<font color="#E5E5E5"> matt miller for at</font>

456
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,200
least my uses of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today I've known</font>

457
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead</font>

458
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,350
what I'm dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for me it</font>

459
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,240
doesn't matter but if it's important for

460
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:46,539
others than I ought to keep Joe

461
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,669
Hildebrand again I have no opposition to

462
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,350
having tags and as I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> tags for</font>

463
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:53,019
me are right on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line that I could be</font>

464
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,639
argued either way on so if there's a

465
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,490
good reason to do it I'm all for it if

466
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:59,830
there's not we probably save 10 bytes in

467
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,690
the implementation or something it's it

468
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:09,129
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> save that much but it's a little</font>

469
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:11,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit mm-hmm so as I separated the max</font>

470
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,870
structure and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature of</font>

471
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:16,000
structures as I said it's easier to

472
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,219
discuss the security properties of what

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,980
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> max and signatures</font>

474
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:27,279
aren't put in the same pot and is quite

475
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,809
likely in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT world that they're</font>

476
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,539
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be doing signatures anyway</font>

477
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:33,580
they're actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing max</font>

478
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,990
almost all the time because they want

479
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,750
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can stand</font>

480
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,029
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wire I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't go that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far I</font>

481
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,980
don't I don't think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I on achieving</font>

482
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:44,019
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true ideally we</font>

483
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,299
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a symmetric crypto</font>

484
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,669
but it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible in all cases</font>

485
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:50,889
right I mean obviously is especially if

486
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:52,899
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the end stuff you</font>

487
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:56,350
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do signatures rather</font>

488
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:59,439
than just max um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've seen any</font>

489
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:02,649
kids please support person oh well I

490
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,240
mean no I mean the implementation will

491
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:06,850
support boat but if you in point of fact

492
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,120
separate the two of them then<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

493
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,189
allows you to say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we just can</font>

494
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,399
basically not include any of the

495
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:18,549
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and in under this</font>

496
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:20,229
library and if we're doing encryption

497
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:24,100
and then half the mac stuff is already

498
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:26,100
included anyway because the recipients

499
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's the structure furred for</font>

500
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,059
managing your keys on on for the for the

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">mac structure and for encryption</font>

502
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:36,320

503
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:43,519
exactly the same thing

<font color="#CCCCCC">ah the single encryption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> structure it</font>

505
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:51,080
simplifies<font color="#E5E5E5"> code and you know what part</font>

506
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what I'm hearing for about a third of</font>

507
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:58,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT people is we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough</font>

space to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third of them</font>

509
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,509
have we have enough space to do a small

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,220
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and a third of them is</font>

511
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:07,909
well we got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space we can do just</font>

512
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,259
about anything it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on</font>

513
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:14,539
which people you're talking to and what

514
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:17,929
day it is again we're basing it we

515
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:22,190
basically can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ad here app</font>

516
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:25,370
algorithms which may be useful in terms

517
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,379
of enforcing some some things down the

518
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,668
line in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things like this is</font>

519
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:31,969
actually the name of the algorithm we're

520
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:34,519
doing Mike Mike Jones just a

521
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:37,789
clarification question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I know</font>

522
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,129
what you mean but is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the case that by</font>

523
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:43,539
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mean that you're folding the</font>

524
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:47,299
initialization vector value and the

525
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:51,559
encrypted data value into a single value

526
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:54,139
likes TLS does and things for aid<font color="#CCCCCC"> AE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

527
00:28:51,559 --> 00:29:00,769
algorithms no that's out that that's

528
00:28:54,139 --> 00:29:03,229
someplace else what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

529
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:05,659
other thing that allows for is is at

530
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,389
some point in the future we can move

531
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:11,659
from the composite algorithm set to it

532
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:15,289
to a Chinese menu algorithm set it's not

533
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:17,269
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a good idea but the</font>

534
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,220
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so at some point in the</font>

535
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:21,679
future is something I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

536
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,110
want to preclude so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

537
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,409
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the the the algorithm is</font>

538
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:30,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the encrypted message layer we can</font>

539
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:33,980
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the algorithm is f the</font>

540
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">keyer a player and then if you wanted to</font>

541
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,759
you could add another<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer on top of</font>

542
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:40,639
that which is this is the algorithm that

543
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:44,409
we're using do to get a key<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font>

544
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:44,408
the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap key</font>

545
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:50,100
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very low priority thing as</font>

546
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,510
far as I'm concerned and right now I

547
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,809
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should probably stay with the</font>

548
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,970
composite algorithm world but if things

549
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:59,129
start to go haywire in terms

550
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:05,450
registration we can revisit that

551
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:08,900
decision at that point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i</font>

552
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:12,990
did move the<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the author TV if</font>

553
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,900
the tag into the crypto text<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font>

554
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">moved the IV into the text into the</font>

555
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:22,500
ciphertext it is potentially something

556
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:26,940
we want to think about especially for

557
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:33,120
some algorithms um I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the</font>

558
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:34,649
people who presented in a stood a we're

559
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically talking about one of the</font>

560
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:41,428
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they want to do is use</font>

561
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,470
implicit nonces implicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> IVs with CCM so</font>

562
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:47,460
that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> trap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to transport and</font>

563
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,919
explicit IV and the question at that

564
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,100
point is do you signal that by just

565
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,490
having an empty IV field or you signal

566
00:30:53,100 --> 00:31:01,230
that by we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll the IV into</font>

567
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,549
the ciphertext stream and the algorithm

568
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,549
is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know whether this</font>

569
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,918
starts with it with an IV or not that's

570
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:10,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know part of the question is for</font>

571
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">example are there going to be is are the</font>

572
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,658
two different communities who are using

573
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the CCM code one who once IV is in one</font>

574
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,529
who doesn't want IVs and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

575
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:26,190
we know that an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that question</font>

576
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:30,330
at this point in time when we did the

577
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:33,510
analysis on which way we should go for

578
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:35,668
Jose it wasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that one</font>

579
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,379
version was was preferred over the other

580
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:39,570
version in terms of the libraries that

581
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,649
are there and since basically a lot of

582
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,830
the times we're going to be rolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

583
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:45,658
new or existing code it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

584
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,678
whatever they want to do anyways it's

585
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,659
probably not gonna make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot of</font>

586
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,940
difference it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hard to strip</font>

587
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,799
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I to strip the tag off the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

588
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,090
feed it in separately if you need to

589
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,090
because you know how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

590
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,549
you push the button

591
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:22,280
yeah don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch the mouse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad part</font>

592
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:26,510
is the mouse covers a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more space</font>

593
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:32,559
than just the pad<font color="#E5E5E5"> um one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things I</font>

594
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:35,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">did which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a cleanness of design as</font>

595
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,170
opposed to something that that

596
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:44,059
potentially really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be done is I</font>

597
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:46,240
basically separated out uh nunna fin

598
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:49,040
dicated and authenticated attributes in

599
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,559
hat put the man in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more places so</font>

600
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,379
since we're using the same structure for

601
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:58,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base encrypted message in four</font>

602
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,679
recipients obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get both the the</font>

603
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">hole for authenticated unauthenticated</font>

604
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:09,460
attributes for free at that point for

605
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:12,830
signatures basically there were just

606
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,620
unauthenticated attributes in of

607
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,280
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload and</font>

608
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,168
authenticated two attributes<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

609
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,240
associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the signature so I</font>

610
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:22,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have has split it down so that</font>

611
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,250
I have authenticated an unauthenticated

612
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,689
attributes of the payload authenticated

613
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,030
and unless indicated attributes with the

614
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:32,870
signature and who basically have made a

615
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:36,610
statement that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attributes at that</font>

616
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,689
layer only apply to that layer

617
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,639
clarification question yeah but

618
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,059
attributes do you mean hunter<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters</font>

619
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,309
header parameters yes yeah I still tend

620
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:52,070
to live way back in the CMS world where

621
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:54,139
they were yeah from a cute encryption

622
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:58,070
obviously each layer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

623
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:01,910
authentication is done on each layer so

624
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:04,879
that what you have in a recipient

625
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,950
structure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you would have an AE</font>

626
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,570
80 algorithm what you have at the

<font color="#CCCCCC">message structure you have an API</font>

628
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,250
welcome they're doing their self

629
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:18,109
separately similarly in the vicinity and

on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac the the back value computed</font>

631
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,960
applies to just what's in the message

632
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,159
layer with the payload if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

would be authentic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

636
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:30,739
authenticated by you know the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> rap</font>

637
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:38,119
algorithm that you would be using at

638
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:40,729
that layer changes I already talked

639
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,519
about we have had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to have a</font>

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,139
escc<font color="#CCCCCC"> M dash 8 I actually had to look up</font>

641
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:47,029
and figure out what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight mint</font>

642
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:51,740
because cesium actually has two

643
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:55,219
parameters they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want at HP</font>

644
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:58,640
an implicit IV in many cases that they

00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:01,250
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transport it there was an</font>

646
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,788
interesting hip work that was done by

647
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:11,059
bog mas Bob moskovits about four years

648
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:15,769
ago hi what is hip Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You host</font>

649
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:18,650
identity protocol which basically he was

650
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:21,109
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do</font>

651
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:25,640
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with as few of cryptographic</font>

652
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:27,740
primitives as possible and he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

653
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,769
point where it's like he had a es on the

654
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,118
in a crypt mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> what'd you do GCM CCMS</font>

655
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:33,288
you're fine on that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

656
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing calendar</font>

657
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:44,000
plus plus a CBC he tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great get a</font>

658
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:47,180
mode of doing H max orquidea variation

659
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,569
and that's where he got hung up is doing

660
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:56,710
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> kdf function with just in aes encrypt</font>

661
00:35:50,569 --> 00:36:00,470
operation it turns out if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

662
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:03,349
good random key to start with your fine

663
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:07,129
if you have a bad random key to start

664
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:08,390
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't really use an a yes to do</font>

665
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,630
that you really need some sort of hash

666
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,759
function there rather than a Mac

667
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:18,289
function to do that initial compression

668
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:21,829
of the the not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite so random data into</font>

669
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:23,119
random data and of course you know we're

670
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:26,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of assuming that you would also</font>

671
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,849
additionally potentially have<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy an</font>

672
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:31,190
elliptic curve if you wanted to do

673
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:34,400
something more than a shared secret key

674
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:37,089
management technique because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

675
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,089
more on the wire

676
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,160
so now we go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a chair now</font>

677
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,029
we have some interesting discussion

678
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,129
questions so the first question is how

679
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:58,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people are actually interested in</font>

680
00:36:50,130 --> 00:37:01,260
working on this I mean people who will

681
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:06,900
review the documents comment on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

682
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:10,050
documents implement documents depending

683
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,060
of the approach I'm intending to to edit

684
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,860
the document but I'm planning to do it

685
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,950
on github so people can make pull

686
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:20,880
requests if they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually help</font>

687
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:23,069
edit the document as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so people who</font>

688
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,660
are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in work in working on</font>

689
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:29,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene this work done also David</font>

690
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,540
serves up people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

691
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:36,110
actually working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document in</font>

692
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:41,009
contributing and some some form<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

693
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:43,230
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are willing to read whichever</font>

694
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,960
approach document we use and put

695
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,810
comments on the list assuming it will

696
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,410
for now we'll say the hose a list by

697
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,410
Easter

698
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:05,270
you got the plane flight home so then

699
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:10,010
you will know time in that huh yes

700
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:13,160
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a week no we need a little bit</font>

701
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,220
more reasonable deadline I'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

702
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:19,790
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are you know really</font>

703
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:22,879
really eager to get work done as opposed

704
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:27,950
to just I want to get work done it was

705
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:31,340
just kind of um we've got two approaches

706
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:33,319
we've got we've got we've got Carson's

707
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,530
document and we've got my document both

708
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:41,770
of them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably reasonable starting</font>

709
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:44,570
places my document has quite a bit more

710
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:48,530
changes from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hose a document than</font>

711
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:50,210
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carson's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does um and I don't know</font>

712
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:55,160
how much that people actually have

713
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:56,540
stomach for so let's discuss which

714
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:08,540
document you think is probably a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

715
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:12,290
starting point be my guest I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

716
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:17,380
sure it belongs in Jose I'm Kathleen

717
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:20,690
Moriarty ad so it's not in your charter

718
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:24,170
this is of interest that's the next

719
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:26,330
question I'm perfectly willing to flip

720
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,450
them that's fine yeah so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

721
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:32,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter you know even just this week</font>

722
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,089
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we're only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on Tuesday I've</font>

723
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,609
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two different sessions where</font>

724
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:40,670
this would be of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest one was red</font>

725
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">xed and the other was ace ace even came</font>

726
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,140
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a generalized thing because this</font>

727
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,720
wasn't ready yet but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group</font>

728
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,220
didn't adopt it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if it was</font>

729
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,750
done outside of the working group that

730
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,080
actually could make a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

731
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:57,890
them because then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could reference</font>

732
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:59,120
this cozy implement a cozy method

733
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,450
implementation whatever you want to call

734
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,618
it rather and just incorporate that in

735
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:08,710
the draft that they were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

736
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:12,460
I think it would be important to split

737
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:15,279
it out because these other groups are

738
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,710
interested and I don't know that people

739
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:20,109
will notice that the work is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

740
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:24,180
in Jose right i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's different</font>

741
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:26,799
enough that with the iot focus on it

742
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,868
doing a short working group to stand up

743
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,730
to get this done and get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

744
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:33,490
attention on it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACE people get in</font>

745
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,690
the room that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red X</font>

746
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,459
folks get in the room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

747
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,220
interested and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have applications</font>

748
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,819
that could be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on gsma and and</font>

749
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:45,220
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know I think it</font>

750
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:46,749
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be important enough to split it</font>

751
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,180
out but if that happens I'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

752
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:51,189
it done very quickly and i think there's

753
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,019
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i'd like to get the sense of</font>

754
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,390
you know can we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and get the</font>

755
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:58,149
momentum to do that with a new charter

756
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,920
as opposed to amending this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

757
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,940
before the next meeting because people

758
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:10,569
need this now um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay don't go away I</font>

759
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:12,339
don't go in stay put so so so so so I

760
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:17,190
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple questions on that in terms</font>

761
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:20,288
of how fast we can spend things up so if

762
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:26,619
if you ask for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're gonna have a new</font>

763
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:28,509
mailing list tomorrow yes um if we bring

764
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:30,609
up a mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start charter</font>

765
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:33,160
discussions and do this in parallel is

766
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:35,348
that acceptable I would like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

767
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,569
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away and even when i</font>

768
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:39,730
was sitting listening to this this

769
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:43,538
entire presentation you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

770
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,160
design decisions from jose making some

771
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:48,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those and the requirements clear</font>

772
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,819
hanus had raised some particular

773
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:55,359
requirements in your new charter for

774
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:56,950
cozy would make a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense and you</font>

775
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,410
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're obviously an author of a</font>

776
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:02,859
document so you being<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chair would</font>

777
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:04,149
not be so you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the switch i</font>

778
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">think would be good for lots of</font>

779
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,599
different reasons and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

780
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:10,450
more that i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even mentioning but</font>

781
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,249
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't see a problem if the energy</font>

782
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,279
is there you get a charter done with

783
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:17,770
having one ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> prague especially</font>

784
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:20,590
with the emphasis from ace like

785
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,720
in the room ace a lot of the folks said

786
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,820
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I need to see</font>

787
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,660
this done and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested</font>

788
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,520
in the space and they're following along

789
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,290
and not everybody's contributing but

790
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,660
they need all these problems for IOT

791
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,370
solved and this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help them</font>

792
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,819
right so if they can reference something

793
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:43,779
that folks with the clue on how to do

794
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:45,130
see bore and implement this that they

795
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,260
can point to I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

796
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,740
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference so yeah I I would help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

797
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so so basically I mean if in terms</font>

798
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,419
of process as long as we don't say we

799
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,509
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this work and in the Jose</font>

800
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,970
working group we would need a new

801
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:03,070
mailing list need a case so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can spend</font>

802
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:06,220
that up quickly and then it's just a

803
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:08,410
question of whether we spend the time

804
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:12,850
writing a charter and creating a working

805
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:17,259
group which is not necessarily bad Joe

806
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:19,839
Joe Joe Hildebrand I think Kathleen's on

807
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:24,630
the right track there as far as I'm

808
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:27,430
concerned I would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font>

809
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,050
frank discussion about what the new

810
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:32,259
charter ought to be I mean we'd have to

811
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,390
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and recharter an exercise doing</font>

812
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,400
that in a separate group would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

813
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:40,990
to finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the little bits and bobs</font>

814
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,820
we've got here have us yes soon but to

815
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,319
have a separate list for the new stuff

816
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,220
so we don't sort of have to intermix

817
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:50,290
them terribly much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the idea of</font>

818
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,000
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that people can find it in</font>

819
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,440
the fanfare of a new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group is</font>

820
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,090
one of the ways to get a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

821
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:02,380
extra attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think particularly</font>

822
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:04,120
with with the support from from the area

823
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,950
director directly as we have here

824
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,259
without having to go through the whole

825
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,259
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> off cycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily I assume</font>

826
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:16,030
okay good wine I think there's not

827
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,190
demand in an effort quest for speed I

828
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,720
got what in the boss cycles good so I

829
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the actual overhead</font>

830
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,319
associated with a splitting out a new

831
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group is relatively small here</font>

832
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,040
it's all work that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

833
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anyway and we get some upside from</font>

834
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,880
it so I'd say let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and do</font>

835
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:35,620
that yeah Phil home baker you know the

836
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,460
fact that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now having to spin up</font>

837
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:43,440
a new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group to change the format</font>

838
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:48,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the encoding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think really speaks to</font>

839
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:51,280
an architectural problem when just when

840
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:53,860
Jason came onto the scene the reason I

841
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">was very keen on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was I wanted to</font>

842
00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:01,600
standardize on one data model across all

843
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:03,490
of the things I wanted to do and now

844
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,330
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been looking watching this and</font>

845
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:10,270
I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> make comments when see what was</font>

846
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:15,190
being discussed I said that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

847
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:18,790
was the wrong approach I was told no

848
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:22,390
this is a private discussion it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

849
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:26,370
standard issue go away we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

850
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:29,920
talk to you you shut the door<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my face</font>

851
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:33,160
you didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to me and now</font>

852
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:37,090
the curse you didn't use the JSON data

853
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:39,279
model we're now having to write drafts

854
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:41,890
to explain how to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we've</font>

855
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,610
already standardized in a different

856
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:49,120
encoding and before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start to do</font>

857
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:52,990
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and a whole new work</font>

858
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:56,259
cycle to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do X in why I</font>

859
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:58,270
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should re-examine and see are</font>

860
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,030
the other ways that we could get the

861
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:04,060
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of compression</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

862
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:07,060
of compactness without introducing a

863
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,600
whole new data model and a whole new way

864
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,600
of doing things

865
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:24,520
so if you have proposals i would get

866
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:27,160
those in right away the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose is as close</font>

867
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,509
to being done with their charter so it's

868
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,299
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fits in the Charter and</font>

869
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you think you can fix some of</font>

870
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,770
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and you can make it with</font>

871
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:53,170
with in<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON work then you I ask you to</font>

872
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">has it it's been submitted there are</font>

873
00:46:53,170 --> 00:47:00,369
remote people yeah please microphone

874
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,589
please use the microphone there's remote

875
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:04,330
people I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are contributing</font>

876
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:07,720
and participating<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

877
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,400
i've got a technical proposal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

878
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,098
suggest that what we do is to see

879
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,960
whether doing can see war and dating the

880
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:16,300
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've already proposed which</font>

881
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,520
one gets it more compact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that</font>

882
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,089
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to need to spin up any</font>

883
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,190
working group for mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay get it in</font>

884
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:26,349
and we'll see what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but we won't</font>

885
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,530
delay at least chatting on a list a list

886
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:32,050
can open a listen close um can you do me

887
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:38,050
a favor and post the name of the draft

888
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:42,030
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jabber Joe Hildebrand um well</font>

889
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:46,150
either that or to me one of the two so

890
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:48,730
one of the proposals is a relatively

891
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:52,900
straight porting with no semantic

892
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:55,150
changes and might not require a new

893
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,380
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group depending upon how we how</font>

894
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,430
we approached it one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

895
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who've done a little bit see</font>

896
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:05,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">borrar saying i believe is that a</font>

897
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:08,230
slightly more idiomatic use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> C bore</font>

898
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:12,460
will have benefits in terms of the size

899
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:15,910
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code need to parse it and the</font>

900
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:18,970
size on the wire etc so those changes

901
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:22,330
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idioms of the syntax the target</font>

902
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,609
syntax are the things that probably sort

903
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,910
of

904
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:28,038
this for me anyway into being a little

905
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:31,339
more see more specific and making sure

906
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:35,210
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people in the room etc</font>

907
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:38,119
so that's for me I don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as an</font>

908
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:41,299
architecture issue necessarily with Jose

909
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,670
I see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a an issue with trying to</font>

910
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:50,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the best seaboard that we can for the</font>

911
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:52,999
target<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience meg jones i've read both</font>

912
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:55,130
drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> in detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's great</font>

913
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:58,868
things to take from both of them I like

914
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:02,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carsten did basically a literal</font>

915
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:05,720
re-encoding I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jim substituted</font>

916
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:08,989
arrays for maps in places where that

917
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,879
made sense I'll note that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some sense</font>

918
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:13,279
that's what we did with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the compact</font>

919
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,329
encodings we had a raised where the

920
00:49:13,279 --> 00:49:21,710
array de limiters were actually periods

921
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:25,549
rather than using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason so if I had a</font>

922
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:28,970
preference I would start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> carstens</font>

923
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:34,099
draft but applying the array changes at

924
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:37,160
a meta-level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think it's and Joe and</font>

925
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:39,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in Kirsten but</font>

926
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,589
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty critical if this is going to</font>

927
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:45,919
happen fast that we have the meta

928
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:48,950
discussion about what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes</font>

929
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,249
to Jose do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to entertain and</font>

930
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:57,890
decide them up front rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

931
00:49:52,249 --> 00:50:00,499
relitigate throughout the process if we

932
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,180
do that we could end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> 34 years like we</font>

933
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:04,749
have here and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not what</font>

934
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,749
anybody wants

935
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:15,380
Matt Miller I agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we need</font>

936
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know be very upfront very quick</font>

937
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,790
and very concise and what our

938
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,130
requirements are I do have a personal

939
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:26,600
preference that we unify our key

940
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:27,860
management model but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to</font>

941
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this done this stuff done quickly</font>

942
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,180
however I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be rushing to</font>

943
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:35,140
get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> done and have to come back</font>

944
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">later and fix it</font>

945
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,980
so look

946
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,249
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in line anyway Martin</font>

947
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">taunton the question of things like the</font>

948
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:55,308
transformation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike was talking</font>

949
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,499
about it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sorts of things</font>

950
00:50:55,309 --> 00:51:02,539
that i would rather this sort of effort

951
00:50:57,499 --> 00:51:05,598
focus on rather than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people's</font>

952
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:09,710
wishes and dreams about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jose could</font>

953
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,799
have been unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there are</font>

954
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:15,680
some concerns with moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an array</font>

955
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:16,788
based thing as opposed to a map and

956
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are advantages in either direction</font>

957
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:22,900
and extensibility in and various

958
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:25,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-offs that that need to be made</font>

959
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,740
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into questions of</font>

960
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,990
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you use numbers rather</font>

961
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:32,470
than strings in various other places to

962
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,729
save<font color="#CCCCCC"> space and how you manage that and</font>

963
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:38,299
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting discussion to</font>

964
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:40,309
have as well but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think those are the</font>

965
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:45,259
discussions you want to have otherwise

966
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:54,279
yeah years will use will pass and some

967
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:54,279
people actually want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

968
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:02,779
this may be too low level make again but

969
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:08,269
I do hear people in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> contexts still</font>

970
00:52:02,779 --> 00:52:10,880
wanting to detach to<font color="#CCCCCC"> payloads in fact</font>

971
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:15,019
that was actually presented at<font color="#E5E5E5"> age today</font>

972
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,460
I mean he was detaching payloads I mean

973
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:19,238
it obviously is doable with either

974
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,239
method

975
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:29,280
I was just seeing where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were out so</font>

976
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:31,950
it is 622 at this point so we have eight

977
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,020
minutes left so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we really</font>

978
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:39,960
want to discuss in detail missing

979
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:47,280
features or controversial features<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

980
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:49,080
um Kathleen just do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we want to</font>

981
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some do we want to nominate</font>

982
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,549
somebody to take initial cut at a

983
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:59,460
charter or a small set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

984
00:52:53,550 --> 00:53:02,580
an initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chartres nominator</font>

985
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,780
people do they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer and you</font>

986
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,210
know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a couple of tracks</font>

987
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,100
here right so from Martin and filled

988
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,450
there are some things in Jose that maybe

989
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,339
they think you're fake so if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

990
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do proposals that's that's one</font>

991
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,860
separate thing that's Jose and then yeah

992
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,750
yeah I mean obviously we're even go to

993
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,610
go to the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two full discussion</font>

994
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,800
issue yeah an initial cut is always

995
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,270
looking at this in terms of literacy

996
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,890
things pretty much just had to divide

997
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:28,560
those those things that there's two

998
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,620
tracks going on here just to clarify the

999
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,600
people that want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes and</font>

1000
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,160
think this can be done in Jose start the

1001
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion on the Jose lyst we're still</font>

1002
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:42,810
opening up a hose a list to discuss

1003
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:46,050
potential charter separate list yes cozy

1004
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:48,029
cozy<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless there's objections to that I</font>

1005
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:50,310
heard what to folks saying we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

1006
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this here and most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are supporting</font>

1007
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,299
I mean and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up a list and</font>

1008
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:57,890
close it right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think doing this in</font>

1009
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:00,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cozy list would be good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

1010
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,589
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a show of hands of people who</font>

1011
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,240
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to start with charter</font>

1012
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,240
discussions on a cozy list

1013
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so i think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the conclusion of</font>

1014
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:18,930
this conversation then is people that

1015
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,380
have proposals that need to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jose</font>

1016
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:24,960
need to get those in very soon and as

1017
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,890
soon as the cozy list is up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be</font>

1018
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,330
announced and is is there one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1019
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,720
people that want to do a first cut at a

1020
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,720
charter

1021
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:59,880
okay okay so um do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in on</font>

1022
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:01,919
this not not you John for do you do you

1023
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,160
think you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough requite I can't</font>

1024
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember your name next next to Kathleen</font>

1025
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:11,160
yes do you have enough things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1026
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:13,020
think you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in it that you</font>

1027
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to help help do that initial</font>

1028
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">trigger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> car so you're a salon right I</font>

1029
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:23,010
presented the orbiting security drafts

1030
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:25,440
okay yeah you know and so I mean we

1031
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:27,710
basically have a set of abuse cases

1032
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,020
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is interesting and</font>

1033
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:33,150
we got a good reception<font color="#E5E5E5"> at ice today but</font>

1034
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,870
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also discussion about</font>

1035
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:39,330
how it fits into the coop architecture

1036
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:42,720
which so I mean the extreme pressing

1037
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:44,940
deadlines which I hear is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1038
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:49,009
it tomorrow but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like we like not</font>

1039
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:50,910
end up in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years ahead so so</font>

1040
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:54,990
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are certain scenarios would</font>

1041
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:58,319
like to contribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as input in</font>

1042
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of sight sizes mainly off I the</font>

1043
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,380
only reason I suggested one or two

1044
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,480
people to start a channel i understand

1045
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:12,950
is I was trying I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1046
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:12,950
somebody who wasn't was it right

1047
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:22,950
yeah come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ice colchester</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

1048
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:27,009
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide an initial proposal to the</font>

1049
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:28,990
cosine chatter okay if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

1050
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:32,470
with the initial cat let's gather up

1051
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:34,750
here afterwards so I suspect Hannah's I

1052
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:37,500
suspect this I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion</font>

1053
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:42,099
that we had to be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two places</font>

1054
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:43,780
one was in the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gun go and</font>

1055
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:45,609
present it on sort of end-to-end

1056
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,050
security when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have a client</font>

1057
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:49,480
talking to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> resource over to get</font>

1058
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:52,329
some some data but the other the other

1059
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:55,599
place wait this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful is in</font>

1060
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:58,270
the context of something where the

1061
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,890
authorization server passes encode some

1062
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,900
information and wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a compact</font>

1063
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,578
encoding this is not data obviously is

1064
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,619
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about authorization</font>

1065
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:08,170
information keys and etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> there heat</font>

1066
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:10,960
transport mechanism and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case and</font>

1067
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:13,900
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly integral</font>

1068
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,940
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution because I in ace</font>

1069
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,460
because that's what all of the proposals

1070
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:19,869
would definitely need and currently you

1071
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:25,420
can add a cook up something on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

1072
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:28,780
or use the JWT or similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade a ver</font>

1073
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,309
que etc mechanism but I ideally would be

1074
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:38,470
good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this sort of more compact</font>

1075
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:40,119
version if available in a mall so dime

1076
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,680
working group share so there is also

1077
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:44,530
some ongoing discussion regarding the

1078
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">need for end-to-end or 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mm and true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1079
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">security and so for the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1080
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,930
is on this service requirements or

1081
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,400
security requirements but I think that's

1082
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:58,868
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next meeting we've stopped</font>

1083
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:02,140
speaking about solution at the initial

1084
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:04,359
time it was about we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON</font>

1085
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:09,808
facades so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be also</font>

1086
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:09,808
interested by this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

1087
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we have one other we had one</font>

1088
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:28,040
item on the list for<font color="#E5E5E5"> as time permits but</font>

1089
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:32,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mike we only have about two minutes so I</font>

1090
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:37,869
don't know do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just I guess</font>

1091
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:41,270
okay um I'll just say there's a

1092
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerPoint or actually a PDF which is</font>

1093
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:45,200
now in the meeting materials I encourage

1094
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:50,118
people to read it i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to go</font>

1095
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:56,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">through it the one actually go to the</font>

1096
00:58:50,119 --> 00:59:02,330
next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> last slide part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I did</font>

1097
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:05,600
this was to try that one to try to think

1098
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:08,210
about what lessons we might take from

1099
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:12,020
the hose<font color="#E5E5E5"> I exercise that we might pull</font>

1100
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:14,960
into the because I exercise should we do

1101
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:17,359
it and one of them that I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim</font>

1102
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:21,440
on is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were not to have</font>

1103
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,970
overloaded out in the way we did some of

1104
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,340
the structures would be cleaner and

1105
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:28,850
you'd get more code reuse I have no

1106
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:31,220
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and that was the</font>

1107
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,350
lesson there's a completely separate

1108
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:35,930
question which is whether people are

1109
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:39,440
interested in a way they weren't before

1110
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:41,390
and having key management for max and i

1111
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,490
really don't have an opinion in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1112
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:45,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to get down for the record</font>

1113
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:49,279
while we still had a working group how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1114
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:51,530
would reuse stuff were we to decide to

1115
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,540
do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not presupposing a</font>

1116
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:57,070
decision that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good list</font>

1117
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,070
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't have an opinion</font>

1118
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if everybody could read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike's</font>

1119
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,100
draft and take a look at his slides and

1120
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,330
post any comments to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

1121
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,330
that would be helpful

1122
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:18,210
anything else from the floor up with one

1123
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,089
minute to spare yeah there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> acne</font>

1124
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:23,039
buff that's one of the things that's

1125
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:25,979
happening is it was starting to use

1126
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:30,749
Jason and Jersey possibly in

1127
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:33,419
applications and so is starting to find

1128
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:35,038
issues when we're trying to apply it one

1129
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,279
of the things we quite like is a direct

1130
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:41,670
encoding a directing serialization that

1131
01:00:38,279 --> 01:00:44,369
doesn't involve base64 because of I'm

1132
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:47,910
reading through a draft I do not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1133
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:50,880
be reading examples that are a base64

1134
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:54,299
encoded of what I want to look at so i

1135
01:00:50,880 --> 01:01:00,269
have written a draft it's out there how

1136
01:00:54,299 --> 01:01:04,049
I'm Baker Jason unencoded it's only a

1137
01:01:00,269 --> 01:01:05,640
page of actual meat but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1138
01:01:04,049 --> 01:01:08,849
will be whether we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it injures</font>

1139
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:12,089
a or possibly an<font color="#CCCCCC"> acne or somewhere else</font>

1140
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:15,950
if Jersey closes can you send a link to

1141
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:19,769
that to them during<font color="#CCCCCC"> list please Mike I</font>

1142
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:22,828
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to support fill</font>

1143
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:25,769
in the sense that I do hear people

1144
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:29,489
coming up to me saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a payload</font>

1145
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:32,038
that I have a way to transmit without it

1146
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:34,890
changing how can I do a sign without

1147
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:37,729
doing the base64 I think there could be

1148
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:41,190
a one page draft that we could do that

1149
01:01:37,729 --> 01:01:42,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">would do that as an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extension even</font>

1150
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,789
though we chose not to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before</font>

1151
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,859
and I think we should at least have that

1152
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:50,099
discussion on the list before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we close</font>

1153
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:53,969
the group it's definitely Jose extension

1154
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:55,799
it's not a different thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay again</font>

1155
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:59,029
anything like that needs to get onto<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1156
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:59,029
list shortly before

1157
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:06,560
I have minutes ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so at six</font>

1158
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,759

1159
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,560

1162
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,760
