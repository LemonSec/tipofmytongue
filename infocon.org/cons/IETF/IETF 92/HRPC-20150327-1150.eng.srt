19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,630
establish the agenda if someone has

20
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,340
extra points for amendments I'd be very

issues of topics and have an overall

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,659
discussion nonetheless I would ask you

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">not to wait with your questions and</font>

33
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,649
comments until the end let's do it

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,239
rolling and please go up to the mic if

35

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,739
we published the first internet-draft

<font color="#CCCCCC">Human Rights protocols considerations</font>

59
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:30,860
let me presented it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAG session</font>

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:34,529
during ITF in Hawaii after that we

<font color="#E5E5E5">updated before the session here and also</font>

75
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,790
is increasingly observed as a tool for

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:33,140
freedom of expression and freedom of

77
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:36,950

78
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,320
by coincidence or by design some people

79
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,810
would say that the technology reflects

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,550
the people who builds the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet in</font>

the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> came about as a solution to</font>

96
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,159
as it is now somehow became a happy

one could attribute this to

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,390
people working in this working group is

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as the internet continues to grow</font>

109
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,349
the linkage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet protocols to</font>

110
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,240
Yuma right needs to become explicit

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,240
structured and intention

112
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:16,889
so considering this change in the

113
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,169
scenario we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ITF is</font>

114
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:23,099
appropriate venue also to discuss this

115
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:27,120
of course because it's where protocols

116
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:36,449
and standards have been shaped is it

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:39,630
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

118
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,310
appropriate venue to bring this this

119
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:47,630
problem one because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course is where</font>

120
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:51,680
the fundamental standards and protocols

121
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:55,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Buda internet have been taught and</font>

122
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,130
designed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

123
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,650
inspired by the work on privacy and the

124
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:05,310
privacy considerations and we think we

125
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:09,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">can move forward and think about other</font>

126
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:13,199
human rights to do this similar exercise

127
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,789
so we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the this</font>

128
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,669
research first step so focusing all the

129
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:24,409
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights itself to focus on freedom</font>

130
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,409
of expression and freedom of association

131
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,370
the reason of doing that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

132
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,049
are first generation human rights as

133
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,520
they are known and also to limit the

134
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,610
scope of the research so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

135
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,270
excluding the possibility of other work

136
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,250
done there but to limit the scope mostly

137
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,669
makes research quite a bit more

138
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,669
effective

139
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:54,290
so we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parties it to test</font>

140
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,130
hypotheses throughout the research and

141
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:00,770
we departure from this problem statement

142
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,670
that considers that they see diseases

143
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,530
enabling<font color="#E5E5E5"> characteristics of the internet</font>

144
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:10,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">which are also human rights enabling</font>

145
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,950
character is might be degraded and if

146
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:16,630
they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly defined described</font>

147

148
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,290
this might result in a loss of

149
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,340
functionality and connectivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

150
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,380

151
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,289

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:44,180
technical concepts related to these

155
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:45,770

156
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,219
challenge that we are for so our

157
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,600
approach also has been to read RFC's and

158
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,010
to see what conceptions there are about

159
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,930
technical product technical concepts

160
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,880
that would enable these rights so we

161
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,329
came across a lot of architectural

162
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,970
principles now we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been thinking about</font>

163
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,310
a technical translation of user rights

164
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,720
concepts and then we see where these two

165
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:14,030
could converge and currently we're

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,650
thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these concepts could be</font>

research questions to address the first

188
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:19,800

203
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:15,050
methodology was exactly to map protocols

and standards that we thought they<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

potentially be related to freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

expression freedom<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association and then</font>

207
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:32,819
we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a first initial list of</font>

208

<font color="#E5E5E5">quite a long listen I will not go</font>

212
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:47,209
where we try to map the rfcs based on

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:49,888
their relevance we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with with</font>

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,750

216
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,329
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association so we started with rfcs</font>

focusing on architecture on transparency

218
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:03,180
on mailing lists because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the premise was</font>

219
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,250
that they enable in a distributed way a

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,489
free freedom of association and

221

collaboration HTTP because it's been

222
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,240
quite crucial freedom of expression

227
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,120
wanted to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> other considerations</font>

228
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:30,819
have been done before so that we

229
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:35,530
wouldn't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinvent the wheel then</font>

230
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:39,670
we move forward trying to to highlight

architecture requires that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on things we</font>

00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,559
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spread around and available to</font>

296
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,629
everyone on but more importantly the

297
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,209
robustness and resilience here seems to

298
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest that the the connection needs to</font>

299
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:59,008
remain up that's a positive right that's

300
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,230
right you maintain the connection which

301
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:03,569
is different from the arm from the

302
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,740
privacy and content agnosticism which is

303
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,779
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not going to prevent this</font>

306
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,680
and I I looked probably not deeply

307
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,240
enough at the the drafts that you've got

308
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it didn't seem to me that this</font>

309
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,000
distinction was being made as carefully

310
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:27,059
as maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks thank you</font>

313
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,639
what you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying before Andrew</font>

314
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:39,420
got up that those additional items fall

315
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,519
under connectivity I think they do that

316
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,500
naturally and i think that the list of

317
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,850
three in that you originally presented

318
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,170
up the top there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> powerful</font>

319
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,050
lists of three always are more powerful

320
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,439
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists of ten or whatever but in</font>

321
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,410
fact that my intuition is this is the

322
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:01,069
right list to show people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

323
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:05,549
each of them is deep in their way i

324
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:08,280
think andruw's point about a permit of

325
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,740
capabilities versus passive the ones

326
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,449
that take effort to provide and the ones

327
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,049
in which you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want things to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

328
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:19,679
the way is a really useful distinction I

329
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:22,349
have a pro forma question that given my

330

the ability to get a bilateral or small

lists aren't designed for and I would

343
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,669
expect it to be an integral part of what

344
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,320
you're looking to achieve but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

this this this definition would work

351
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,210
quite well because there's a quite high

352
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:42,720
level of abstraction so would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also</font>

353
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,360
say that we would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define content</font>

354
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,510
agnosticism and and connectivity and

355
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,449
privacy in a far more detailed way for

356
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,460
it to be more meaningful so that it

357
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,990
would more look more like this that

358
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,289
there is a sub definition of all these

359
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,289

very much yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> juan carlos swinging first</font>

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,899
just expending a little bit on this

379
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,520
since we've been running this privacy

380
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,520
trial in the privacy topic has been

<font color="#E5E5E5">going on and on something's also to take</font>

382
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">into account is that privacy is not</font>

383
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,310
about hiding everything if the user is

384

willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> disclose information that's</font>

385
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,870
perfectly fine a protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> shoot also</font>

386
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,520
allowed that right so so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

387
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,129
the fact of preventing but having the

question here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and apologize if this</font>

394
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,929

in the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting but I think</font>

this systematic approach to taking a

look at you know this human rights issue

399
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,490
when coming back to protocol because at

400
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,290
the end of the day this is research and

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,470
is this considered you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

424
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,580
because I would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to translate that</font>

into protocols right am I in a virtual

438
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,539
to your tooth point and i'll start with

439
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the last one and with that I'd</font>

440
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:25,090
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and think</font>

441
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,390
about what radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's what better</font>

442
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:32,678
breath chat about radio in 19 80 and he

443
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:35,260
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potential of radio could</font>

444
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,950
only be fully fulfilled if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience</font>

445
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,870
would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk back and that</font>

446
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,149
seems something that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able</font>

447
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:47,439
to to achieve with a variety of

448
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:51,129
protocols on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

449
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,230
think necessarily everyone needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

450
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,419
all the time to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

451
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,520
assembly actually that would probably be

452
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:00,520
a real messy assembly if we would all

453
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,039
start talking at the same time so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

454
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,590
think it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential for people to</font>

455
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,950
organize together and to express their

456
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,590
opinion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to collaborate so so it</font>

457
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,149
would probably be something but but for

458
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,889
the radio example you could I mean you

459
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,510
could think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people could not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

460
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,279
back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual radio right they've</font>

461
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,010
could write pamphlets or they could send

462
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,870
letters so they could talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street</font>

463
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,730
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the radio</font>

464
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,770
distributed was a broadcast media that

465
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,110
did not have a exactly channel and

466
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,090
it was the problem with radio and so

467
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,919
that seems like right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

468
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,560
able to talk back so need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

469
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,260
protocols that enable people to to talk

470
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,450
back make decisions have discussions and

471
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,460
that would be then the infrastructure

472
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would enable freedom of assembly</font>

473
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and freedom of association ok on your</font>

email sir on your own you're on your

other issue about privacy and

476
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,919
transparency that's why transparency is

477
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,860
in the list because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really like that</font>

users and implements and developers

479
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,659
understand the consequences of

480

implementing a certain protocol and that

481
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,830
is understood indeed which information

<font color="#E5E5E5">could address that please so I'm</font>

510
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:36,110
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this definition and what</font>

511
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:40,610
you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a term that it defines</font>

512
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:41,389
and it bothers me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah Fred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very quick up</font>

513
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:46,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I haven't heard</font>

514
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:50,869
what bothers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> um sorry swallow the</font>

515
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:53,748
mic on fred baker so this definition in

516
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:56,119
the term freedom of association or

517
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:58,459
freedom of assembly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

518
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:01,699
go together<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that's an interesting</font>

519
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:03,919
definition or something but freedom of

520
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,039
association or freedom of assembly is

521
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,639
the freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a room like</font>

522
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,009
this or in some equivalent way to be

523
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:15,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">associated with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each other so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

524
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:18,469
think of freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of association as being</font>

525
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:21,589
about being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to endure the mailing</font>

526
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:26,359
list or having friends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook or</font>

527
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:30,109
something like that it's a continuing

528
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:35,089
status of being in some kind of a group

529
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:37,509
as opposed to my package showed up which

530
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:42,950
is what this definition says to me that

531
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:44,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">my packets show up so I think that's an</font>

532
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:51,049
interesting definition but I don't think

533
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:52,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">it defines that trim lagarde</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Leveson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

535
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:56,658
of association that concept is

536
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:59,449
historically classified as the ability

537
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:03,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be in this room without the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mere fact</font>

539
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,679
cast with suspicion so the ability to

<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to other people's ideas and</font>

541
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:17,049
receive them without just the fact that

Dave Crocker one or two slides back that

544
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:35,039
one that's a long interesting list and

545
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:37,730
for a slide that's you need just those

546
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,620
words up there have you written

547
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,679
explanations for the reasons each of

548
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,928
those are individually are important and

549
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,720
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way what the arguments against</font>

550
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:51,900
them might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be I think that discussion</font>

551
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,230
that justifies both arguments against

552
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,700
and arguments for each of these items

553
00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:00,120
will help people consider them more

554
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,890
carefully and possibly end up allowing

555
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:12,389
the list to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> made shorter or maybe</font>

longer hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel con Gilmore dkg so to</font>

557
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:18,659
comment on ladders point i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

558
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">freedom of association</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually think</font>

559
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,720
that in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy issue is</font>

560
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,209
maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more relevant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not I'm not</font>

561
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,799
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it's at least as relevant for</font>

562
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,980
freedom of association as it is for

563
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,070
freedom of expression so if you go back

564
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the freedom of association</font>

565

566
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:43,470
about privacy for freedom of expression

567
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:45,270
concretely that privacy has to do with

568
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,870
who you associate with that's that's a

569
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,870
critical element

570
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,039
you can

571
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try to to respond to some of these</font>

572
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">extremely useful contributions to our</font>

573
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:11,179
thinking thank you very much for that so

574
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:16,460
I'll start off with the remark about the

575
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:19,519
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for balancing rights and I think</font>

576
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,789
that that's that's crucial that that s

577
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:25,100
the and I think that's what a lot of the

578
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:26,750
practice in human right is about when

579
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,990
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> freedom of</font>

580
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,730
expression there are also considerations

581
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,039
where it comes to privacy there my

582
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:37,629
expression ends where your privacy

583
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:42,289
starts and vice versa<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have</font>

584
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:44,178
developed ways to to balance those

585
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:45,830
rights but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it would also be</font>

586
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:48,289
interesting to have the technical

587
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,168
translations for for balancing so that

588
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:53,899
we when we make these choices we make

589
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">well intended choices and that for the</font>

590
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:58,908
implementer developer and user it's also

591
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,340
clear what these implications are so

592
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:03,740
when they use a protocol implemented

593
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:10,009
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear what's happening on the</font>

594
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:13,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">wire or always there with application we</font>

595
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:17,740
had then about the single mentioned

596
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:20,600
concepts a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them we have</font>

597
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:24,080
defined in a little bit more detail in

598
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,199
our ID but definitely more work needs to

599
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,830
be done there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think indeeds the</font>

600
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:35,419
approach to come with arguments pro and

601
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,639
con every is a very useful addition as

602
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:40,720
well also<font color="#CCCCCC"> metaphor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the methodology</font>

603
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,719
that's that's excellent

604
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just a nose I think but the initial</font>

605
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:50,919
discussions we could see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the even</font>

606
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,679
the definition of freedom of association

607
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,830
is not that clear in the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights</font>

608
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:01,379
declaration so maybe should go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

609
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:05,439
the debate on on the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> political</font>

610
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:08,799
context of death to to go to the other

611
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,950
size of the translations as well so I

612
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:18,429
think there'll be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow steppin on</font>

613
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:22,509
this debate yes Fred said he mentioned

614
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:24,309
the mailing list as an example of

615
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:26,230
freedom<font color="#CCCCCC"> of association well that was</font>

616
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:29,080
exactly why we also started off reading

617
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,240
rfcs about mailing lists we ended up

618
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,158
here but apparently the link between

619
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,499
those two is not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we need to do</font>

620
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:40,450
more work on that and we will be doing

621
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:46,019
that and then we will continue with the

622
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:49,360
next part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah those</font>

623
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:53,230
next steps on on the methodology are

624
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,908
still to be developed so much more

625
00:31:53,230 --> 00:32:00,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rawdon while we have presented so far</font>

626
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:04,600
but our<font color="#E5E5E5"> next goal will be to start</font>

627
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:07,960
mapping cases in which these rights have

628
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,418
been violated to see if those rights

629
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,990
were violated by exploitation of

630
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:17,889
protocols and how how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens so</font>

631
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:20,139
that's an idea that came up from

632
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:22,658
actually from the interviews<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

633
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:25,840
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing throughout this week so</font>

634
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:28,119
we are still developing how but as

635
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,879
possible guidelines for mapping which

636
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:34,509
cases to address we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are thinking about</font>

637
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:37,330
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to situations of not legally</font>

638
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:40,090
sanctioned or out of jurisdiction

639
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,908
blocking filtering and privacy

<font color="#E5E5E5">expression freedom of association Justin</font>

642
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,950
richer I was wondering if you guys were

643
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">planning on differentiating between</font>

644
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,840
exploitations that are happening as a

645
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:58,158
result of the protocol running

646
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,379
as designed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol not are</font>

647
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,380
being like twisted and exploited or

648
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,059
deployed incorrectly or what have

649
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:10,490
avoided thank you that is a very good

650
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:19,940
verb in this case I guess no comment

651
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:24,320
otherwise um I think the I think both

652
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:29,590
but i think the the for the research the

653
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,629
the first might be the most beneficial I

654
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:35,120
agree and I would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

655
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:37,610
explicit about that differentiation when

656
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:43,820
that does exist because I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it</font>

657
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:46,189
does make a difference thank you Stefan

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">BOTS Mia I'm not convinced that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,419
a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am looking things that we</font>

660
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,370
can see it for instance if someone to

661
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:55,429
shut down the website that it doesn't

662
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:58,399
like if someone is using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a like a very</font>

665
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:06,139
in the normal way the way it was

666
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:09,319
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it has even been said</font>

667
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:12,440
that it was it self expression to use

668
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:16,490
this tool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think that we can</font>

669
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,830
make anything in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't be</font>

670
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:23,178
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a perversion of</font>

671
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:28,719
the protocol or not I'm i guess it's

672
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:32,540
dead end Justin do you think you could

673
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">come up with a definition of when a</font>

674
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,599
protocol would be used as intended and

675
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:37,599
when it would be preferred it

676
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,690
so I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a good example of a</font>

677
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:50,649
perversion would be would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like a DDoS</font>

678
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:52,240
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something where you are</font>

679
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:54,040
technically running everything inside

680
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,799
the lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol but it's being</font>

681
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:03,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">used in a manner that it was not</font>

682
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:08,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended for the protocol to be used no</font>

683
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:14,439
that's that's look I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leveson I was going</font>

684
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:16,960
to say letarte<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leveson I was going to</font>

685
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,180
say I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it while not necessarily a</font>

686
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,480
protocol an excellent example of

687
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:26,049
perversion might be the laws that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

688
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,319
passed about 12 years ago mandating that

689
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:32,859
every cell phone that sold include a GPS

690
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:35,770
chip so that when you call 911 report

691
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:39,450
your location to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the emergency services</font>

692
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:43,119
operator and the perversion would be

693
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,828
activating those GPS chips remotely so

694
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,390
that you can track all of the people

695
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:53,349
where they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in real time so in both</font>

696
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:57,160
your answer in both your answers there

697
00:35:53,349 --> 00:36:00,730
seems to be a breach of intentionality

698
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,629
of the protocol mm-hmm we would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

699
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:07,420
watch carefully how intentionality is

700
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:10,150
defined in the rfcs because that's not

701
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,400
necessarily clear in every RFC and

702
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,079
sometimes innovation also comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

703
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:21,339
other use of a protocol than it was

704
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:24,819
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended to do did it he said</font>

705
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:27,130
that it's not about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intention of the</font>

706
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:30,490
protocol it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the intended use of</font>

707
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:33,460
the protocol and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to say</font>

708
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:37,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that it's our intention not to define</font>

709
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:40,569
intention yeah so let me clarify my

710
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,740
comment there um your native these fred

711
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:47,470
baker so your devos example if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

712
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,479
under adidas and my computer is madly

713
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:53,859
responding<font color="#E5E5E5"> i comp you can't get there</font>

714
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,970
from your um I'm not speaking I'm not

715
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:56,980
exercising right

716
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,779
of free speech and the fact that I'm

717
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,020
receiving a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packets is not a</font>

718
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,960
question of free assembly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so coming</font>

719
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,450
back to a previous comment there but now

720
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,290
then the intended use of the protocol

721
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:14,379
maybe what I'm receiving is UDP messages

722
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:17,279
that have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain TTL or something</font>

723
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:21,490
like that traceroute message the

724
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">intention of the protocol was to talk to</font>

725
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:28,229
a port or to determine the distance to a

727
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:36,610
intention<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my I comp is to say fine</font>

00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:38,800
I'm this<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away from you ah but the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">intention of the person sending the</font>

730
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,110
messages is to cause me denial of

00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:49,390
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something so it's not an intention in</font>

733
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:56,830
the protocol it's an intention of the

734
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:58,810
party that's using the protocol right

735
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:02,500
and along those lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think that</font>

736
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:05,890
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a categorical or there maybe I</font>

737
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:09,970
should say a categorical differentiation

738
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:12,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be made between protocols that</font>

739
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been being used exactly as intended</font>

740
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:19,090
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause and therefore cause disruption</font>

741
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:21,640
versus protocols that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used not</font>

742
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:26,560
as intended but in ways that are allowed

743
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:28,540
or twisted or what have you so I think

744
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,950
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be an interesting way to</font>

Dave Crocker when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got up i was</font>

747
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:39,760
thinking of saying something that turned

748
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,890
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be pretty close to what Fred said</font>

749
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,050
I stayed up because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of a</font>

750
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:49,540
little more going I hope beyond that

751
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:52,030
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all what what this has just</font>

752
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,880
done is to highlight differences between

753
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,710
the mechanics of protocols the

754
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">administration and operation of</font>

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:06,310
invoke the use of or create protocols

757
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,290
those are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for this</font>

758
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:15,520
discussion probably can be kept

759
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:19,029
together and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself using the</font>

760
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,800
term policies and procedures as distinct

00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:25,030
from protocol so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and and the</font>

762
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,710
problem is saying policies and

763
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,650
procedures is that's usually the

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,290
operation side and above<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

765
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:35,950
what I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> call the politics but I mean</font>

766
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:42,040
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> polit policy is probably a</font>

better term and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of these is</font>

that they are the layers above layer 7

773
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:03,310
but we can't operate without them we

774
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:05,259
would like to sometimes but we can't and

775
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,740
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably factor into this</font>

discussion both essentially and

777
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,569
problematically essentially because we

778
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,560
can't operate without them and

779
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,510
problematically because they frequently

780
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,380
are distracting they move us completely

783
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,500
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand it and quite like the</font>

784
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,570
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are focused on the</font>

785
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,170
technical issues and the way the

00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:34,510
technology enables or can prevent and so

787
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,150
for example the pointing<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of abuses</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">useful thank you Andrew Sullivan i I</font>

790

to which you're looking here the idea of

792
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,150
you know the reverse use of the protocol

793
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,010
versus the appropriate use of the

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,569
this distinction sort of requires a

tilos for the protocol that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right</font>

798
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,440
there's a goal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> which the protocol is</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it that you know there's some</font>

sort of intentionality of the protocol

802
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,150
that's a that's a really hopeless road

803
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,788
precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know frequent</font>

804
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,369
the protocols are used in ways that that

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe people didn't intend in</font>

get a lot of innovation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way to</font>

811
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,329
attention precisely to how the protocol

812
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,089
works regardless of how people intended

813
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:44,309
it to be used and step outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the little bit here of privacy when we</font>

were discussing privacy considerations

825
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,980
what's exactly this if if we are

826
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,960
planning to to add a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameter in</font>

827
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,730
our protocol that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add civic</font>

828
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,890
location just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's harder to get</font>

829
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,539
this GPS signals indoors and it's going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to make easier for the technician to</font>

831
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:28,559
arrive well the privacy considerations

832
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:31,259
is telling me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good</font>

833
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,930
but actually you are open privacy a huge

834
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,160
privacy risk by sending a civic address

835
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:40,770
of a person over this protocol so I I

836
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,470
second that it's the intention may be

837
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,549
good but what what I think we are trying

838
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here by having these</font>

839
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:49,829
considerations define is letting people

840
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,260
in the protocol design have this thought

841
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:54,750
process where they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well what if</font>

842
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,329
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes bad use of this protocol</font>

843
00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:00,630
and take that into consideration in the

844
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:03,569
first place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't open as</font>

845
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">many concerts we are doing these days</font>

846
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:06,230
right

847
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,750
and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we might get to the last</font>

848
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:19,330
slides of our presentation let's see if

849
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:23,530
we make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time just considering</font>

850
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:27,670
this exercise you're going to this is

851
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:30,820
the size of of mapping vulnerabilities

852
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:34,260
we need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of help from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

853
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:38,980
I'm not an engineer myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> news's the</font>

854
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:41,890
engineer my curiosity perhaps so even if

855
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:45,220
you find something and can just send a

856
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:48,339
link in the list to help tremendously so

857
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:53,680
it's also a bit of a call for work for

858
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:58,900
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mapping those examples and yes</font>

859
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:01,690
the the next step we still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

860
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,820
further on this methodology but using

861
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,940
the concepts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have been mapping</font>

862
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:14,140
using the vulnerabilities we want to go

863
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:16,510
and check if the way it's being trotted

864
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,450
effects all the protocols affect other

865
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,850
layers of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does it</font>

866
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:25,810
impact in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> International Shin ality</font>

867
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:29,170
and ultimately in the users rights so

868
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:32,140
it's it's basically getting other inputs

869
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:34,810
from the other research steps and in

870
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:40,089
trying to concretely address the

871
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:44,110
research questions as next steps for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">research group we will continue the</font>

873
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:52,180
research on on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's and concepts</font>

874
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:53,980
and trying to match<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with the human</font>

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one on freedom of association</font>

878
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:08,140
still it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to be done</font>

879
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:11,890
we'll continue interviews trying to map

880
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,950
those cases we are going to edit the

881

interviews that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we recorded here and</font>

882
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:21,609
probably presented in the

00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:25,839
next as a film in the next ITF and pray

884
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:29,560
pray and continued collaboration in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:34,980
list is the forget something Oh Mary

886
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:38,950
Fred could you go back one slide arm

887
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:44,380
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships explicit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font>

888
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:47,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that involves authenticated identity and</font>

889
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:50,020
from a human rights perspective some

890
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,210
things I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved with relate to</font>

891
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,960
specifically women in certain cultures

892
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:59,890
that can only use their husbands

893
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:02,970
computers um and might hide a<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font>

894
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:06,069
account from their husband and use that

00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:10,029
communication vehicle to speak and to

896
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:14,290
assemble and explicitly want to be

897
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:18,760
hidden um for reasons related to their

898
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:21,960
culture um and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder where making</font>

899
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:26,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationships explicit might in fact</font>

900
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,849
lead to human rights violations I

901
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:38,319
I'm Fred I think you're talking about a

902
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,450
different kind of relationship than this

903
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,410
side is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I think this side</font>

904
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,299
is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

905
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,720
relationships between human rights

protocols exploits and vulnerabilities

907
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,509
explicit not about making the

908
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:58,270
relationships between particular humans

909
00:46:49,510 --> 00:47:00,010
explicit Lee Howard um my comic kind of

910
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:03,070
goes back to I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think it was</font>

911
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:05,680
Dave said earlier because the same tools

912
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:10,450
that can be used to suppress rights or

913
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:13,180
press individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be used to find</font>

914
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:15,819
people who are oppressing individuals

915
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,940
and suppressing rights there are bad

916
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,130
people in the world and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

917
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,650
that we can find ways to stop them while

918
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:28,079
also protecting rights and that's nearly

919
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:31,150
impossible I don't know how to do both

920
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,400
that we do not know how to do it yet

921
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:37,270
might also be a reason to do more

922
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,520
research Yesi how we could do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

923
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,680
first step would first to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> met these</font>

924
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,930
different map these different cases yes

925
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,379
and then come up with a detailed

926
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:49,569
analysis and then we could make

927
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,490
arguments about it so that's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

928
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,990
definitely not contest what you say

929
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,549
actually I would definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's</font>

930
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:57,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">convict so like I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

931
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,359
as an explicit part of the the analysis

932
00:47:57,069 --> 00:48:00,759
being done is to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

933
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:02,440
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at both sides you know I don't I</font>

934
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,470
don't necessarily trust law enforcement

935
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,980
but I also need them thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

936
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:11,230
why transparency is is crucial there so

937
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,030
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we when we make choices we</font>

938
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,170
make them in full awareness and we

939
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,359
understand what's happening and what's

940
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:21,579
possible and that would then also allow

941
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:23,589
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an accountable way of</font>

942
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:25,960
implementing these things because what

943
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:27,790
we also came across in in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

944
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,670
interviews or in several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

945
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:34,089
interviews was that non technical

946
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:37,720
demands are sometimes made by by

947
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:40,328
institutions and by governments and then

948
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,848
it's really hard to to fit that in a

949
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:44,829
technical way so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

950
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:47,529
technical approach and I understanding

951
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:50,229
that if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> then come to the IETF or</font>

952
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:52,599
two and then we say well there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these</font>

953
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:54,519
options and this has that implication

954
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,099
this has that identification we chose

955
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:58,660
for this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this so it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

956
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:06,609
of future proving our approach to

957
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:11,920
protocols and standards and I really

958
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:14,499
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can further build on on</font>

959
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,400
your insights and and your knowledge and

960
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:21,189
your experience on the list so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really</font>

961
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">hope that there will then get your</font>

962
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:26,200
insights there and we continuously post

963
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:30,430
our discussions and ideas and new topic

964
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:34,450
there and if there are then no other

965
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:39,368
questions either from the scribe or at

966
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:41,169
the mic then I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with</font>

967
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:43,119
this session<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would like to thank</font>

968
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,910
you very much for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your attention and for</font>

969
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,420
your attending this session thank you

970
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:53,190
very much as everyone filled in the the

971
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,190
blue sheets blue sheets

972
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:17,390
and then under privacy Oh coating yeah

973
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why is excuse me in the</font>

974
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:26,900
yeah so actually what he was ideal

975
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,900
objective would be

976
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:39,279
we came to find it
