00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:10,969
yeah okay sure

2
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,880
took a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough for this</font>

3
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:03,980
so welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second session of the</font>

4
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:07,009
nav of G meeting I'm afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">not we have no blue sheets for this</font>

6
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:14,060
session in despite that we were supposed

7
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have and what rank is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

8
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for them and I could not</font>

9
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:24,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">find anyone but yeah so he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,020
give a second trial trial in the

11
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:30,170
meantime just wrote for let me show you

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,259
the again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same that road you should</font>

13
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,229
we should design a new blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheets I had</font>

14
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:40,399
to remind you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the air I rtifi be a</font>

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy you could be aware of it for</font>

16
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:49,670
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you show and save you in the</font>

17
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:53,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">air during the coming our well let's go</font>

18
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,860
through the through the and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> India</font>

19
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,289
gender what we have is a set of

20
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,509
presentations that are not connected to

21
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:01,069
current documents that are under

22
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:05,649
consideration of the research group

23
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:09,830
without more photos or intended to be a

24
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:14,920
view of the different activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,920
recent results that we have projects

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,780
publications studies that have been

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:24,980
recently released a released by and that

28
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,140
we thought that and that we include two

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,379
chairs that we thought it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be of</font>

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,529
interest for the community so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

31
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:38,569
start with an update on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> opie na VI</font>

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:41,290
Derek so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to open it so home</font>

33
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,290
for a second

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:03:08,220
where are you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we go okay great</font>

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you almost way but putting it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

36
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:18,130
so it was it was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fault okay okay</font>

37
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and can I get a quick show of hands who</font>

38
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,000
has been at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lunch talk today by</font>

39
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:27,910
Chris DiBona on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source okay</font>

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,570
quite a few so basically Chris talked a

41
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,900
bit about his views on open source

42
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:38,380
project and some pitfalls and this

43
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:43,450
experience so open platform for anything

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,280
OPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> fe is one of these larger open</font>

45
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,810
source projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've had and have</font>

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,700
recently been being kicked off and so

47
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling a little bit what we are</font>

48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing there will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some ideas</font>

49
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,950
how you could get engaged so the color

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,700
of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is actually to make you aware</font>

51
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,429
and motivate you to try to think so how

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,470
you can maybe bring some of the work

53
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are doing here to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> project</font>

54
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:15,840
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fits pretty well in</font>

55
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:18,849
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next is so the</font>

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,280
OPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> fe is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier-grade integrated</font>

57
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,490
open source reference platform for any

58
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,989
free so what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so I mean of</font>

59
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,940
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain anything</font>

60
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:33,820
to you but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general the idea is that</font>

61
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,000
so at the end of phase one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the HC na</font>

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,610
VI is<font color="#E5E5E5"> G it was pretty clear that so any</font>

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,190
v as a concept and like technology

64
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform is here to stay and I mean</font>

65
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:49,890
question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok how can we expedite</font>

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,640
deployment take up how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

67
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,360
future sensitivities and so the

68
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,750
conclusion was<font color="#E5E5E5"> too sad</font>

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,300
a open source project that would develop

70
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">its weapons platform so to validate</font>

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,759
standards to provide a link to validate

72
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,580
and standards to provide feedback to two

73
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:16,449
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups or say regarding</font>

74
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:19,818
employment ability but also to really

75
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,680
provide a usable so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carrie a great</font>

76
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,409
platform that can really be used in

77
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,349
deployments and where other companies in

78
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:33,710
that space can build innovative solution

79
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:38,289
on top or on the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly ok so you</font>

80
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit ok</font>

81
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:57,629
right so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned this so we are</font>

82
00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:00,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this by psycho bringing together</font>

83
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:04,379
as a large set of vendors in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space</font>

84
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:07,110
but also users so operators service

85
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,229
providers and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they are part of</font>

86
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:15,319
the project and they also contributing

87
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:18,449
requirements and give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback and so</font>

88
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:22,039
as you know I mean in the energy space

89
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:25,409
we are working with many existing like

90
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,669
software projects or likely linux

91
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:31,949
distros hypervisors<font color="#CCCCCC"> softwares which is</font>

92
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the within my management systems like</font>

93
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:38,369
Opus Dei and so on and so open nav is

94
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:42,619
taking them integrating them improving

95
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:44,639
on them or suggested to the selecting

96
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:50,099
further enhancements or working with

97
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:53,399
those communities and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking at</font>

98
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:57,149
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> say interesting for malaria</font>

99
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:01,519
perspective interesting optimization

100
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:04,229
opportunities and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is we</font>

101
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,589
establish this nav ecosystem right by

102
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:11,449
providing a common like baseline where

103
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:15,509
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of build your ear you're</font>

104
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,889
differentiating features on top and of

105
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,889
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we're trying to promote</font>

106
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:25,229
openness vs SD preferred<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my friends</font>

107
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:28,949
platform in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space next five base so</font>

108
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:32,128
the scope is fairly well<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined so open</font>

109
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,959
a fee is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> very focusing on the</font>

110
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:38,459
virtual infrastructure and its

111
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:42,449
management so things like platforms for

112
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:45,899
for networking compute storage and their

113
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:48,689
management so OpenStack for example but

114
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,459
there of course other components that so

115
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,579
like in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software projects that</font>

116
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,080
play a role like Rome for example sdn

117
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,639
controllers and so on

118
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,169
and on the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide you can see the</font>

119
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:07,020
academic diagram with the open airy

120
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:09,419
scope so the focus is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lower part</font>

121
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,520
of course that means not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

122
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,688
systems you also need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font>

123
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:21,539
interfaces for example to vnf management

124
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:23,159
and kind of yeah provide examples how

125
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,770
the system would be used in real-world

126
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:30,180
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's what we are doing</font>

127
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,519
right now and next line and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

128
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,799
mention that we are say working

129
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:40,140
intensively with these upstream projects

130
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,750
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicating their work so we are</font>

131
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,990
for example proposing blueprints and

132
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,670
OpenStack and working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

133
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">community so all in all it's often also</font>

134
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,529
the same group of people like we were

135
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,839
working in OB AV sanggup companies you

136
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,860
and you could say and and OpenStack so

137
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,949
it works pretty well to move the

138
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:09,209
requirements from like one community and

139
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:11,910
to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and yeah listen so the</font>

140
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:14,699
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of workflow and if you're familiar</font>

141
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,170
with other open source project so bigger

142
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:21,329
ones like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> opendaylight for example so</font>

143
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,969
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> find this familiar so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

144
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:28,439
a proposal face if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start like a new</font>

145
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,360
subjectivity within OPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> fe and we have</font>

146
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,660
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> incubation phase will be kind of</font>

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,790
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing further and at some</font>

148
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">point we kind of try to make a decision</font>

149
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,199
okay this is mature enough that we can

150
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:45,120
integrate it into for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the next</font>

151
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:48,109
release and so in OPN MV it's not

152
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,420
structured in different categories so

153
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:54,449
documentation requirements integration

154
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,390
and testing and quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and development</font>

155
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:59,790
so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first phase of course we</font>

156
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,220
mainly trying to get something out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

157
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,480
not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like developing new</font>

158
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,870
features and

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,699
Alex light I can just go ahead

160
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:14,110
requirements projects they are basically

161
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:16,930
looking at at gaps right so what to pick

162
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,290
like Fort management for example and try

163
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:25,079
to suggest activities in August egg for

164
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,079
example like one just click ahead please

165
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,769
yeah so these development projects that

166
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:36,730
is the bats will software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

167
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:39,730
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> topics and so it's for</font>

168
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,019
example new approaches to service

169
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,860
training something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a topic</font>

170
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that OPN if we would do by itself take</font>

171
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead integration revocation this is</font>

172
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,269
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the groundwork that is</font>

173
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:59,370
required<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a big open source project</font>

174
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:03,310
so to kind of automate the fabrication

175
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,510
processes next light and of course

176
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:10,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's also lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of documentation</font>

177
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:15,149
required yeah go on right so again I

178
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:23,529
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about him about this</font>

179
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:25,300
so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so the the main activity</font>

180
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,240
at the moment is basically to tilt kind

181
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,149
of bootstrap the projects it started<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

182
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of last year and boot shopping</font>

183
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,889
here means we are basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> selecting</font>

184
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,760
components and trying to fit them

185
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:43,510
together trying to ordinate their

186
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,079
deployment and so on so so you see a

187
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,839
range of components we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at</font>

188
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,979
the same time basically the work also

189
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,810
has started on these other type of

190
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,560
projects of development and requirement

191
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:03,069
projects so there's a set of projects on

192
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,739
automation fault management so other

193
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,490
carrier great features<font color="#CCCCCC"> or like</font>

194
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:13,170
performance optimizations and so on and

195
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:15,089
so and in

196
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,660
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side so if you don't</font>

197
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">fertilize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of projects</font>

198
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:25,050
concerned with like integration testing

199
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,870
automation and so on right right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

200
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,329
is the complete list of projects for

201
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,410
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference you can see there's only</font>

202
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:37,109
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and so one of the reasons</font>

203
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,290
why these are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many is actually this</font>

204
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say monolithic activity that</font>

205
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,290
tries to rule out<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition and kind</font>

206
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:50,250
of slow down<font color="#E5E5E5"> invasion or something as</font>

207
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:53,069
sometimes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when they see our</font>

208
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,660
big open source project so some of those

209
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,800
activities are actually competing which

210
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,300
is other so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,660
approaches to service training for

212
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,670
example different approaches to suffer

213
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,449
if I networking so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I could</font>

214
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:10,050
this example example here's an have

215
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:14,490
actually three approaches to sdn control

216
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:18,599
so open daylight project a contrary

217
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,600
project and it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a owners activity</font>

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,320
in the future and so the way how it

219
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,000
works is that we let them go and cannot

220
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,860
see what comes out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at some</font>

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,260
point do a decision so what of those is

222
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,209
actually mature enough and useful enough

223
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:38,790
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted for for Avery's all right</font>

224
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you two examples of like</font>

225
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,849
different kinds of projects we get an

226
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:47,160
idea and so what what open if we might

227
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,600
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have one project on</font>

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,420
fault management that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite doctor</font>

229
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:58,339
and that's basically trying to improve

230
00:13:51,420 --> 00:14:03,660
the way how the infrasound and its users

231
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:06,269
basically can detect and work with with

232
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,819
failures in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual infrastructure</font>

233
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:13,829
so how to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information how to</font>

234
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:19,649
escalate it if needed or how to like

235
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:21,689
self organize and manage failures and so

236
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,380
this for example is residing in a set of

237
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:29,520
blue

238
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:31,980
proposals to<font color="#E5E5E5"> OpenStack and so another</font>

239
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,970
one is so we call that openstack-based

240
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">viendo forwarding graph project so</font>

241
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:43,680
that's taking the current work that is

242
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,720
done in onf and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open daylight so like</font>

243
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,270
the the open flow based service training

244
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,210
approach and the the current

245
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:54,600
intent-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> northbound interface</font>

246
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,100
activities in onf and build a service

247
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,860
training solution that has integrated

248
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,110
was open flow for for opening for you so

249
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,140
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could say a bit more</font>

250
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:09,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward-looking so second an ambitious</font>

251
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:11,280
activity so what so something that

252
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,130
probably could fit quite well to some of

253
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,270
the activities that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about in a</font>

254
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">vrg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right yeah so that's going to be</font>

255
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">a first and sorry so this is yeah</font>

256
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,510
basically has a set so mainly concert

257
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,589
was picking the initial set of

258
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:45,330
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> opendaylight version of</font>

259
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:48,570
OpenStack<font color="#E5E5E5"> cellphone we switch and send</font>

260
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wes and then add some support for</font>

261
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:55,320
automated deployment and testing top so

262
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are working largely on a six months</font>

263
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,170
cadence<font color="#E5E5E5"> for releases and so the</font>

264
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,630
expectation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that so after this first</font>

265
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,969
released and the upcoming ones what like

266
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,200
contain more functionality and some more

267
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,750
output from these projects and with that

268
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,170
thank you very much please check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

269
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and contact me if you want to learn how</font>

270
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:22,620
to contribute we had thank you that we

271
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,630
had time for a couple of one more two

272
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,490
questions I mean the meantime I will try

273
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix because they think is part of the</font>

274
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,120
configuration

275
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,469
reversible just one question do you

276
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,510
foresee any integration between these

277
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,870
projects you mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

278
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,630
several projects starting but at the

279
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,000
later time do you see any class to

280
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:55,420
integrate these you asking for

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,640
integration of these different internal

282
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,430
open if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it projects yes different</font>

283
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,380
components or solutions into yeah sure I

284
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean sometimes they also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complementary</font>

285
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:12,400
so it's at all like competing projects

286
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:15,520
yeah for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no to me</font>

287
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,189
neither it does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter of the</font>

288
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,470
configuration sorry kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analogy hit</font>

289
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:23,470
them I don't know if I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right so</font>

290
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,920
maybe me something so the dids more to

291
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:31,480
focus on integration or also to focus on

292
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,270

have to treat him with a high respect I

don't a very much

years in the industry and I was

317
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:50,309
forewarned that you guys could be pretty

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:07,950
immune from from harassment so next

322
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:10,109
slide please so no seriously that

323
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this is that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the old</font>

324
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:14,339
this is not my latest presentation can

327
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,879
come on so anyways so k<font color="#E5E5E5"> will add some</font>

00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:26,339
cable novices are an interesting entity

329
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:29,459
i joined<font color="#CCCCCC"> cablelabs about a year ago it</font>

331
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,109

336
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:48,449
cable operators can virtualize the

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,190
network infrastructures and leverage the

338
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,639
benefits of open networking and

339
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:59,099
everything but their presentation a

00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:38,970
of end-user devices multiple routers

things

357
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,780
and this is causing<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems for service</font>

358
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,660
providers right they've not got complete

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,060
visibility to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user device but</font>

360
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:53,120
those end-user devices are consuming the

361
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,460
service providers services so when those

362
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,439
services go wrong the service provider

363
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,960
has got very limited visibility to

364
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,510
actually do troubleshooting across that

365
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,000

366
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,440
and use virtualization techniques to

367
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,570
give a service provider better ability

368
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,780
to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that home network troubleshoot</font>

DevOps and Lean Startup methodologies

dividing it into individual challenges

382
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:51,110
and we're analyzing those and then

383
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,870
basically feeding results into our

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,449
service provider customers asking giving

385
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,580
the rationale and asking them whether

386
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,470
they agree that the result we've come up

387

with is an approach they want to move

provide Internet service provider

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,169
virtualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> platforms so there's a</font>

440
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,470
kind of bunch of fairly randomly named

441
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,830
virtual functions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

442
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,780

functions on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway what we</font>

444
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,240
basically saying with this project<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font>

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,430
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a cable operator service</font>

446
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,500
providers and indeed in an industry

standard context anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wants to</font>

448
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,570
engineer a tailings and into a network

449
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,940
the option to instantiate functions

450
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,100
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> either in the cloud environment or</font>

451
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,900
in some intermediate place and that

452
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,300
intermediate place could be with is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

453
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,860
wherever there's a physical node so if

454
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,930
your mobile operator that might be at

455
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,879
the radio base station if your cable

456
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,820
operator it might be at the fiber node

457
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,550
and also for the point of view of home

458
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,980
networking what might be instantiated on

459
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,980
the cable gateway itself and what kind

460
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,440
of resources would be necessary

461
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the capital gateway and to do that and</font>

462
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we if we virtualized things on the</font>

463
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,730
cable gateway what happens when the

464
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,729
access goes down so because i forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

routing functions virtualizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font>

466
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSA environment and and the wine</font>

467
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,809
goes down does that mean we lose routing

468
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,720
within the home environment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

469
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,860
see my printer from my pc well those are

470
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kinds of things that we've analyzed</font>

471
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,439
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the project and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've come up with</font>

472
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,480
approaches that we believe are

473
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,980
realizable and can be deployed within a

474
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,080
reasonably short period of time and

475
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,590
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out ways of which</font>

476
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,889
this enables the the cable industry to

477
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:49,709
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenarios which</font>

478
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:52,020
call out standardized functions from

<font color="#CCCCCC">over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source community as well</font>

482
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:04,200
think my last slide is so we've got this

483
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,960
said earlier on this is really a bit of

484
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,200
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> invitation really to to the vendor</font>

485
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,490
community to participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> helping us</font>

486
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,220
know the project for we've got a number

487
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:16,770
of vendors involved already in order to

488
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,480
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved there's obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

489
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:22,139
nondisclosure agreement that's really

490
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,910
about protecting the discussions and

491
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,890
then helping them to be fairly open and

492
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,799
free but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

493
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,630
everything we do is all secret we are

494
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be pretty open about our</font>

495
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,360
results we're going to be coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

496
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,129
the ITF into the relevant projects with

497
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,969
with contributions and we're going to be

498
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:44,309
contributing code data models end api's

499
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,799
into the open source community so I have

500
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">access to a team of developers pretty</font>

501
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,610
experienced Lee they've already pretty

502
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,830
active in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source community and</font>

503
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,860
they are resource and that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

504
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,360
pleased to have and we've got a

505
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,110
prototype under development I think

506
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,990
Michael is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demonstrate</font>

507
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,780
something in bits and bytes but I'm not

508
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,840
sure about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so with that hopefully</font>

509
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've survived my first my first foray</font>

510
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,000
into the ITF I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Ruiz don't say</font>

511
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,750
that too soon and it's time you near

512
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,960
sundre standards

513
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:22,900
is recording you surely going to Valley

514
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,700
Cisco so you said one thing so the

515
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,610
virtual home is different from the

516
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,380
virtual cpe art pictures that cover

517
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,229
their force that are happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

518
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,210
industry so I am associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

519
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,190
project on virtual CP from what I

520
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,140
understand at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world that we</font>

521
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">are doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at Cisco what you'll see p is</font>

522
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,150
essentially the ability to move certain

523
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,909
functions from the cpe and run it in a

524
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,770
cloud right so you can realize that in

525
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,050
multiple ways you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a virtual</font>

526
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,270
machine instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone on it for every</font>

527
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:56,139
physical CP run all the late traffic

528
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:58,360
through that CP that's one model or run

529
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,770
the traffic from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cpe classify it and</font>

530
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,790
run it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service chain on the</font>

531
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:06,970
bng right how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that different from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

532
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,379
virtual home that you guys are this how

533
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:11,680
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that different from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these efforts</font>

534
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,260
that you guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving it isn't I</font>

535
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,970
mean the I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to emphasize that we</font>

536
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,270
know we know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not about</font>

537
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,520
simplifying the cpe that's the main

538
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,670
message from this it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> managing</font>

539
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,070
the home network better by virtualizing

540
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,590
the functions so of course here you

541
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">could virtualize pretty much all the CP</font>

542
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,949
functionality and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the cloud</font>

543
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,379
I'm just basically emphasizing so that's

544
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,630
not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the focus with project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

545
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,360
so one additional comment that you said

546
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,640
done the<font color="#CCCCCC"> increased visibility into the</font>

547
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,070
home that's or at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how I</font>

548
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,310
took it one comment second point you

549
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:51,010
said was essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagnostics</font>

550
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,570
are something in essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability</font>

551
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,690
to diagnose whatever is something goes

552
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,340
wrong in a home how is what is the

553
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:02,140
architectural assumption here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

554
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:03,879
that the there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architecture</font>

555
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,340
assumptions are that there will be the

556
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,500
ability to diagnose problems within the

557
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,860
home environment as to what they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

558
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,930
is part of the study activity within the

559
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:18,639
project itself so very important to be

560
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:24,560
able to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

561
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">Briskey d do you see this as having any</font>

562
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:31,220
visible benefits for the customer or is

563
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:34,850
it mainly an internal benefit for cable

564
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,730
company this is you see my like a great

565
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:41,990
i love the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question Apple thank you very</font>

566
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,030
much trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trap the is absolutely</font>

567
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,800
about choices for customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

568
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,750
improving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer experience if we</font>

569
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,300
the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a virtuous circle</font>

570
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,760
isn't it if you supply customers with

571
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,740
services they enjoy and when things<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

572
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,450
wrong they prefer that even though

573
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,310
they've gone wrong then you sell more

574
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:02,030
services so is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like improving</font>

575
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:04,040
customer experience but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how what</font>

576
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,660
what what specifically is different from

577
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,300
what you've just implemented it

578
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,280
differently what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> different well for</font>

579
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,379
example be able to see beyond gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

580
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,360

the home beyond the routers potentially

582
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,050
by loading functionality on the routers

583
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,610
so that we can diagnose problems and see

584
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,500
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> either connectivity beyond that</font>

585
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,240
gateway if we can see the connectivity

586
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,830
beyond the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway then we could verify</font>

587
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,870
that the router router is actually

588
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,340
connected and maybe it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

590
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,610
that kind of that kind of thing but you

591
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,699
could do that without virtualization

592
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah official but it just gives you the</font>

593
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,940
flexibility to do it earlier is that we

594
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,590
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives you architectural</font>

595
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,960
flexibility you can put the functions

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,909
either in the MSO cloud or on the

597

want to change it or shall I use this

612
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:40,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we can use it this one so before</font>

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:49,240
could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up please I meet it</font>

616
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,419
before the horrible mistake of having

well now now this said let's go to the

unimportant things this is the first

633
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the reason for building this</font>

634
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,908
is is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when you move to the</font>

00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:44,470
visualize functions in there in the data

637

moving the d function ality to the club

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,590
it's not applying cloud two covers it's

640
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,899
something that is a little bit different

641
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,908
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially because two things</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of but not necessarily it's</font>

00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,630
not the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the workload the</font>

644
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,120
size of the world can be very very high

645
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,440
in other cases if you're doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hadoop</font>

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">mapreduce can be extremely high but the</font>

characteristics of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world are</font>

648
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,470
different first and second you had to

649
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:13,269
follow the shape of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network this is</font>

650
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important as well because you</font>

651
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">cannot forget that you have to attach</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> functions to two endpoints and you</font>

have to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the functionality</font>

different functions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

appropriate places so that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

658
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,570
you cannot follow and this is something

659
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,600
that we have been experimenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

660
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,189
cannot simply follow the cloud placement

661
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,580
cloud orchestration procedures and you

662
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,500
need to go a little bit fatter father

663
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,389
not only in the orchestration but as

664
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,919
well in the implementation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with</font>

665
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:52,510
overload that's one place for example

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we have found is that to</font>

667
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:58,780
have network functions that work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">provide us a predictable performance do</font>

came with that with a way of calling it

is a enhancement platform and awareness

676
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,109
essentially is to apply techniques that

677
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:25,840
have been applied before in high

678
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:27,909
performance computing like non-uniform

using the what the memory in

optimize that performance for example

why via construct like a like a bit rich

00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:18,500
knowing about this optimization that's

one place these are the results this is

well you see that the important two

important things well when we are

774
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,400
the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not about</font>

775
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,119
performance frankly we're not talking

776
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that you can get a throughput of</font>

Tang or 100 packets per second or

778
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:46,190
whatever we're talking about to be

00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,680
and this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is what is</font>

783
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated to deal with</font>

786
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,309
one place but they broke the curious

787
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,730
things when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to small packets</font>

788
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:10,520
the outperformance is two orders of

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,619
magnitude and small spark small packets

790

are really a real challenge because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

791
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:20,000
they imply a lot of movement of in

00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:22,010
memory and well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we it was</font>

793
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,270
confused because for the show that my

00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:28,520
colleagues told me that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

795
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:31,520
adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scale so the red was at least</font>

796
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,319
shown there because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two orders of</font>

00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:39,230
it next one please so for these to

799
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:41,089
achieve this we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the current</font>

started<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font>

803
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,520
originally it was something that we

804
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:52,339
started to do at<font color="#CCCCCC"> home for our lab and to</font>

805
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,750
demonstrate is once we went into more

806
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:56,390
detail and we talked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of our</font>

00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:04,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">be reasonable to to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to contribute it</font>

are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contribute us back even</font>

don't

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:20,860
it at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good result</font>

816
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:24,700
well here is it has an enhanced

snapshot of the efficient so whoever

wants to contribute is welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

839
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,920
let me confess one thing the vim is not

840
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,850
based on OpenStack it's not open<font color="#CCCCCC"> stock</font>

841
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,560
oh great thing yes why because the

current<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of urban zagnut next</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">slide please doesn't support this apiary</font>

844
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,230
awareness and what we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid is</font>

845
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,110
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation in which you take</font>

846
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:38,140
open sac and you make some modules you

847
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,790
put them as<font color="#E5E5E5"> adults at song and you</font>

848
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:43,270
contribute you don't contribute then you

849
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:45,490
leave them over there and then you are

850
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:48,130
completely looking to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of</font>

851
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:50,500
OpenStack because the extensions are for

852
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,020
a certain version what did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we do</font>

853
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,650
we have contributed this to the

854
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,390
OpenStack upstream we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

855
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:01,840
those extensions as part of the kilo

00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,250

don't be afraid has no OpenStack and you

will be the bold ones that are dealing

00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">orchestrator on your manager for</font>

867
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,490
vertical integration for our lab we

868
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,610
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was possible to make it a</font>

869
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:41,529
little bit better let better structure

870
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:43,630
so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize we dealing</font>

871
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">with OpenStack theory the first thing</font>

872
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:49,030
the first way we thought it was not the

873
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,720
the right way so we created our own them

874
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,100
and we plan to converge though there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

875
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:00,129
something internal discussions that

876
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:02,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe may have some sense even in the</font>

877
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,180
future even if we converse with with

878
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,160
with the OpenStack may have some sense

879
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,480
because it's much more lightweight it's

880
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,759
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full-fledged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shopping sake sir</font>

881
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,400
it's a very tiny one and for certain

882
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,620
environments we believe that could make

883
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,260
sense for example we have been talking

884
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,819
with some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

885
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,120
precisely what is called built<font color="#CCCCCC"> ocp</font>

886
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:25,030
devito CP for enterprises and that they

887
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,730
are now trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> base in there are some</font>

888
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas about having a some kind of split</font>

889
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,440
so to have some part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cpe still in</font>

890
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,990
the customer premises and to have to

891
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,840
some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CP in the inductor on</font>

892
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:40,959
the cloud and in those cases maybe there

893
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,900
is a tiny orchestration stack could have

894
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">two could have some merit in the piece</font>

895
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,860
small piece that you live at the other

896
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:50,230
customer premises this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

897
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,090
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are thinking about this is something</font>

898
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you play with it</font>

899
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:58,210
you have an idea of how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

900
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,890
be great to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some input back from</font>

901
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:03,160
from from the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see whether</font>

902
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:07,180
you see any value in the whole thing in

903
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:12,910
keeping these these tiny bang or

904
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:14,560
whatever i'm done i hope in time so if

905
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,890
you have any questions that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

please tell us what you mean by career

918
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:56,099
class behavior thing I bet by Caltrans

919
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,440
behavior we mean here precisely

920
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:02,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that provides a performance</font>

921
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:05,729
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is acceptable for our operational</font>

922
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,049
guys to substitute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the physical</font>

923
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:09,058
functions for the virtual functions

924
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,130
first and second and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mostly most</font>

925
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:14,039
importantly precisely so then that

926
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,930
provide a consistent performance that

927
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:19,489
wherever you make a deployment you know

928
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:23,038
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get 10 gigs 10 max</font>

929
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:24,599
1k but always the same because our

930
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,700
experience with it with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vanilla</font>

931
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,249
cloud it was waterfront over to some

932
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:32,879
time was it was one key something that

933
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:34,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clouds the management system was</font>

934
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,509
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> us it was the same deployment</font>

935
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:40,769
exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> from time it was</font>

936
00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:42,479
thinking 10 megs 100 megs 150 and that

937
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:46,169
was something that it was not acceptable

938
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:50,308
because for our operational guys would

939
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:52,229
kill us simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in Canberra jacobsen</font>

940
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:53,940
university wisconsin<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm really excited</font>

941
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:55,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go try this I've spent a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

942
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,049
fighting trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get good performance</font>

943
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,749
out of OpenStack<font color="#CCCCCC"> and open V switch with</font>

944
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:02,219
middleboxes and it's just not happening

945
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:05,218
so one question quick question I had is

946
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:06,599
that how does as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

947
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:08,309
about doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like service</font>

948
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,430
function chaining we're after you pass

949
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:13,229
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> one NF you want to go to many</font>

950
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">different ones how does the number of</font>

951
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,598
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you're splitting your</font>

952
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:19,319
traffic ultimately impact the

953
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,739
performance of switching so far the we

954
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:25,589
are starting to go to the training do we

955
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:28,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean very few we are very much focused</font>

956
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:29,788
on a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of projects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we have</font>

957
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,920
been assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very tight schedule to</font>

958
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:33,089
show that this can deliver so we are

959
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,249
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on something that is</font>

960
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:38,729
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this home brutalization Don</font>

961
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:40,468
was mentioning before and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they set</font>

962
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">the service training is very limited i</font>

963
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:43,390
would say we're talking

964
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:46,540
not more than three four functions right

965
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:48,370
now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have plans and well right now</font>

966
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,020
this teaching of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the functions is done</font>

967
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:53,080
through the directly through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

968
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:55,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">flow controller in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of em we have</font>

969
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,330
plans to explore the deal for general a

970
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,430
function chaining later on so this is

971
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:02,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that and well if you if you</font>

972
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,980
won't do somehow things about to help to

973
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:07,030
merge these with a opening f<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

974
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:16,780
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that would be really</font>

975
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:21,040
interested to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so now Oh role</font>

976
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this Katie I can't go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font>

977
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:29,470
please like or in this case no that's it

978
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:32,259
no better direction or for this one yes

979
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:37,750
exactly I finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit this correctly</font>

980
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:40,210
you are using dpd k yeah so well<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PDK</font>

981
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,670
are there any issues so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

982
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,880
are there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues with isolation in</font>

983
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:48,070
this case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> II they were not they were</font>

984
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,740
issues with isolation they were issues

985
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:53,890
but what I'm forgot to mention as we are

986
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:57,459
using a modified get dirt as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

987
00:47:53,890 --> 00:48:02,650
so the deal is that you are saying

988
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:05,110
because one of the tricks here that for

989
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:08,200
each kind of process<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a set of</font>

990
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:09,730
resources assigned this is I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

991
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,279
we are forcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit pushing down</font>

992
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stack some of the brutalization to</font>

993
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,810
achieve this sustainable and predictable

994
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,050
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you're basically</font>

995
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:22,360
also limited by the number of course

996
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:24,730
when going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy when going to</font>

997
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,520
deploy a function in the data plane yes

998
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:30,670
yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact is that you can</font>

999
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,550
choose whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go data plane</font>

1000
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">style or you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go control all the</font>

1001
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:41,080
other playing style case you take it you

1002
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,990
will allow me<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you'll allow me to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cut</font>

1003
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,690
the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> because otherwise bumi but we</font>

1004
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:50,799
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> check yeah it's fine we'll discuss</font>

1005
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:52,840
up yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so woman let me</font>

1006
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,200
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me make play the chair come here and</font>

1007
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,200
so

1008
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,890
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see I'm not dr. Moore my</font>

1009
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:16,480
name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> GUI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> professionally I'll be doing</font>

1010
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the presentation on behalf of him so if</font>

1011
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,140
you have any questions or comments or

1012
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,330
suggestion I suggest you send<font color="#CCCCCC"> us the</font>

1013
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution list you can ask me some of</font>

1014
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:27,730
the questions and try to answer but

1015
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:30,220
maybe are not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

1016
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,370
so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked this question to</font>

1017
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:36,879
the other what he means<font color="#E5E5E5"> by careers class</font>

1018
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:39,609
because every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk about NFV and</font>

1019
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,530
virtualization the traditional service

1020
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:46,690
providers they ask us this question can

1021
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:49,210
we expect the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior and</font>

1022
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,940
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers expect or we expect from</font>

1023
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:59,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tradition like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PhD and our carrier</font>

1024
00:49:51,940 --> 00:50:01,810
grade equipment so you can set up a test

1025
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,190
bed or you can run simulation or you can

1026
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">develop analytical model there are</font>

1027
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:09,460
varieties<font color="#CCCCCC"> of way to solve this problem</font>

1028
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,900
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next few minutes are we talking</font>

1029
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,790
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going through some of the</font>

1030
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,730
selected slides not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the slides if</font>

1031
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:18,070
you are interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the details of the</font>

1032
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,770
development of the model analysis there

1033
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,970
is a reference to journal papers which

1034
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,910
we have published in the GT

1035
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:27,430
communications mera jee that's a

1036
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,200
shortened version of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire report</font>

1037
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,940
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more than hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pages but you</font>

1038
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,970
will get the idea of how these things

1039
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:37,330
are being developed so i'll be talking

1040
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:41,919
about the reliability of energy using

1041
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:43,660
courts common of the shelf hardware so

1042
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,520
the outline is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the difference</font>

1043
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,529
between traditional telecom demand

1044
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,360
hardware and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> common of the shell and</font>

1045
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:52,120
we will talk about the analysis

1046
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:55,870
framework as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say it is simulation and</font>

1047
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,880
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Markov chain model like anybody who</font>

1048
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:59,830
has done state transition diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1049
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,930
will start with short and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font>

1050
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep on adding the transition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states the</font>

1051
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,118
state's explode at some point you have

1052
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:07,999
to limit it because they

1053
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,650
becomes unmanageable and then we'll talk

1054
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:12,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the enhancing application</font>

1055
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,539
reliability by<font color="#CCCCCC"> our backups traditionally</font>

1056
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">people try to do one for one back up 14</font>

1057
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:19,519
to back up but the point is if you keep

1058
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:23,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">on adding the backup servers it adds the</font>

1059
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:28,910
complexity but the marginal gain it's

1060
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:31,190
not as I as you expect so instead of 141

1061
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:34,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">backup we have 14 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backup or if you</font>

1062
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:37,640
have shared operation so you can see how

1063
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change that's we also</font>

1064
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:42,589
included in the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we'll</font>

1065
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:45,619
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the results next like</font>

1066
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:47,450
this so the traditional telecom harder

1067
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:49,400
as you know they have strong fall

1068
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,259
detection and fault isolation capability

1069
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,599
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other level because the harbor's</font>

1070
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:55,789
have been hardened to operate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1071
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,619
harsh conditions and well-established

1072
00:51:55,789 --> 00:52:00,380
tradition on software upgrade and

1073
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:03,049
patching anybody who has experienced on

1074
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,339
PhD and switches or network you know

1075
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:06,829
that they have scheduled maintenance

1076
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:08,480
window at 3m in the morning for half an

1077
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:11,660
hour or something like that when the

1078
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic is very low and then reliability</font>

1079
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,660
of the central of fish is assumed that

1080
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:20,839
means five<font color="#E5E5E5"> nines of availability like</font>

1081
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:24,078
call completion time is within certain

1082
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:26,269
limit and also the quality of the data

1083
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,579
plane control plane and also half times

1084
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:30,729
this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be significantly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high now in</font>

1085
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:33,259
the course hardware so they may have

1086
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,809
smaller mean time between failure and

1087
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:37,789
the mean time to repair and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cots</font>

1088
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:39,499
procedure for software upgrade and

1089
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:41,690
patching and maintenance those are not

1090
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:43,939
oil scheduled or oil establish time

1091
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,009
window so the different grade of

1092
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,670
reliability for different data centers

1093
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:51,170
so we looked at the MC<font color="#E5E5E5"> TI a one of the</font>

1094
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">specification they have defined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

1095
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:57,260
types so what we did we took those four

1096
00:52:54,410 --> 00:53:00,710
types of description and then we more

1097
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:05,330
those next like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1098
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have seven minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font>

1099
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:10,160
can go to the main point so the main

1100
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,259
points basically is the gods procedure

1101
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,990
for software<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade and patching those</font>

1102
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,670
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the main culprit because if</font>

1103
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,549
those things are unpredictable you will

1104
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:21,740
see that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> side down time for type 1</font>

1105
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:24,110
type 2 type 3 and five for data centers

1106
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,459
it can vary from ninety nine point six

1107
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:28,670
seven one two ninety-nine point nine

1108
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:31,060
nine five which is almost 59 which is

1109
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional the carrier grade yeah</font>

1110
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:39,200
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the traditional 141 back up</font>

1111
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:42,410
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and next so in this one you can</font>

1112
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,569
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system availability is p1 times</font>

1113
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,549
p2 which is the p1 is this availability

1114
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:48,980
of the left side block platform and the

1115
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:52,040
p24 the right side and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connectivity</font>

1116
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:55,130
also contribute to the reliability and

1117
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,130
availability next one so is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it possible</font>

1118
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:01,310
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have servers with 49 or even three</font>

1119
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:03,170
lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reliability and ability to</font>

1120
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:05,540
provide the five lines so the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1121
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:08,030
yes but the marginal gains becomes low

1122
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:13,730
as you keep on adding more servers next

1123
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:15,350
one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is 141</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back up next so</font>

1124
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,840
this one as you can see one primary

1125
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,400
backup on secondary backup but the point

1126
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,350
is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the synchronization of</font>

1127
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,570
the master with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slave server one</font>

1128
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:25,130
which is back up one and in addition you

1129
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:27,530
have to do the synchronization of the

1130
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,960
slave server back up to with the master

1131
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well so it adds additional complexity</font>

1132
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,460
because you have two backups and the

1133
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,470
pepper I was mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> is available in</font>

1134
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,360
this URL anybody interested you can go

1135
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,160
and download the pepper and as I said

1136
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this paper is a shortened version of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1137
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">big report anybody interested send an</font>

1138
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:48,950
email to the distribution list we can

1139
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">share the little people with you next so</font>

1140
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:52,819
this is marginally better than the one

1141
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,470
back up and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is running the</font>

1142
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,170
third option is running the load sharing

1143
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:59,299
mode so every time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests come you</font>

1144
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,440
can round<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in between the first serve</font>

1145
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,770
our second server things like that

1146
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:07,520
fraction so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is same as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one for one</font>

1147
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:09,420
back and the next one so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the</font>

1148
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,530
load sharing mode

1149
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,640
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same as</font>

1150
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:17,500
also one map so as I said the detailed

1151
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,210
results and analysis simulation and

1152
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:24,490
analytical results you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find in this</font>

1153
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:25,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">pepper which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in this URL next next so</font>

1154
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,790
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the school markup straight</font>

1155
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:29,890
through state Markov model the server is

1156
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:32,680
good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current master and the</font>

1157
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,810
server is bad so this is typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1158
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition model so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1159
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:40,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">simplest model and then when you add the</font>

1160
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,609
complexity next so intermediate States

1161
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:46,060
the silent error probability so in this

1162
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:48,400
case the s1 and s2 one server is good on

1163
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,650
several said and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this trend</font>

1164
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,390
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the transition probability to</font>

1165
00:55:50,650 --> 00:56:00,040
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mathematical model next one</font>

1166
00:55:52,390 --> 00:56:05,200
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as you can see as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep</font>

1167
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:06,700
on adding the servers and if the the

1168
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,189
server mean time between failure and the

1169
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,470
silent error probability you increase

1170
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:16,960
this one as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1171
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:21,399
server with 69 so you can achieve those

1172
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,560
kind of availability next one yeah so

1173
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,050
with the mean time to repair<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also</font>

1174
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">as I said before the improvement in</font>

1175
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:31,060
significant it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not as significant so</font>

1176
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,550
with five backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see mean time</font>

1177
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:36,340
to repair 12 minutes and six minute with

1178
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:39,100
10 so the improvement is not as

1179
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,230
significant next one so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

1180
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the simulation results not much</font>

1181
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,900
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we go out from</font>

1182
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:48,009
the analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also from the</font>

1183
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:51,130
simulation next so again improvement for

1184
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:53,410
1 plus to dwell back up please as you

1185
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:55,150
can see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve improvement</font>

1186
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,580
deteriorates fast with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> island error</font>

1187
00:56:55,150 --> 00:57:01,240
not significant influence is not as

1188
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:03,400
significant as it was before next<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1189
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,140
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the before metal starts for no</font>

1190
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,490
fault you have do the synchronization

1191
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:11,529
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> simpler one with the Sun to</font>

1192
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:13,419
next one yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dresser one</font>

1193
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,580
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the mush runs late and the</font>

1194
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:18,430
dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> center be could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in maintenance</font>

1195
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:20,319
mode with other application and the

1196
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:23,980
after maintenance starts reverting when

1197
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:26,200
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no fault next so this impact of</font>

1198
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,730
the site maintenance is negligible again

1199
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,259
this is based on the state transition

1200
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:33,940
diagram and<font color="#CCCCCC"> developing on the equation</font>

1201
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:36,840
and solving them next next so these are

1202
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:39,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the four types of data center we</font>

1203
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:42,670
considered in the first one single non

1204
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,920
redundant and the reliability is 99.6 71

1205
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:47,080
in the second one we have redundant

1206
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,240
component that means the capacity has

1207
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,340
some additional capacity available you

1208
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">can achieve reliability of 19 and 17 for</font>

1209
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">one in the third one you have redundant</font>

1210
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,790
component and also redundant

1211
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,920
connectivity IT equipment so in the

1212
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:02,200
fourth one it means all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

1213
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,960
second and third requirement in addition

1214
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it has standby power supply so in case</font>

1215
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power supply fails you can have</font>

1216
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,430
additional power supplies the fourth or

1217
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:10,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">incite infrastructure with electric</font>

1218
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,879
power storage and distribution

1219
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:15,040
facilities and this one can achieve up

1220
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> knightdale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4995 which is very close</font>

transition state transition diagram

1223
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,470
model you can get the more details in

1224
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,150
from the pepper which we have put and

1225
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,779
this is the service impact error

1226
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:31,630
probability for various data center next

1227
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,800
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it is possible to provide five</font>

1228
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,050
nines of reliability and availability

1229
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,990
with God's hardware with the application

1230
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,540
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact of the mean</font>

1231
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:42,459
time to repair is not as significant if

1232
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:45,759
it is reasonably<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve for example less</font>

1233
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:47,410
than 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> next so the impact of</font>

1234
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,480
the data center scheduled maintenance is

1235
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:51,700
also negligible so the cost procedure

1236
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,890
for software upgrade patching they do

1237
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">not contribute significantly so the</font>

1238
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,299
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is different grade of reliability</font>

1239
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,100
for data center can be achieved and 59

1240
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">so available availability can also be</font>

1241
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,089
achieved using type 3 and the type for

1242
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,160
data centers where you have additional

connectivity capacity and in the type

1244
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,049
for you have a redundant capacity

redundant connectivity and standby power
