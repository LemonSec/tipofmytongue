00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,620
for Mike line management please use the

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,559
Front's Mike here I guess that's

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible and feel free you know move</font>

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,109
closer yeah so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did the</font>

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,230
count based on the video critic

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:28,740
discussion I know I don't know I could

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a we have a note taker and we</font>

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,210
have a jabber scribe correct fingers to

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,730
note takers in a jabber scrap caught you

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,530
guys are good and the blue sheets are

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:51,269
being distributed right now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:55,440
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when they come by so basically</font>

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,270
we had the things in blue up here the

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
things that we've got left a little

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,540
agenda bash we have working group last

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,580
call resolutions it's basically all the

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,810
security issues so a little bit it's

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,479
probably gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 20 minutes for us</font>

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,149
and then we have three other drafts to

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,380
discuss and I guess Ted you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you said</font>

21
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:11,700
we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to swap some orders and</font>

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,979
now I can't remember what we were in a

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,979
swap or 20 suggesting we do return

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,200
before so we're suggesting you do return

25
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:25,549
before stp any objections alright cool

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,539
cool anybody wanna have anything else

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:33,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so without further ado Martin is</font>

28
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:36,390
here right excellent

29
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,000
I uploaded the version you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent me the</font>

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,440
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Martin so I guess basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,110
happened was we put the security arts

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">draft out of working group out of the</font>

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,750
working group with the ad and then we

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">found some oops we need to pull it back</font>

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,500
so these are the beginnings of looking

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,450
at them i just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point out also</font>

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
that Bernard took all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open issues</font>

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,550
that he was aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what he went</font>

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,979
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and put in the issue</font>

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,030
tracker so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hope is that you know so</font>

41
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,850
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things in the</font>

42
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,950
issue tracker on me at the ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,720
related to the RTC by working group so

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,100
we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and like yeah we cover</font>

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,890
this yeah we cover this and just kind of

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,959
knock them all out I didn't realize I

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,760
was looking for that but that happened I

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,950
look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emails I think I got most</font>

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,049
of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not correct me if I miss</font>

50
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,049
anything and we can we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over quickly</font>

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:33,420
sorry apologize that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> return this one</font>

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,420
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a brown yeah</font>

53
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:44,590
as we all go through my email it's got

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,590
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,330
I have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> uploaded this so it is</font>

56
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually i'ma be interesting okay thanks</font>

57
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,540
Martin next let's just all right so it

58
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,450
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> observed that we don't actually tell</font>

59
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,079
people what hash algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use for</font>

60
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:06,049
the a vehicle fingerprint line so i am

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,319
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that we mandate the use</font>

62
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,269
of shower 256 and allow people to use

63
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:16,730
char one for the for the near future

64
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:18,380
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> i recommend that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get it in our</font>

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,018
heads that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn this off</font>

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,500
at some time in the in the near future

67
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:30,890
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite as bad as it might have</font>

68
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">been with say regular CA certs we're</font>

69
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,910
generating in these certificates and

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,640
throwing them away on relatively short

71
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:44,200
time scales and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd actually carry</font>

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,200
any significant credential white but I

73
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,269
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want char one so yeah some go</font>

74
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,650
ahead sorry pornography yeah so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

75
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,700
come up my understanding is that

76
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:58,310
existing implementations generally

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,850
offers shelter physics but also could

78
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,230
validate<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-1 and shall 512 I think I</font>

79
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,530
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is correct I think we might</font>

80
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:09,590
also accept 384<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i sell-- don't</font>

81
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,060
remember exactly yeah if if that's true

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,459
or some subset of that's true it might

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,190
make sense to just say that as what

84
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,320
people ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do like generate 256 but</font>

85
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:23,360
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to validate the stuff that</font>

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,820
people could validate oh yeah um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,020
the may<font color="#CCCCCC"> own shell 1 is validation only</font>

88
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,919
yes Russell<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't make any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

89
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's may only on the validation</font>

90
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,719
somebody's got to be producing it well

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,240
yeah this would be web RTC compatible

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,270
devices solo go go go boy anyway that's

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what I got up here to say yup Russ</font>

94
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Housley vigil security rather than</font>

95
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,500
having to do this later document why

96
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:59,500
don't you say should not use sha-1

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:02,120
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> someday yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really different</font>

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,970
we're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we only really need</font>

99
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,930
to say validate in this context for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

100
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,250
one so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read it you're saying</font>

101
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,930
may do either now yeah sending and

102
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,660
validation is that not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meant</font>

103
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,650
let's just strikes sending for fish are

104
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,200
one I don't think there's any case for a

105
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,780
modern compliant web RTC device to be

106
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a shower or just taken very high</font>

107
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,750
yeah I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a question you won't you</font>

108
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,729
well the question is what do all the

109
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,560
legacy devices do not what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browsers</font>

110
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:40,310
do well that's that's why I'm suggesting

111
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,800
validation well let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some safe we</font>

112
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,940
can get some clarity out of this guy

113
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,380
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like the worst document</font>

114
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,940
anybody's are written like like you

115
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,980
should be embarrassed our copy this

116
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:54,530
document is ha ha ha ha thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I</font>

117
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:00,290
take forward by diving it right I mean

118
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:03,229
like um exactly um so I guess I'll just

119
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,479
take a step<font color="#E5E5E5"> back rather than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being sort</font>

120
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,360
of boo hiss about the but about the

121
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,430
these these types right let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

122
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,110
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask we're trying to achieve so</font>

123
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:17,930
um the if we're going to operate with

124
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,220
older versions we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to at</font>

125
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,790
least for some reasonable period both

126
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,400
except in<font color="#CCCCCC"> generate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-1 generate yeah</font>

127
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,830
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o because those</font>

128
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">things take shower right 900 x and by</font>

129
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and by the way like yeah I</font>

130
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,680
they're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna require by the</font>

131
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,450
way some modification in the JavaScript

132
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,800
to like strip out probably sure brother

133

<font color="#CCCCCC">Raju 2610 bet people won't handle</font>

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,760
multiple fingerprints very well but

135
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's at least JavaScript fix so no big</font>

136
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,860
deal right on yeah that's probably right

137
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">too because because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the 45</font>

138
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,060
whatever it is 45 70 x occasion that I

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">screwed that one out yeah um so but I'm</font>

140
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:00,410
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what the on you</font>

141
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,430
know what what is the given that there's

142
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:06,729
like like next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> no progress on I'm</font>

145
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,880
rationale for like being all negative

146
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:17,330
about shot one right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think</font>

147
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,990
the concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> here was simply a pre-image</font>

148
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,280
attack wasn't it all the Lang work was

149
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,830
with collisions there's been ever

150
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,630
basically no nation in this car so it

151
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,450
would be sufficient wouldn't huh a

152
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,600
collision would be sufficient I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did on a</font>

153
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,900
collision in the full certificate well

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,100
in it so the self-signed certificates

155
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,200
right a collision would not be

156
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">sufficient because why would you because</font>

157
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">because why would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you generate two</font>

158
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,419
certificates with the same digest

159
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,240
different keys how will be incented yet

160
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,100
so in order how collision what you would

161
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,960
need would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a context in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which you're</font>

162
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,010
using a certain well well then if you

163
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,390
actually have the private key for the

164
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,010
one that you generate a coalition for

165
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,159
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that wait a second the</font>

166
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,900
zone so in this case right the person

167
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,480
who's producing the fingerprint is the

168
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,219
person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> made the server right so a</font>

169
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,960
collision attack requires making to

170
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,720
search with making intrusion at the same

171
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,750
time with the same fingerprint right and

172
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,880
so um since you're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person doing that</font>

173
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,760
why would you produce one that to the

174
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">delighted so um something the only case</font>

175
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,210
i can think of the relevant would be one

176
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,159
in which someone which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using</font>

177
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,840
third-party issued certs and you just

178
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,280
and someone somehow convince a third

179
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,469
party<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give them to</font>

180
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,179
give them the same certificate that they

181
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,740
gave somebody else I suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

182
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:42,469
possible and I in trouble for how it's

183
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:45,470
likely to happen if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

184
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,690
the must not later I think you should

185
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:53,150
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> your dates as opposed to saying I'm</font>

186
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:55,400
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redo the RFC so back to some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

187
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,829
the logic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Eric was starting on</font>

188
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,840
which is there's the stuff you have to

189
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to validate right and so the</font>

190
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,500
legacy guys probably going to send your

191
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,010
shell one so you really must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

192
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,750
validate<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you if we're going to say</font>

193
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,920
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> shot 256 is what you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use by</font>

194
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,530
default you have to be able to elevate

195
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,540
that as well and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only remaining</font>

196
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,449
question is should you force people to

197
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,740
validate sha-512 or should it should be

198
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,280
something lower right

199
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,570
so that's validation and then generation

200
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eric made the argument they should be</font>

201
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,770
able to generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-1 and 256 because</font>

202
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,330
that's the preferred one and I guess the

203
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:35,010
only other question is should you be

204
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:37,490
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate 512 well what's come up</font>

205
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,510
here and tell them exactly what to do I

206
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,630
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's anything we really</font>

207
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,700
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about it additional hashes</font>

208
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:48,090
in addition to these you may generate

209
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,030
them you may validate them yes I mean

210
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,950
think the the minimum operating a minute

211
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,449
interoperability profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

212
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,730
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> back the minimum at my upper body</font>

213
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,480
profile for WebRTC should be charged a

214
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,010
56 and so we absolutely require every

215
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,330
destruction 56 presence we want and

216
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,860
because something we make the turn off

217
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,510
sha-1 Jerry invalidate right and and in

218
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,370
terms of the interview profile for older

219
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,689
things that's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shot one for now</font>

220
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,550
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see how we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get around</font>

221
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,340
requiring that if you want to work um

222
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,719
and so maybe the future shy when we

223
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,580
really busted and we'll hope you'll stop

224
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,900
accepting it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully we'll have</font>

225
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,270
enough warning that people can upgrade

226
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,829
their other their legacy endpoints but I

227
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I just like I would prefer</font>

228
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">respective Jays only them that's not</font>

229
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,480
seeing how we do that in the environment

230
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,980
with existing crap that does sha wan I

231
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,540
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is Gustav does now he's going</font>

232
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it um we can check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into what</font>

233
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,370
the status of that is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know but</font>

234
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">my guess as an individual contributor is</font>

235
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,750
you know expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst so I was it if</font>

236
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,850
we can make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

237
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,500
convince ourselves that we convince

238
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,200
ourselves that there was only a finite

239
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,230
amount of legacy equipment and that that

240
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,370
could somehow be fixed um you know i'd

241
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">be willing to convention schedule for</font>

242
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,010
deprecating sha-1 but I mean I again

243
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,859
like absent any again<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. presenter</font>

244
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,360
research obsolete any evidence of a pre

245
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,640
image or an analysis source of collision

246
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,930
as a problem in this case I like like I

247
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,870
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe a little premature to be</font>

248
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,380
like trying to deprecate shot one<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

249
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">right must on both I think we're getting</font>

250
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,630
to Jonathan XO I'm reminded me we'd

251
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,730
deprecated the old rule that's used the

252
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,470
same hash algorithm that's the

253
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,480
certificate itself uses no one has

254
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,070
deprecated that I've an internet draft

255
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,649
on that and yes I was about to bring

256
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point</font>

257
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright if you have legacy equipment</font>

258
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,899
that actually does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean are there</font>

259
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,220
in fact rules about what hashes you can

260
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,999
use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the detail I certificates</font>

261
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,499
themselves because the should align even

262
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,839
if we're correct changing those i

263
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:52,389
believe i<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that the</font>

264
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,420
recommendation there applies also to the

265
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:59,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">generation of the certificate so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

266
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,209
again interrupt with no one but me good

267
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,579
should but most activities for your own

268
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think i think for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the purposes of this</font>

269
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:09,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to have to pick one because</font>

270
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,279
that's how certificates work and we have

271
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:17,050
chosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256 if anyone out there is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">validating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-1 and expects that to</font>

273
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,410
also be the same hash that's used in the

274
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,050
generation in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> creation of a</font>

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,179

276
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,758
I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be all that said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

277
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,649
that so we also have a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

278
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,920
actually says it recommends not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

279
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,749
sha-1 in a signature based algorithm so

280
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,040
we'd have to I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> so fingerprints it's</font>

281
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:38,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">different in figure printed in a</font>

that a certificate was shot with that d

00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,129
pls with the if the pier presents a

step back the signature that's on the

290
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,350
certificate that we present<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here is</font>

291
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,699
completely immaterial the only question

292
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,579
is whether or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone's actually</font>

293
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:08,290
doing unnecessary validation on that

294
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:10,899
certificate and choking as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

295
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,660
what it sees that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright if there's</font>

296
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:18,459
md 2 in the certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> i propose we</font>

297
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:22,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">accept it so I I guess here's we can you</font>

298
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:27,189
know sure here's just result this um so

299
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:28,839
um is it um i postulate that nobody in

300
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:31,149
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> in force of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rule about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

301
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,069
hash hours would be the same and so

302
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:36,519
unless somebody tells me unless I here

303
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:37,899
pretty soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they that they um that</font>

304
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone that's not the case I pros we</font>

305
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,390
said we were wrong

306
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,730
and then and that would leave you so

307
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,140
Riley you still can even if even if the

308
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,910
rule remains youth during multiple

309
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,199
certificates just be a pansy ass right

310
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,390
um how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know which one to send um</font>

311
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,920
i would assume though that the other

312
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,650
side would have to match up against one

313
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,680
right even if you've got multiple

314
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,780
certificates you don't know which that

315
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,449
the other guys not validating the has

316
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,890
validated the certificate you know went

317
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,390
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that you you're offering it</font>

318
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,460
in the DC LS handshake that's true

319
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,490
either case because of the yeah because

320
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,060
because the ECE Seaver<font color="#CCCCCC"> start a issue we</font>

railroads to write on so many yes sorry

324
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,370
the need for I've posed I've Rosalie

different haven't had the same algorithm

327
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,660
and we on and we remain mostly silent

328
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,270
about what what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface should be</font>

329
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,050
signed with um but both I mean I say

330
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,430
repose<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256 it should be but like they</font>

331
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,469
also you're not supposed to check out or

332
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,640
something yeah um<font color="#CCCCCC"> although maybe I'd be</font>

333
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,990
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you should check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to be</font>

334
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,760
reasonably modern cuz like putting in

335
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,110
like md2 would not be really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

336
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine it's just another king of time kind</font>

337
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird right I mean do what you want I</font>

338
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,610
don't think the biggest secure um so um

339
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,930
and you can maybe insecure but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to secure in the context of the cell</font>

science service you're not checking but

342
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,680
um and so um and but then also say you

343
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,550
must must do both<font color="#CCCCCC"> charlotte to bchi wand</font>

344
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> called it a dip okay so we're saying</font>

345
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,589
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can send multiple able</font>

347
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,950
ok we will have to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and we</font>

348
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,260
know that legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> could walk up on that</font>

349
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,580
we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

350
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,410
take a punt on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they assume it will</font>

351
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,140
but like that you can pat other<font color="#CCCCCC"> parts of</font>

352
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're get will take that</font>

353
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,040
gamble I think you saw was a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

354
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,900
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna have to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next you</font>

355
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,459
know Google and Google and we're gonna

356
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,230
spend the next like like four months<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

357
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">winding this because I I know we didn't</font>

358
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,430
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> too vigorous or a long town ok</font>

359
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:44,610
youtube later I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused what</font>

360
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:50,979
what dtls srtp legacy equipment

361
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:53,080
okay here comes that's good and if you

362
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,220
if you can't if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for the same</font>

363
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:00,220
hash rule is if you can't parse the hash

364
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:05,560
off of the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you won't be</font>

365
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate anyway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no so</font>

366
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,430
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the logic of the same hatch</font>

367
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,800
rule in sdp right use the same hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

368
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,300
to generate the fingerprint in sdp as

369
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,770
you did in the certificate itself so you

370
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,540
only need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know one hash function if</font>

371
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,710
you can't read it out of the SDP then

372
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:26,140
you won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to understand it in</font>

373
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:27,550
the certificate anyway cryptographically

374
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,110
it doesn't matter but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

375
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,250
can actually parks the certificate you

376
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,350
can all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we got like six minutes</font>

377
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">left for this whole poem okay look I</font>

378
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,260
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to go play with this entice</font>

379
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,660
a little bit cone jetting<font color="#E5E5E5"> start as an</font>

380
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,760
individual contributor I but I mean if

381
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,199
we're going to break backwards

382
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,680
compatibility with equipment that

383
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">correctly implements the rfcs that we've</font>

384
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,099
published without believing that we need

385
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:55,839
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and update those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rfcs to fix them</font>

386
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to complain like the app</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

387
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,950
no security gain that just doesn't sound

388
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,180
right to me so I mean I'm game to fix

389
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,040
this and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have it right</font>

390
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,959
okay where should it should be clear the

391
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,670
reason the primary reason we multiple

392
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,709
fingerprints is not for multiple hash

393
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:12,300
algorithms it's your multiple and some

394
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,300
will public key signature algorithms

395
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:23,350
right on Shey so is there an update to

396
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,659
the RFC we we will we will take action

397
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,280
interview<font color="#CCCCCC"> one yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's</font>

398
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,170
work through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and figure it out</font>

399
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,090
but this is sounding like I'm not your

400
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,620
choice to make your equipment right I'm

401
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,139
well I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the effort not</font>

402
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,520
to excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the only thing I would</font>

403
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,930
add about the sha-1 is if we leave it in

404
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,790
there we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a consideration say</font>

405
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,150
we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fingerprint purpose so</font>

406
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:47,170
like leave us alone security guys yeah

407
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:49,840
well we will do that and and I do

408
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,850
actually have a draft updating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> April</font>

409
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,429
fingerprint doc that deals with the

410
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,709
issue of hash agility and and and this

411
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,420
certificate issue so I can resurrect

412
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,550
that and send us a list if that's what

413
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,690
people want right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's fun I can</font>

414
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:08,050
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the long explanation on this</font>

415
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,850
one Oh apart from them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be going</font>

416
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">with most emotional work something</font>

417
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,040
unsend at the list there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

418
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,240
who have the state in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their heads okay</font>

419
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,590
so um Magnus noted this this issue I

420
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,910
don't know if Magnus was paying

421
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,129
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the blogs and various other</font>

422
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,080
things at the time that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was away but</font>

423
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,580
this turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a bit of a who are</font>

424
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,379
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet and people got</font>

425
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,500
really excited a bit about this exact

426
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,550
issue and we have a bug that's quite

427
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,810
kind of interesting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> read feel free</font>

428
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Justin will probably have some view on</font>

429
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,690
this one I've got the next slide which

430
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:50,080
is probably more interesting to people

431
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:51,760
so we closed this issue before maybe we

432
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,050
fail to document it maybe maybe that's

433
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,060
true maybe that's an action that we have

434
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,280
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out of this notice my proposal</font>

435
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,850
doesn't actually suggest that we do

436
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,830
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concern risers are arises</font>

437
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,149
from out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

438
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,370
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if they're using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a VPN</font>

439
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,730
for privacy purposes we're like spraying

440
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:16,689
their IP addresses all over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

441
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,720
and exposes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lant apology even users who</font>

442
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,929
aren't concerned about using these VPN

443
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,910
devices the concern is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browsers</font>

444
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">are unable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to properly distinguish</font>

445
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:31,390
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a network where the</font>

446
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,928
topology should be hidden and a network

447
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:38,440
that where the topology is simply you

448
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:42,549
know how the topology is and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

449
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,799
are on say a normal VPN really do want

450
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,900
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situations to be able to use</font>

451
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,418
their local network to make their phone

452
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,880
calls and and what not and don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

453
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,130
pay the<font color="#CCCCCC"> price</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trombone that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

454
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,730
their media traffic all the way back

455
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,530
back home so we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and the</font>

456
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,960
other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other point here that has been</font>

457
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,299
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of point the number of</font>

458
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,950
times that people seem to not appreciate

459
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well is if you actually care about</font>

460
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,059
your privacy you actually have to take

461
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,189
considerably more steps than just

462
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:16,059
turning on a VPN people don't realize

463
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:18,640
this but you know when when people

464
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,918
shipped or they turn off things like web

465
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,630
RTC right because they understand

466
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,140
exactly this sorta and they turn off

467
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:29,410
JavaScript I mean yeah I mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

468
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are needed in order to get proper</font>

469
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,600
privacy protection firm nice exam and my

470
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,970
proposal here was to leave this to the

471
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,290
browsers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Magnus notes that we should</font>

472
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,580
probably document the fact that we are

473
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:45,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing so Justin so um I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

474
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,460
that we missed in the first go-round on

475
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,110
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> our only I missed is a you know we</font>

476
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,070
all kind of knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the local</font>

477
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,809
addresses would be service to the

478
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,730
browser but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't aware of the fact</font>

479
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:57,040
that if you're in a multi-homed case or

480
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can have multiple active routes that</font>

481
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,790
you can actually you know send stun out

482
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,668
that second route you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the if you</font>

483
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,809
have a VPN tunnel you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you actually</font>

484
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,580
might have stuff going at the public IP

485
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:09,070
stuff and you might find out the public

486
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,110
IP which is distinct from the you know

487
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,330
the VPN IP and that's what people really

488
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,500
got upset about instead of the fact that

489
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,500
you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home</font>

490
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,700
situation I think that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

491
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,770
might be somewhat novel since the last

492
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,790
time we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

493
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,650
you know the original part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

494
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,980
should we have turned only mode I don't

495
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,169
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

496
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,340
to go to that extreme pneus because

497
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,730
really the main thing you want to do is

498
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,770
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that nothing is surface to the</font>

499
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,070
outside other than what the web server

500
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,780
car DC and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did in</font>

501
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,090
chrome to solve this was basically have

502
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,440
a mode where when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bind you don't</font>

503
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,629
bind every interface you just bind to

504
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the any address and so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can still get</font>

505
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,530
stung candidates just fine you took a

506
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:48,520
turn candidates just fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

507
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,649
to limit yourself to just turn

508
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,750
candidates it's just yeah you don't give

509
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,460
out any look like he's and don't give

510
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,169
out anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that wouldn't be found</font>

511
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,910
through going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the default route and</font>

512
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:02,380
so what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that this</font>

513
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:03,880
document is that the solution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

514
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,190
people agree this is a good solution we

515
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,590
kind of document this isn't like you

516
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,880
know if you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trade-offs</font>

517
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,799
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

518
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,440
sort of optimized for this is the

519
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,820
approach that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend all rights I</font>

520
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,650
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump in it we had 20</font>

521
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,090
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> allotted for this we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

522
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,500
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going though and kind of short</font>

523
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,610
change the non working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts at</font>

524
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,679
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

525
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,899
important than we try these home so go

526
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,860
ahead sorry oh hi to all this trouble

527
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:34,600
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the report I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

528
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:37,689
seen this one single VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> product for the</font>

529
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,750
mac that causes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the causes the local</font>

530
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,210
address to be revealed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not seen</font>

531
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:46,059
it happened with any any other way p

532
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,970
answer that it's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a place</font>

533
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">where people don't go in a wild panics</font>

534
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,110
about this

535
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:01,149
so I think think that that Justin had

536
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,100
the right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on this bit we are on</font>

537
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:04,449
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> comic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my slightly more concrete</font>

538
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,119
version of us disposal is which is

539
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,379
docking with the sis<font color="#E5E5E5"> dative plight and</font>

540
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,879
document what you could do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order in</font>

541
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:12,158
order if you wish to care about this and

542
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:14,619
say browsers may wish to supply some

543
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,090
mode which you get into an unspecified

544
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:22,330
way that um odd that that behaves the

545
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,158
way Justin Justin between on on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

546
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,840
realized that will not please all the

547
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,309
people who wish we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not wish me to</font>

548
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,418
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> off web RTC of a default but those</font>

549
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,570
people are not going to get what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

550
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:33,729
want the one thing I would also mention

551
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,729
is color mention this to me privately is

552
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:41,080
that on most my understanding is that

553
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:43,869
most organizations care<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security and</font>

554
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,830
run VPNs also strongly disagreeing these

555
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:49,299
on these don't want VPNs and so we

556
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,099
really i think we I mean if we can find

557
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:53,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">some guidance that says don't do that</font>

558
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:55,658
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be useful to putting the</font>

559
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,859
document 2.2 to say like visit you know

560
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,059
the browser can help you out<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

561
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:03,879
basically this is your systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

562
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:06,460
figure in a way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't advise Ted Ted</font>

563
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:09,549
RT is an individual contributor I am

564
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:14,679
generally okay with the idea of making

565
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:17,408
this a descriptive text I am concerned

566
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">however and I don't care whether we deal</font>

567
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:24,460
with it here or in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web RTC context</font>

568
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:26,559
about making this something that the

569
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,989
user has to to find the invisible

570
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,049
control for on page<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of the about</font>

571
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:35,619
colon thing and so it would suggest that

572
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">as part of this text we say here example</font>

573
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:40,478
cases where it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the default so</font>

574
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,970
if for example we believe that private

575
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:46,210
browsing / incognito mode or the related

576
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,659
things is a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be</font>

577
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,919
the default that would be useful to do

578
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:54,729
but if the chair wishes to tell me that

579
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:57,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should take that to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> w w 3c I I</font>

580
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:59,690
might might agree i think i could

581
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:03,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably support that notion</font>

582
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,210
I would Justin Bieber I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

583
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a lot careful about that um you</font>

584
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,629
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think the notion of private</font>

585
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,009
browsing is that you leave no trace not

586
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:12,110
that you're not identified two websites

587
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:16,149
fact even says something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

588
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:18,258
you go into incognito mode and I just

589
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:20,299
you know we shouldn't overstate kind of

590
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:22,490
what incognito mode actually does you're

591
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,870
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> invisible um I think it's fine if</font>

592
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using liked or something else we</font>

593
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,739
were explicitly privacy-preserving but

594
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,480
like let's not overload the meaning of

595
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:34,909
like incognito so I mean we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

596
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,129
bandied about one point actually

597
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:40,100
suggesting a standardized affordance for

598
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:42,590
the VPN to tell you like you should kick

599
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,668
yourself into this mode I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

600
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,259
should I don't think about is easier

601
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,899
standardized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that such a thing</font>

602
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:48,889
but like if if someone came up with some

603
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:51,428
importance for that that made some sense

604
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:53,990
I think we do going to listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it um</font>

605
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,639
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know to do with that right I</font>

606
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,980
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what it'd be like the</font>

607
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:59,600
dhcp option or you you resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> am i</font>

608
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,059
eating can i think i'd be a blowout

609
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,918
example that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dalit or something I can</font>

anybody pn you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding mode tetra</font>

Justin raises I<font color="#E5E5E5"> however I think that</font>

00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this actually is sort of a broad</font>

614
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,959
question of when somebody is making use

615
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,990
of one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these and you have this sort</font>

616
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,480
of weird you're leaking things you would

617
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,309
not necessarily expect and clearly when

618
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,559
you're browsing even in incognito mode

619
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,779
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you are leaking the IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

620
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,000
from which you are browsing that there's

621
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:41,960
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of no way around that right leaking</font>

622
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,240
other addresses some of which may give a

623
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,269
great deal more information in in this

624
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,370
context I think means that if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

625
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:51,139
going to have a relatively clear

626
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,939
affordance to say here's how you turn

627
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:55,699
this on then we're going to have to

628
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,519
infer it in some way and if he's opposed

629
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,620
to inferring it on cool then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

630
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,230
should send a message over to our

631
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,570
brethren and WebRTC that we would like

632
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:09,019
an affordance to this so cone joins an

633
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,939
individual here um I so first of all I

634
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:12,700
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this only happens in tunnel VPNs</font>

635
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,800
which are highly wrought not recommend

636
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,260
by anyone for any reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

637
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,570
part right so I I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a corner</font>

638
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,300
case of we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> now to patch up a</font>

639
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,560
bug that somebody else introduced and

640
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,490
you know if that causes problems where

641
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,860
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it the next thing I'd like</font>

642
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,420
to mention is that if you expect privacy

643
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,790
you're going to have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

644
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,440
application inside of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

645
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,020
here that is focused around providing

646
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,360
you privacy and that application can

647
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,250
easily strip any address as it feels are

648
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,379
inappropriate it could remove all but

649
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,030
the turn addresses so the application

650
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,470
itself can do this it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

651
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,020
browser's going to guarantee it for you

652
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,940
at all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I don't think this is</font>

653
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">what private browsing mode was was meant</font>

654
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,660
for it all to respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in fact</font>

655
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,520
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know biggest use cases of</font>

656
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,200
WebRTC that's actively deployed today

657
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,230
involves us something that's mostly done

658
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:04,660
in private browsing mode it you know

659
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:07,090
these web interface things so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

660
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">dolt can't find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so I and it's</font>

661
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,419
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not linked to that type of</font>

662
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,290
privacy so i just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think do that</font>

663
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to mention was</font>

664
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,740
do with the default addresses the

665
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:19,330
default route often takes you out a

666
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,940
interface that makes you very sad in

667
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,370
many circumstances so I not be in favor

668
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,020
of seeing an algorithm where you had

669
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,449
multiple interfaces that we're all alive

670
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only use the one that had the</font>

671
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:36,970
default route because that's often not

672
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one you want Adam roach I'm going to</font>

673
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignore that because making my head hurt</font>

674
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,070
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to I wanted to view with</font>

675
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,930
the assertion that private browsing mode

676
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,780
doesn't mean this but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add on</font>

677
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:49,030
that I think the real salient point here

678
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,620
is up on the slide where we're pointing

679
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,990
out that real privacy protection

680
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,370
requires a lot more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just making</font>

681
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,730
sure people don't see your other IP

682
00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,219
address and giving users the illusion

683
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:02,460
that we're doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> magical by</font>

684
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,480
fixing this one tiny little aspect

685
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,180
protecting where they are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

686
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,350
is doing them a disservice you really

687
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,430
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if those people are</font>

688
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,990
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you steal them</font>

689
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,430
towards something like tor browser that

690
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,560
is going to sort of take care of all

691
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,900
that for them because having users try

692
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,850
to piecemeal this together is giving

693
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,320
them a gun without any instructions not

694
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,300
even telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> which end is dangerous and</font>

695
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,120
Sango all right we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show the</font>

696
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,340
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> word on this issue just generally I</font>

697
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that you know I agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

698
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,919
should have this not buried on page 7 of

699
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,750
the press I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be a</font>

off by default the optics this are

702
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,680
particularly bad you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes WebRTC</font>

703
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,450
kind of hurts the brand so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know making this have a standardized</font>

707

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a good idea because like the fact</font>

when you're in incognito mode versus

711
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,229
like in normal browsing that's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

behavioral differences or not what one

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:05,440
would expect yeah that's it John things

716
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,600
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the default route doesn't</font>

717
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,980
work because they don't see how you

718
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,439
reach the web page in the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that case through one of the other</font>

721
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,300
PCP works that's another issue but

722
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,560
anyway so but i think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i think</font>

723
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,810
you know also the you know the

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,060
application can do it answer isn't the

725
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,550
right answer because the threat model

726
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,980
here is the hostile<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript that</font>

you go to you know the China Chinese

743
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,260
government site and therefore they see

744
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,430
you're using a VPN to reach facebook

745
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:13,730

seeing in the internet wars on this

00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,380
page that has no indicia of being a

754
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,130

<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that then exposes that you</font>

lengths to make sure the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to do</font>

758
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:40,490
some pretty crazy stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get access to</font>

759
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,500
your to local IP and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

760
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and</font>

761
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,910
this may not be the place to do about to

762
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,670
do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the qualitative sort</font>

763
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,860
of guys we got two more she's so good

764
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:54,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">master Bernama i think we should move on</font>

765
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,459
it's the right way to explain exactly

766
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,930
what's going on or it's kind of

767
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,000
complicated depends on how the VPN sets

768
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,770
the default route blah blah let's talk

769
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it on the list let's have someone</font>

770
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,200
propose them to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and work from</font>

771
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:09,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay musingly randall Jessup just</font>

772
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,350
did that in the jabber browsers should

773
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,270
capital provide a way for users to

774
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,429
suppress interfaces from being visible

775
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,800
in WebRTC the details are left up to the

776
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:23,060
browser that be satisfactory to me the

777
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,820
satisfaction Justin so what's right and

778
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,810
so so I think what what let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> try John</font>

779
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,310
I think Justin<font color="#E5E5E5"> described pretty</font>

780
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,230
accurately what you would do if you

781
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">heard about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we should say</font>

782
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,510
describe that text say we don't

783
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend using kind of VPNs with that</font>

784
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:42,320
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser supply to go forward this</font>

785
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,490
is anything Justin's are set<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

786
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,740
someone someone can produce that text

787
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,470
expanding on what Randall<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shared</font>

788
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,879
and we will move on to oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

789
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,350
one's easy there's a bunch of essays

790
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:56,519
residue in the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just remove</font>

791
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,959
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire it it I think Magnus identified</font>

792
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,330
a couple couple of points where it was

793
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,799
just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that was obviously a</font>

794
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,149
holdover from the from the time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

795
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't certain about whether or not it</font>

796
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:12,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">was this his tears are a digital ssip</font>

797
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:14,999
right easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> next uh yeah something well</font>

798
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:19,830
we can blame<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaufman for this we still</font>

799
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:25,769
have to remove it next dad is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's</font>

800
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:28,678
it right that so Bernard<font color="#E5E5E5"> also submitted</font>

801
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:31,470
a bunch of issue tracker jacker so in

802
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,090
the wiki so that we're probably I went

803
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,230
back over the list there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple others</font>

804
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,570
I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to go through</font>

805
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:41,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of them but basically there was one</font>

806
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:42,658
issue on<font color="#CCCCCC"> srt p.m. ki and i think</font>

807
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:44,759
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed that nobody's</font>

808
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,190
implementing this in WebRTC do not use

809
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:52,649
but it's not in a draft so we should say

810
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:56,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was another one there</font>

811
00:33:52,649 --> 00:34:00,299
are other ones about this was our own oh

812
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:02,850
yeah Eric Eric summarized what happens

813
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,679
with respect to renegotiation and

814
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,918
existing implementations that wasn't

815
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:13,230
never made its way in do not use do not

816
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:16,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">use I think there was some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions oh</font>

817
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:20,399
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> about dtls allows you to</font>

818
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:22,558
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryu set up one Association</font>

819
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,440
and use it for both RTP and rtcp an

820
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,579
agreement was nobody does that either so

821
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,159
that probably should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in there don't</font>

822
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:34,559
do bad news don't do that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

823
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the in the non mux case trying</font>

824
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls connection to key both</font>

825
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:41,219
and the answers don't do that but it is

826
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,780
allowed in 5764 so there should be

827
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that says don't do that that's</font>

828
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:50,050
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crazy yeah</font>

829
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:52,029
yeah it's in 5764 anyway and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway</font>

830
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,340
we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the other remaining</font>

831
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,290
ones you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think any of those</font>

832
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,340
sound controversial if you think it

833
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,470
wasn't they were all just about

834
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,180
documenting what in fact everyone

835
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:04,930
already does but just shoving it in

836
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,819
there so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say ha don't do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

837
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,700
great thanks a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're</font>

841
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:36,000
think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

842
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished mainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because nobody nobody is</font>

saying yeah you should support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

854
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:29,910
that it has instead a reference to draft

855
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,500
ITF HTTP be a channel protocol that

856
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:35,520
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a shorter and</font>

857
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,430
care what exactly does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also</font>

858
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,759
downgrades the requirement to am a with

859
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,980
the based on the discussion at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">previous IDF that more or less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cited</font>

861
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,440
said well all the browsers are going to

862
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:53,810
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for commercial reasons and that we</font>

863
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:57,869
shouldn't force everyone to do it so may

864
00:36:53,810 --> 00:37:00,900
but I messed up the edit I<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost a couple</font>

865
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:04,290
of references to yes you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support</font>

866
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:07,770
proxy authentication and I'll put those

867
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:13,890
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in so that should be</font>

868
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:16,050
uncontroversial I think actually the one

869
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,859
that i thought was controversial but it

870
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:25,640
wasn't at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least when anime list was the</font>

871
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:27,970
bundling thing which is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

872
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:32,480
mandating something in

873
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:36,589
this document then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jessup has to say how</font>

874
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">your single doing that thing and Jessops</font>

875
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:43,160
that says that says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> babe balanced</font>

876
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:46,580
spam link mode is you propose one bundle

877
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:50,359
that can have everything in it but your

878
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:52,490
mark most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff mark the</font>

879
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,800
complicated stuff as if you don't

880
00:37:52,490 --> 00:38:01,450
understand bundle just so don't look at

881
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:04,220
this so transport 07 indicated that

882
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:06,620
there's a mandatory configuration that

883
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,810
says all the video is bundled in one

884
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,180
transport all the audio is bundle in

885
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:14,180
another transport and all the data is

886
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:17,330
bundled somewhere else since Jason

887
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:21,440
doesn't offer a way to get there we

888
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:32,360
shouldn't make it mandatory so I changed

889
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:33,950
it my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wesley I mean I I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

890
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that prod actually because I think it</font>

891
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:40,939
has some usage when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

892
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:44,750
apply a flow based us on it however and

893
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:47,000
I think it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this decision here</font>

894
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,070
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it's not about which spec</font>

895
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,950
you want to change we actually

896
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,750
specifying yes if I we do it or are we

897
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:57,020
removing it from transporter that's a

898
00:38:53,750 --> 00:39:01,340
thing is that it's more fair description

899
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,750
here but yeah so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand</font>

900
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,780
that as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have any</font>

901
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:09,770
multi-stream if you remove this we lose

902
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the capability of having multiple media</font>

903
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:17,960
streams<font color="#E5E5E5"> or media sources being bundled</font>

904
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:22,250
together on one flow no we don't we lose

905
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:25,280
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> bavaria type the by media type is</font>

906
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:29,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah or we lose the ability to mandate</font>

907
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,410
that all browsers be able to do this the

908
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:35,360
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> still says that it may do this and</font>

909
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the change was I raised</font>

910
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,340
this on the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got comments</font>

911
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:45,049
from acre and from Justin saying that

912
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,240
this is the way they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

913
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">be no other comments where a season list</font>

914
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,189
so I acted as acted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the assumption</font>

915
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this represents the consensus</font>

916
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,580
jonnicks I mean my impression was mostly

917
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,650
from talking to Peter rather than

918
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,779
actually reading it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the</font>

919
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:05,330
one dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> are one that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AP is will have</font>

920
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,420
AP is that can support multiple bundle

921
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:11,299
groups 10 well not so defer to one that

922
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,700
one I think it's useful feature but not

923
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,170
a you know a world breaking future if

924
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,700
it's not present so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one seems</font>

925
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,000
to get find<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to do it I will not</font>

926
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,290
promise anything about 1.1 I'm the

927
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,680
transport is controlled by Jessup<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

928
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">jay-z base and a transport should be</font>

929
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,870
constant consistent with Jessup<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Jace</font>

930
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,270
if should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent with the API I</font>

931
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:36,890
that's the layering as I interpret it

932
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:38,810
now no<font color="#E5E5E5"> promises for 1.1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Peter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thatcher</font>

933
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:43,310
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two separate things here</font>

934
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:45,230
one is what the policy does when it when

935
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:48,470
you call create offer what sdp it spits

936
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:52,250
out and the second thing is what sdp is

937
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:54,140
allowed in set<font color="#E5E5E5"> locals that remote so if</font>

938
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">we allow multiple bunder groups inset</font>

939
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:00,470
remote and you can still have bundled

940
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,090
over up audio bundled over one transport

941
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:06,500
nvidia bundled over another transport

942
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:07,940
regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy issue so the</font>

943
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,840
real question is what do we support

944
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,040
multiple vulnerable and it really

945
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,730
doesn't have to do anything have

946
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,759
anything to do with the policy because

947
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:23,230
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it even if the policy</font>

948
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,230
doesn't make it easy

949
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">s'ok on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jen's ah I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my understanding</font>

950
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:33,010
is if we sent it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is building</font>

951
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,480
just what you said basically there what

952
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,130
Peter said of you know if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

953
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,000
offer coming in that supports multiple

954
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:41,200
bundle groups you know bundle supporting

955
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,940
bundle requires you to be able to

956
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">support that and we would expect</font>

957
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,540
something reasonable to happen including

958
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,550
the possibility of negotiating all those

959
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,890
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so from a transport point of</font>

960
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,950
view we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly have more than one</font>

961
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:58,750
bundle and that this the decision I

962
00:41:53,950 --> 00:42:03,810
heard in the room now yesterday when we

963
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:05,800
discuss bundle was that it was allowed

964
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:10,330
specifically on a question from our

965
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:13,510
friends at Mozilla to reject all but one

966
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:19,660
bundle group and I'm happy with the

967
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:21,730
revisit that one but what yeah except

968
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,890
the hemlines but<font color="#CCCCCC"> except only one bundle</font>

969
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:27,460
group right so I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

970
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,750
ever a decision consensus on yesterday

971
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,280
that was where the discussion was going

972
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,320
which which seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a reasonable</font>

973
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,210
thing but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was certainly also be</font>

974
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,770
possible for them I thought we're

975
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,750
discussing today for them to when they

976
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,730
got this offer and from some nom no RTC

977
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:42,190
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had multiple ones they may</font>

978
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,110
reject all the bundles they may accept

979
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,180
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bundles they may accept more</font>

980
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,440
than one of the bundles right that's

981
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,730
what was the discussion I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

982
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,960
everybody was on at least agreement of

983
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,970
that there was disagreement of whether

984
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,010
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was api's that would cause you to</font>

985
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,629
create multiple bundles in a browsers

986
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm leaving that issue alone right now</font>

987
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,840
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I was anything to</font>

988
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,670
do with transport yeah but so I think

989
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,580
transport certainly has to allow for

990
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than one bundle yes it's a it's s</font>

991
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:12,190
may support<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the the text says</font>

992
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you must support a mode where</font>

993
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,880
everything is bundled together and you

994
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:20,260
must support the mode where where

995
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,530
nothing's bundled together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

996
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,800
and and that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> support other</font>

997
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,050
configurations that's the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

998
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,730
so it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any inconsistency</font>

999
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:35,650
with Jessica so that the text now has no

1000
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:40,100
inconsistency which is it

1001
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:42,650
it's the textin the text in version 7

1002
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:47,029
had an inconsistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a current text</font>

1003
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:50,510
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> jessup that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so yeah</font>

1004
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:52,580
my name is wisdom yeah I'm fine with

1005
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as it's possible and I</font>

1006
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">think but that possibility certain</font>

1007
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,790
degree needs to be reflected up the

1008
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,680
stack assembly sufficient degree I would

1009
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,970
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you actually have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shared some</font>

1010
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,649
chance of actually using this I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

1011
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:10,339
I can understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> if some implementation</font>

1012
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:13,160
at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't support it but so</font>

1013
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:16,340
as I as I understand it in Justin

1014
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,440
correct me if I'm wrong on the JC a

1015
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,410
bundle processing rules mostly apply to

1016
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,570
the offer so imagine so someone sent you

1017
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">some non je sep endpoint sent you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1018
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:28,850
fungal um offer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was but that was</font>

1019
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,370
done the way you suggest here namely

1020
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:34,069
audio one trench in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> below group and</font>

1021
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">video and open a group on you could</font>

1022
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,890
accept that regardless of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> among</font>

1023
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,870
the policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've been set for was</font>

1024
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,940
correct because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it only affects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bungo</font>

1025
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:45,500
only not the bundle group assignments

1026
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:48,020
and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're quite so so</font>

1027
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,960
so it certainly ought to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font>

1028
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,310
that browsers should be allowed to it

1029
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,230
encouraged to in fact except<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1030
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,000
except those except those bundle group

1031
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,280
offers now I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to argue about</font>

1032
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,650
what level for anyone that enormous

1033
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,510
right there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be but like like I</font>

1034
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,800
consider it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of deficiency that we</font>

1035
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,210
only have the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we probably</font>

1036
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,640
should get around to accepting more of

1037
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,890
them automation a huge deficiency right

1038
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,819
not a non compliance but its efficiency

1039
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:16,100
on the relevant question for me is on

1040
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,930
should the do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> API surface for</font>

1041
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer to control bundler group</font>

1042
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,620
assignment and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

1043
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ground their day and as I understood</font>

1044
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:29,120
Cohen's argument was that the process

1045
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:31,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because bundle groups are tied to</font>

1046
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,759
transport parameters and because

1047
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,290
so-and-so our cost per settings if you

1048
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,700
have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> or qua settings and you</font>

1049
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,140
must have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a necessity a different metric</font>

1050
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:44,470
but

1051
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:45,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct I mean I i don't know i</font>

1052
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,990
want going to hear but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font>

1053
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the day and i shouldn't have used</font>

1054
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs i should have used priority</font>

1055
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:52,630
settings the<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority stuff that we're</font>

1056
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:55,420
doing that that API would if you had

1057
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,809
some video at one priority level in some

1058
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,220
video at a different priority level we

1059
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:01,539
have agreement in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group to</font>

1060
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,859
add that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a pull request</font>

1061
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:04,420
because we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for the</font>

1062
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:05,740
doohickeys to get in first before we

1063
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,299
could send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pull request it was one</font>

1064
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,089
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the driving cases for adding the</font>

1065
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:12,339
doohickeys but you know yes we're going

1066
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:16,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a pull request on that right no</font>

1067
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:18,308
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that maybe we do I hate</font>

1068
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:21,130
this separately but I'm just trying and

1069
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:24,279
trying to put my head around<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this</font>

1070
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:27,730
interaction because presumably what

1071
00:46:24,279 --> 00:46:30,400
would happen I mean if that say we had a

1072
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:33,369
pull request for that would I be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1073
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,299
frog the priority settings after the

1074
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:35,950
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> was set up and without</font>

1075
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:38,470
requiring negotiation<font color="#CCCCCC"> too deep bungle</font>

1076
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,910
things what would our set right say we

1077
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,618
have everything bungled in one group and

1078
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,180
then I say well actually audience really

1079
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:44,410
high and visually<font color="#E5E5E5"> your low does that</font>

1080
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,240
mean I have to deep humble and do a

1081
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:49,089
Rehan CD bundle or that be<font color="#E5E5E5"> forbidden</font>

1082
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,348
black what's your thought it was

1083
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:51,670
assuming that stuff was set when you

1084
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,230
added two tracks or whatever but I mean

1085
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,210
it doesn't I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what happened to</font>

1086
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:59,319
changed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you</font>

1087
00:46:55,210 --> 00:47:01,930
have to reoffer yeah just inferred yeah

1088
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just really I could point that sort</font>

1089
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,399
of makes some sense but it's a sort of

1090
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,868
implicit API they were saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> like d</font>

1091
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,180
bungalow or bangla these things based on

1092
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:14,109
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just about bundling</font>

1093
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:16,180
and like my main concern here is that or

1094
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:18,190
any API surface that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as simple as</font>

1095
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,868
a policy you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1096
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:22,299
well you know you can bungle audio and

1097
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:24,309
video separately and like that make some

1098
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:26,740
sense but you know kung collins<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1099
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:28,269
talked about you know this sort of

1100
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,890
notion of i want to send thumbnails in

1101
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:31,779
one bundle and main video another bundle

1102
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,250
and so like I think the API surface

1103
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:37,539
going to be much more detail here than

1104
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:39,160
any simple policy setting so I think we

1105
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:40,509
could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for the one point out of</font>

1106
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,009
things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can still have a lot of things</font>

1107
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">still to figure out in this my general</font>

1108
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:45,339
feeling is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just tolerate</font>

1109
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,119
whatever we receive but what we generate

1110
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:48,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be very simple</font>

1111
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,420
so work we cut the line sorry i meant to

1112
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,560
say we cut the line and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't want to</font>

1113
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,770
interrupt him but we're cutting the line

1114
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:00,340
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> peter for two of you who joined after</font>

1115
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:02,020
Peter lo siento amigos<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Adam Roche</font>

1116
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,380
i'm mostly getting up to every other

1117
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">justin i believe where i think that</font>

1118
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,110
right now we shouldn't worry too much

1119
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,720
about what the w3c will do for

1120
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,280
subsequent versions of this and we

1121
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,950
should leave the door open for accepting

1122
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:23,260
those things good but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> say anything</font>

1123
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:25,930
more than that Peter Thatcher I was just

1124
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the w3c world</font>

1125
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:31,210
this could all be solved not with a

1126
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:33,640
policy but rather with RTP sender<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot</font>

1127
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,010
set transport because then the

1128
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript could do whatever it wants</font>

1129
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,620
arranging<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different things and if</font>

1130
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,080
you were crazy you could even make that

1131
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,630
fire on negotiate needed in a bundle

1132
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,220
groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> appear but it would be</font>

1133
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,230
effectively one method<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font>

1134
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:51,330
very flexible rather than a complicated

1135
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:51,330
policy that's one possibility

1136
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:58,090
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the conclusion from</font>

1137
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:02,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions as far as we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1138
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:05,980
conclusion is that this that the text in

1139
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,620
dash 08 seems to say roughly what we

1140
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:15,520
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say but that there's a huge</font>

1141
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:18,640
amount of of uncertainty and people need

1142
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:23,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jsf and transport</font>

1143
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,799
and bundle all at the same time and

1144
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:30,399
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes on lists by the way this</font>

1145
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,880
draft is now on github get up is a very

1146
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,230
fine place for suggesting text I mean

1147
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:43,000
many people have figured out how to

1148
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:46,300
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and get up okay so next</font>

1149
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,680
slide that oh this is like that that

1150
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:57,130
we're now on changes i have not made but

1151
00:49:50,680 --> 00:50:01,029
i want to or I want the group's advice

1152
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:06,700
on how to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this there are two</font>

1153
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:12,240
changes one of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is whether we</font>

1154
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:16,689
should rip a reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Schwartz</font>

1155
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:19,810
return document which is corporate turn

1156
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:23,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">boxes so so we actually have that later</font>

1157
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:25,870
in the meeting the consideration of that

1158
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,730
that draft I'm happy too happy to leave

1159
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,950
it to take the conclusions from that

1160
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,420
discussion okay and since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1161
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:33,910
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that drought we</font>

1162
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,670
have those feet up a little bit so for

1163
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:41,049
the next one please rails<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next</font>

1164
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:44,800
slide okay srip DTRS over ice five

1165
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:48,550
doubles this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just after reading</font>

1166
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:51,280
through the dtls document and the dtls

1167
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:54,030
srtp document and seeing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> text they</font>

1168
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,360
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with a following and</font>

1169
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:04,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">notes to add to the text basically</font>

1170
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:07,199
saying btls srtp as defined in RFC 55-7

1171
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:08,910
64 defines protection of data carried

1172
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:12,539
over a single UDP source and destination

1173
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:15,269
port<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the context of using eyes</font>

1174
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,519
the term singing UDP source and

1175
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:19,738
destination port pair needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1176
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:25,258
understood as a single eyes component as

1177
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:27,809
defined in RFC 552<font color="#E5E5E5"> 425 just anybody so</font>

1178
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:29,130
um 5763 is actually very clear and

1179
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:30,900
explicit about how the stuff is supposed

1180
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:34,049
to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

1181
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,150
thing 5764 has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of ambiguous</font>

1182
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:39,209
text but really 5764<font color="#E5E5E5"> words and talk</font>

1183
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:41,579
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice at all that's the work that's</font>

1184
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:44,009
a bad thing about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes yeah I mean but</font>

1185
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:46,559
I yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the main thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1186
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:47,969
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what 5763</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i forgot the</font>

1187
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,729
section number is but it says exactly

1188
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:52,949
how this should be handled you know

1189
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:55,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of talking about 5764 even at</font>

1190
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:56,339
all I'm actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some slides for EM</font>

1191
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:58,319
music tomorrow that's going to talk

1192
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:02,849
about this specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can you</font>

1193
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:04,769
send text yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely yeah what</font>

1194
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:06,539
Justin said in addition right<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

1195
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:08,698
single eyes component is only one side

1196
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it and if you have working this</font>

1197
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:15,380
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work spoki well that if you have</font>

1198
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,369
forking then you have multiple ice

1199
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,799
transports right we're all with the same

1200
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:23,219
component because the component only

1201
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:26,219
refers to the offer right now components

1202
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:29,039
are probably one side and at the

1203
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:30,839
transport level components they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

1204
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:35,489
are scooped by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I by the ice</font>

1205
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:37,349
connection but I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5245 if you look</font>

1206
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:40,650
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition of component it's like</font>

1207
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:42,689
one it's just refers to one a candidate

1208
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:46,400
now if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

1209
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:49,399
they they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different components</font>

1210
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

1211
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:59,919
that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that's all we have I</font>

1212
00:52:55,110 --> 00:53:02,680
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecker if you tell me where to send</font>

1213
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,630
texts I can send texts and until we have

1214
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:08,319
a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the reference I would like</font>

1215
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:10,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep this text here okay so Keith dry</font>

1216
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,850
here I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to express a concern</font>

1217
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're inviting the entire IETF</font>

1218
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:17,319
discussion apparently to go to get up

1219
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,960
when the official means of communication

1220
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,600
is the IETF released or the list for

1221
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this working group so at least issues of</font>

1222
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:28,210
a discussion nature should make their

1223
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:35,759
way in some form to the RTC web working

1224
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:35,760
group list not just hide on get up yes

1225
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:45,730
yes and text suggestions are good on

1226
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">github and it also is it it's a tool i</font>

1227
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:49,660
use to keep track of what I remember

1228
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:52,180
from the many lists so that yes it is

1229
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,859
not a mailing list yes and you can

1230
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,118
suggest on the mailing list as well but

1231
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion will remain on the</font>

1232
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,660
mailing list no matter where the text

1233
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:06,790
suggestions army right Ben you're up

1234
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:09,190
thank you hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Ben Schwartz and we are</font>

1235
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:10,630
short on time let's go yeah these slides

1236
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:13,810
are going to look really familiar to a

1237
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:15,790
lot of people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> return five is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1238
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:17,230
as return for but it's got new figures

1239
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,090
it's a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier to understand</font>

1240
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,950
it's a little bit clearer and it has

1241
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:23,170
this nice extra discussion about

1242
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:24,669
handling these multi-tenant cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

1243
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,650
servers which is an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case</font>

1244
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,119
and thanks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much Don Johnston and</font>

1245
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,460
John<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yoakam food did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very detailed</font>

1246
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:33,790
thorough review to help with this next

1247
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so this is the same as always the</font>

1248
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,480
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> serve is normally configured by the</font>

1249
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,940
web page but with this argument RTC peer

1250
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,710
connection and then you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your relay</font>

1251
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,030
candidates and there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

1252
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:49,480
reasons why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use a turn</font>

1253
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:52,420
server if you're an application but oh

1254
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it looks like this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just this</font>

1255
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,420
should look familiar you get a host

1256
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,830
candidate maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a server</font>

1257
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,109
reflexive candidate if you're going to

1258
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:02,890
relay candidate from the turn server you

1259
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:04,029
speak different protocols to them so

1260
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:08,049
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have this requirement in</font>

1261
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:09,880
what is now actually an RFC that the

1262
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:12,130
enterprise turn servers have to be

1263
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,260
somehow integrated into WebRTC but we've

1264
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:16,569
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually clarified how their</font>

1265
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,799
integrated return is designed to pin

1266
00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:19,180
down exactly what it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1267
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:21,029
supposed to do if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

1268
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,538
yourself with an enterprise turns over

1269
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:28,869
so we have this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a these figures are</font>

1270
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:31,660
basically Alan Alan's figures adapted

1271
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:35,019
from from ascii art format into slide

1272
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:38,799
format so suppose that you had a turn

1273
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:40,689
server that was somehow in the basically

1274
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,519
in the DMZ<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a border turn</font>

1275
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:45,099
server it's it's somehow associated with

1276
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:46,720
your network border stuff then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

1277
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:50,589
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a candidate on it potentially if you</font>

1278
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,410
knew about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marked as I've</font>

1279
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:54,788
mark it here as a border candidate we've

1280
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:58,868
somehow gotten it from this turns over

1281
00:55:54,789 --> 00:56:00,430
but next slide we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what to do</font>

1282
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:02,589
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might really want to use</font>

1283
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">it because in some cases the firewall</font>

1284
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:05,980
will actually block all of the traffic

1285
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:09,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to use to the</font>

1286
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:11,829
application turns over for example or to

1287
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:14,049
use the server reflexive so on those

1288
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:16,900
networks where the where the network

1289
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:19,089
operator has blocked UDP in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1290
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,930
has it has allowed it to authorized

1291
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:24,670
users via the enterprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

1292
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:27,308
maybe for quality of service reasons who

1293
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,079
knows we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to use</font>

1294
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:32,160
that candidate so but to do that we need

1295
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:34,390
we need some idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1296
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,960
currently we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even assign it a type</font>

1297
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,819
because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any standards to</font>

1298
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,599
define how to handle such a thing so

1299
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:45,910
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> returned so return explains that</font>

1300
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,579
what you're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do if you get a</font>

1301
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:52,180
candidate off of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise turn</font>

1302
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:53,680
server is that that candidate actually

1303
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,700
should act like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a virtual network</font>

1304
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,828
interface so to be clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

1305
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,419
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking that turn server and dumping</font>

1306
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:03,519
it into the list of turn servers along

1307
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,730
with the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn server instead</font>

1308
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:11,709
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit like a VPN it's a lot</font>

1309
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:13,869
like a proxy so next slide so if you if

1310
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,380
you think of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a proxy then what</font>

1311
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:18,559
you actually want to do is

1312
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:21,440
you want to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> that port and treat it</font>

1313
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,269
as a host port on a new virtual

1314
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,309
interface represented by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

1315
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:26,450
server you might even want to do stun

1316
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:28,309
over that interface although in most

1317
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:30,740
cases that's actually redundant you

1318
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:32,029
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but maybe</font>

1319
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:35,538
you do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just it's irrelevant</font>

1320
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:38,359
doesn't hurt and you most importantly

1321
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:40,309
want to connect through to the

1322
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:41,869
application provided turn server in case

1323
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:43,819
the application really needs you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1324
00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:45,650
running through that turn server for

1325
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:47,150
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's trying to hide your</font>

1326
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,940
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the other person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1327
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:53,630
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or again for quality</font>

1328
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of service or routing control reasons in</font>

1329
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,990
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this you need a double turn</font>

1330
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,459
connection you're actually tunneling a

1331
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:00,109
turn connection to the application turn

1332
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,490
server through the enterprise turns over

1333
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,680
and as there's no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that that</font>

1334
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't require any change to turn it</font>

1335
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,149
just is a strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the client needs</font>

1336
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,869
to use if it finds itself in this case

1337
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:13,700
next so we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a proxy it's very</font>

1338
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:15,559
analogous to the classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of web</font>

1339
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,750
proxies that we're used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

1340
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the like awful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inline</font>

1341
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,349
proxies that are messing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your</font>

1342
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:23,240
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about the auto</font>

1343
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:24,980
discovered proxies like the things you

1344
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,720
find in the web proxy auto discovery

1345
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,339
protocol which has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> around since</font>

1346
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">nineteen ninety nine or the things that</font>

1347
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:35,509
the user configures the door operating

1348
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:38,119
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something okay next so right</font>

1349
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:40,190
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what an HTTP HTTP proxy</font>

1350
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:41,869
looks like it lives in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMZ you</font>

1351
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,880
somehow find out about it through some

1352
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:46,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto discovery protocol your traffic is</font>

1353
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,019
actually addressed to that proxy and you

1354
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:49,490
speak some protocol to it to make it

1355
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:50,990
make connections on your behalf and

1356
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:53,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's exactly what we're talking about</font>

1357
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:58,430
here for turn the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference is TCP</font>

1358
00:58:53,180 --> 00:59:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus UDP basically so there's one</font>

1359
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:04,819
interesting case that that Alan and John

1360
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:07,730
found what we were talking about this

1361
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:11,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if hypothetically your application</font>

1362
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:13,339
were had a contract with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turned</font>

1363
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,839
server provider that was providing their

1364
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:16,940
turns over and wanted all traffic to go

1365
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:19,460
through it demanded that all traffic go

1366
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,079
through it and your enterprise network

1367
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,750
that you were on also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a contract</font>

1368
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,519
with the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise same cloud</font>

1369
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,350
turns of her provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also demanded</font>

1370
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,549
that all traffic go through that

1371
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:34,290
do you have to go through once or do you

1372
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:35,640
have to go through twice that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1373
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:39,390
guess you could do other interesting

1374
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:41,549
things so so we thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

1375
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:44,700
decided you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide you</font>

1376
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:45,870
actually do have to go through twice and

1377
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:49,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that you have to go through</font>

1378
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:52,680
twice is that the potentially the

1379
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,060
authorization is independent for these

1380
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,250
two things and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine for</font>

1381
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:59,970
example a cloud provider giving

1382
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:02,750
statistics back to the back to the

1383
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:05,129
people who are paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the traffic so</font>

1384
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:07,410
those statistics could easily include

1385
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:10,250
the IP addresses that are being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1386
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:13,290
connect and so essentially to preserve

1387
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:17,580
preserve user privacy and get correct

1388
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:19,200
billing you you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect twice as</font>

1389
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,460
if the certain turns over is independent

1390
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,770
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can come up with a way to</font>

1391
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:24,300
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> this safely in the future in cases</font>

1392
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the authorization or the origin</font>

1393
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,920
attributes work right then we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1394
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thompson i think is I think</font>

1395
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,390
this is an okay conclusion if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> term</font>

1396
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">server wants to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> special so</font>

1397
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:37,950
that it doesn't have to send packets to

1398
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:39,210
itself just realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these two</font>

1399
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:43,290
things are the same internally and

1400
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:44,910
optimize it out that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so I</font>

1401
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,590
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody who deploys cloud</font>

1402
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:54,990
turn server should be really excited

1403
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:58,530
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conclusion I don't know what</font>

1404
01:00:54,990 --> 01:01:00,509
you're referring to anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in</font>

1405
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:03,540
conclusion return hasn't changed still

1406
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:04,860
gives us precise precise description of

1407
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,150
how we're supposed to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1408
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,610
requirements that are already documented

1409
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:10,850
but now we have nicer figures and

1410
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:13,320
hopefully it's all a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit clearer</font>

1411
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:15,420
since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> college's I asked analyst but</font>

1412
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,340
one questions was about how we discover

1413
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,290
these and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this has huge</font>

1414
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,580
security implications on what the answer

1415
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:24,450
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we definitely need to</font>

1416
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:26,520
answer that fairly concretely sure I'm

1417
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to talk about that so what's the</font>

1418
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:35,970
answer the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the answer is I</font>

1419
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:38,399
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually out of scope I think</font>

1420
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:39,598
it's irrelevant and so scram

1421
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,729
auto-discovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1422
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,319
so I i do not think it's possible to

1423
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:44,819
analyze the security property disease

1424
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:46,229
and more specifically whether this is

1425
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:48,150
going to be used to man in middle my

1426
01:01:46,229 --> 01:01:50,069
traffic which is a major concern in the

1427
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:54,180
security and analysis of security

1428
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:56,430
documents of ITF and so I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not want us</font>

1429
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,229
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that issue needs to be</font>

1430
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:00,328
answered in a concrete way in the

1431
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:01,470
documents before I can decide whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1432
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:03,809
think that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> reference this</font>

1433
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:07,019
document or not this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document cannot and</font>

1434
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:09,390
will not include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the auto discovery or</font>

1435
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:12,299
discovery mechanisms because the tram

1436
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:13,828
working group owns that it's fine for it

1437
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:15,599
to reference the tram working group i'm

1438
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:18,119
not saying it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done you know</font>

1439
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're sorry you just said that you</font>

1440
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,200
won't reference those nuts know it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1441
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,288
mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can it wouldn't be in this</font>

1442
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,819
document yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1443
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:27,960
the methods are proposing over there

1444
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:30,599
right now would be a big security

1445
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,710
problem for us it'd be much worse than

1446
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:33,720
the stuff that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about with</font>

1447
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:36,089
split VPNs a minute ago right so they

1448
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,038
allow anyone to take it out of you know

1449
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:40,259
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attack and move it over yeah</font>

1450
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:42,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is exactly parallel to a</font>

1451
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,729
long-standing and universally deployed

1452
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,529
system no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the same as</font>

1453
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:50,009
the back files yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

1454
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:53,729
the same as pack files long-standing

1455
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:55,140
bang equal well below so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1456
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:57,118
could talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

1457
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know how auto-discovery works and</font>

1458
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,869
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security documents but as ben</font>

1459
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:02,430
says this is really orthogonal to that

1460
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:04,349
this is saying if we finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1461
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,969
things here's what we do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I think</font>

1462
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:07,499
we should treat that separately and sigh

1463
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:08,999
as working<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from if you'll be</font>

1464
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:12,808
following these things is this the right

1465
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:15,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm pretty</font>

1466
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:17,249
casual<font color="#E5E5E5"> against putting in something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1467
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:20,660
may allow random people at the starbucks

1468
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:23,218
demand in the middle all my traffic now

1469
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,140
the proxy pac file is somewhat different

1470
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:26,789
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was going to be the</font>

1471
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,650
method we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this and we also</font>

1472
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:30,239
described<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine its second question which</font>

1473
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:32,009
is how do we get the credentials to use

01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,779
these servers which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a complete</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blow off answer oh you just use the</font>

1476
01:03:33,779 --> 01:03:37,559
enterprise potentials anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does</font>

1477
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really work in practice we're going</font>

1478
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,979
to need a lot more specific than that I

1479
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:45,119
guess we can keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we are over</font>

1480
01:03:40,979 --> 01:03:47,609
time Alan Johnson so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really just</font>

1481
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how we can get to turn servers in</font>

1482
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:52,640
a given into a single candidate

1483
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Billy and make it work and we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1484
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,069
to happen otherwise when we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind</font>

1485
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:00,049
an enterprise system WebRTC is not going

1486
01:03:58,069 --> 01:04:01,549
to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

1487
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:03,259
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and if there are</font>

1488
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:05,479
security issues we need to work through

1489
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:07,099
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those but also point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1490
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:08,689
this is for cases where people control

1491
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:10,130
the network so if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1492
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to route packets through a</font>

1493
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,369
turn server you know in an enterprise

1494
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:15,109
they can do anything they want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1495
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:20,569
packets so there's really no difference

1496
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:22,848
there at all Ted already first they

1497
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:25,579
can't do anything they want to my

1498
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:27,859
packets they can drop them at any at any

1499
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:29,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment that but not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at anything can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1500
01:04:27,859 --> 01:04:35,538
go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide that shows the double</font>

1501
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:37,549
turn no keep going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> died right there</font>

1502
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:39,739
we go so as I understand it the border

1503
01:04:37,549 --> 01:04:44,479
turned proxy there's that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a now</font>

1504
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:47,259
invisible dot that represents the border

1505
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:49,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn proxy which is now forwarding the</font>

1506
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:51,650
the traffic through to the turn server

1507
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:53,900
in the cloud is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1508
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:55,940
it's like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> miniscule risking missing</font>

1509
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:59,420
there and the theory is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in this</font>

1510
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:04,509
case the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relay to candidate is turn in</font>

1511
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:07,910
turn right and so how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that the</font>

1512
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:10,269
browser and application context know

1513
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:14,930
that they are to generate turn in turn

1514
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:18,379
the application depending on your

1515
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:21,950
definition in in the JavaScript sense is

1516
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:24,579
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> your toy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correct I apologize that</font>

1517
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:27,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">was I meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser or mobile</font>

1518
01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:32,450
application using a browser substrate

1519
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:34,759
sure so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is that it it's up to</font>

1520
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:37,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">the browser to determine what is a</font>

1521
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:40,279
trustworthy mechanism of accepting a

1522
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:44,569
turn configuration for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

1523
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:48,170
imagine an a registry setting that

1524
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:50,089
allows an enterprise to just exactly the

1525
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">same as proxy configuration to set an</font>

1526
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:58,009
operating system setting that that adds

1527
01:05:53,390 --> 01:06:00,109
a turn proxy alongside its HTTP proxy so

1528
01:05:58,009 --> 01:06:02,390
that UDP traffic can exit the network in

1529
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:03,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that allows TCP traffic to</font>

1530
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:08,500
exit the network through that age

1531
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:10,750
Judy proxy so in mobile devices then am

1532
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:13,480
I to understand that in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile device</font>

1533
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this OS setting would be present at all</font>

1534
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:20,800
times the Android<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aware of android</font>

1535
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:23,560
android has a user-controlled operating

1536
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:27,490
system setting for setting an HTTP or

1537
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:29,759
socks proxy I got a GUI and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1538
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:38,589
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user to set that</font>

1539
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:40,060
ok so I imagine most cases you wouldn't

1540
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:41,560
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the same proxy at all times</font>

1541
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're getting at you</font>

1542
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,620
know and I think that it's probably

1543
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:49,990
discovered from the network via pack or

1544
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:52,540
you know some similar type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of X so given</font>

1545
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:58,990
given that let's assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

1546
01:06:52,540 --> 01:07:00,430
case here where the so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there</font>

1547
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:03,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a number of fragilities and</font>

01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:07,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential optimization so as I</font>

1550
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,950
understand it you you you believe that

1551
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:11,440
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be enough cases here</font>

1552
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,210
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT firewall will simply block</font>

1553
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,700
the UDP outbound traffic unless it's

1554
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:17,650
going to a turn server that RTC will

1555
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,629
have no effective candidates because it

1556
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:22,000
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to able to reach the</font>

01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:24,880
turn server in the cloud much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1558
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,470
able to send direct connect so I

1559
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,430
understand that that's the that's the

1560
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:32,890
the motivating example here I think the

1561
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm having it and I think</font>

1562
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe a generalization of the problem</font>

1563
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:39,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cullen raised is you you can't</font>

1564
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve that case by introducing fragility</font>

1565
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:43,629
into other cases and so I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

1566
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:47,620
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the case where somebody</font>

1567
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:49,510
who has such a setting starts to send to

1568
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:51,130
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turn to the turn server in the</font>

1569
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:55,090
cloud which then goes I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1570
01:07:51,130 --> 01:08:00,220
where send they turn inside this I don't

1571
01:07:55,090 --> 01:08:03,490
follow it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah it's it it's</font>

1572
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:05,350
old words Justin<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's yet it's never</font>

1573
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,910
ambiguous it's never ambiguous the

1574
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:09,670
application provides a set of turn

1575
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:11,500
servers those are the terminal turn

1576
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,080
servers as far as the application is

1577
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:16,100
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's where the that's</font>

1578
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:19,790
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application data is exiting</font>

1579
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,680
but so I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the web the web</font>

1580
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:23,420
proxy but there are two different kinds

1581
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of web proxy and there's a web proxy</font>

1582
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:27,710
where you actually expect the proxy

1583
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:29,750
itself to behave according to a set of

1584
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:31,910
rules and there's an app and there is a

1585
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:33,979
web proxy where what you expect is that

1586
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:35,479
it it's told to connect and it's a

1587
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:38,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">pass-through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for certain kinds of</font>

1588
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:41,389
traffic and what I'm hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say is</font>

1589
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:45,560
actually that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you expect turn in turn</font>

1590
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:47,540
here which implies to me that the one

1591
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,820
element of this term will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpreted</font>

1592
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,460
by that proxy before being passed on

1593
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:55,490
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens in a</font>

1594
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:57,230
connect and in a connected simply you

1595
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,849
issue something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning and it</font>

1596
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:00,769
passes through from that point on

1597
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:03,710
without d capsulation without anything

1598
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:05,690
the exact protocol used for HTTP connect

1599
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,220
is indeed substantially different and if

1600
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:12,549
you're looking for a protocol analogy

1601
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:15,109
it's much closer to socks I think that

1602
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:17,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need some more discussion on the list</font>

1603
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,410
speaking as an individual and not as

1604
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,670
chair I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some more</font>

1605
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:22,608
discussion on though it seems like a

1606
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:25,580
great beer topic as well upstairs could

1607
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:26,660
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a consensus car I feel</font>

1608
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,300
like we've talked about this now<font color="#CCCCCC"> for two</font>

1609
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:31,279
IDs and you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been much</font>

1610
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,359
miss discussion at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all so I feel like</font>

1611
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,219
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been following this</font>

1612
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:35,320
pretty closely and I feel like no would

1613
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:38,590
be ready to make a decision here

1614
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:43,420
decision to adopt it as a worker but yes

1615
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right I'm willing to do that now um</font>

1616
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,420
yeah

1617
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,390
yeah fair enough like I uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

1618
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:52,380
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since we're a</font>

1619
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:54,270
little over time we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1620
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,450
confirm this on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1621
01:09:54,270 --> 01:10:00,950
those in<font color="#CCCCCC"> favor of adopting the draft</font>

1622
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:00,950
please home now

1623
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:12,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so all those that oppose a doctor</font>

1624
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:14,310
mr. out please thumbnail it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

1625
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:16,348
rough but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think good enough to pull in</font>

1626
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:20,730
so we obviously have to confirm that

1627
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alyssa to do so I formally object to</font>

1628
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:23,968
adopting that draft without enough time

1629
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:25,650
to actually discuss or get answers to

1630
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:30,090
all any of the security questions that's

1631
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:33,540
right we have a very own yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1632
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:35,630
that I'll take take the roughness of the

1633
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:38,730
harmonic<font color="#E5E5E5"> continued discussion as a</font>

1634
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:42,260
direction not to insert any<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything in</font>

1635
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:42,259
the transport draft at this time

1636
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:10,330
you
