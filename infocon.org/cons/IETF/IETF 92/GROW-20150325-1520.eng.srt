50
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,239
expired stuff grow bgp shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that</font>

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,560
this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be waiting on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to the authors and unless there's one of</font>

54
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">them around the grow RP sale via also</font>

55
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:59,170
expired and so did the leak attack no

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,850
help b.tech note bgp sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> no help that</font>

57
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,530
expired in favor of shrooms draft i

58
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,269
believe so unless somebody wants to

59
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">argue about that we'll leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one go</font>

60
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,970
next there's a two that are in

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,220
processing the route policy

62
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,320
considerations is in iesg processing

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,180
don't remember what the extech exact

64
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,620
status for that is and then the route

65
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,330
server operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the editor q</font>

66
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,030
so it should pop out as an RFC at some

67
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,570
point in time and then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font>

68
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,570
of presentations

69
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:40,369
alright so there's a the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> stories</font>

70
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">last time there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pink box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay stay</font>

71
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:48,680
in the pink box talk to Mike do you want

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,970
to present yeah okay it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

73
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,720
harder for you to be in the box and also

74
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:59,110
present but oh I can move then I'll stay

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,109
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box</font>

76
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,840
push a button on the things it doesn't

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,840
work

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:51,030
ok and should i use this yeah so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

79
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,480
is Jackie O Hara from aunt Edie and I

80
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,570
this is an introduction of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP dump</font>

81
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,610
to which I developed this is the tool to

82
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:08,280
read the real dump so the motivation is

83
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:11,820
that the we are saving<font color="#E5E5E5"> route routing</font>

84
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,260
table in route<font color="#CCCCCC"> of use project and right</font>

85
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">NECC mainly and there is saved as a file</font>

86
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:27,950
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new tool to read those</font>

87
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:31,860
routing tables it is a beneficial if we

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:36,360
analyze those full routing table to the

89
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">health health check and or the molded in</font>

90
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:46,950
the future round table shape so<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an</font>

91
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:50,490
ISP I belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that is all I wanted to</font>

92
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:56,370
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we are doing by comparing</font>

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:06:00,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP route and also I in doing so I</font>

94
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,560
wanted to modify something so that so I

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:08,490
developed it from the scratch so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kind of you know but the rube dump</font>

97
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:20,160
files how we save them like the this is

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:23,849
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kota and target AS is called a rod</font>

99
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,380
monitor or the target is a busy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacifica</font>

100
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:33,590
is called Rob monitor and we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font>

101
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,590
appear in the ripp file

102
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:46,240
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a DS list of existing tools</font>

103
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:49,810
but I created a new one yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it meets</font>

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:54,939
a goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I succeeded the support the GDP</font>

105
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:59,349
so that we can read the right sorry

106
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:06,639
right real file as well in using this

107
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:10,120
tool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's good in this is just this</font>

108
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:16,590
is the simple example of the simple

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:21,909
display and we can we have a partial

110
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:25,270
compatible mode with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the zip it up the</font>

111
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:32,669
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and local prefer those are not</font>

112
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:37,719
yet shown but briefly it is compatible

113
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:42,279
right now and we can show the display we

114
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:47,729
can show the pier table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Poppaea</font>

115
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:53,440
routing table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> palkia statistics like</font>

116
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:59,020
how much how<font color="#CCCCCC"> not what number of routes</font>

117
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:04,210
is contained in each pier and what is

118
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:09,750
the distribution of the prefix length

119
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:14,289
like the of course the / 24 is the most

120
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:18,580
biggest one that has the distribution

121
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:21,490
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to know how much next</font>

122
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop it includes and mostly they are one</font>

123
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:30,099
but sometimes depending on the

124
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:37,328
configuration some files includes up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

125
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:45,220
200 next<font color="#E5E5E5"> stops in India rip file so this</font>

126
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:47,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the speed like if we just visit cut</font>

127
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,279
this is the lower bound

128
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:56,809
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> take 30 seconds if we are</font>

129
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">using leopard am pasa it's gonna for</font>

130
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">four hundred thirty seconds if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

131
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:09,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">using lip BZP done it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 150</font>

132
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:15,620
seconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours 90 seconds so a little</font>

133
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:21,529
bit advantage in the speed so i created

134
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:27,350
the diff option which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of like a</font>

135
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:32,529
unified if like if we specify two<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers</font>

136
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,540
and if the route is the prefix is only

137
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:39,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">found in the left beer then it's going</font>

138
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,599
to be minus sign and if perfect's is

139
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:51,559
only the right side then it's going to

140
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:54,620
be plus and but when we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

141
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:58,730
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the next question come up we'll</font>

142
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:03,620
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yeah we don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these prefix</font>

143
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:09,459
in the left pier but should<font color="#E5E5E5"> short I mean</font>

144
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:16,100
should shoulder length prefix covers

145
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:20,719
this range so that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked up in the</font>

146
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:23,660
left side left hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> pier there is no</font>

147
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,019
region<font color="#E5E5E5"> T to this prefix range know those</font>

148
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,969
kind of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to answer those kind of</font>

149
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:39,290
questions we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a long as</font>

150
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:41,540
much such so I created I my tool can

151
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,248
construct the routing table using

152
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">publish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and like if we are</font>

153
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:54,050
specifying pier<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19 and look up for one</font>

154
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:59,269
address then it's going to be like this

155
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:00,270
and we can help we can specify as a file

156
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,290
like

157
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:08,130
the file contains the full address then

158
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:11,699
look up one by one then some of the

159
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:19,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">prophets address is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not found in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

160
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:22,050
relative so what we can do is now we can

161
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:27,750
compare the rich ability if the

162
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">left-hand side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierre actually blocks</font>

163
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:37,110
the readability all mode we can consult

164
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:44,070
so I extended<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marks like if the plus</font>

165
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:47,280
is appear then it is reachable but it's

166
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:53,600
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right Pierre kind of like</font>

167
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:57,000
that and if the prefix is in left and

168
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,530
have not found in the right side then

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:08,520
it's going to be this is the greater

170
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:12,150
done right this time is shown and after

171
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:16,220
that may be partial route can be found

172
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:26,850
then it's going to be using the right

173
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:30,120
parenthesis so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yes it is I thought</font>

174
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:41,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right parenthesis is directing</font>

175
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:45,780
to the right in not not edgy like so

176
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:48,750
it's a gent gently right you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

177
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,170
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know her stay but so this</font>

178
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:59,280
is the example so if we are comparing

179
00:12:52,170 --> 00:13:02,280
our isp and another region this prefix

180
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,560
is only in the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 but we have some</font>

181
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,689
partial routes so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can</font>

182
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font>

183
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:27,980
and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feature and just ignoring</font>

184
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:33,329
the partial route and filtering the

185
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:38,160
missing missing route like the left side

186
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:44,360
left hand side is our route and right

187
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:49,680
hand is older other peers that is

188
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:54,420
existing in this file so the this is to

189
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,780
compare the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entity's route with each of</font>

190
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:03,329
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rod</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what I wanted to</font>

191
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:07,260
do and these are the missing in the

192
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:11,040
entity the prefix missing in the MTT

193
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:15,180
routing table like the there was kind of

194
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:23,060
60 peers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file some of them were</font>

195
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:26,939
empty but the 38 of those peers have

196
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:32,160
this perfect but the entity doesn't have

197
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:37,590
so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

198
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:41,870
difference in for protein table and if i

199
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:45,090
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we unique by the organization name</font>

200
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:49,130
this is the ranking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the organization</font>

201
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:52,680
name like the first one is the sum

202
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:58,470
taiwan network and the next is the

203
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:04,380
proximity from<font color="#CCCCCC"> romania i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confirmed those</font>

204
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:07,740
two prefixes or the organization is can

205
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:14,130
be found in the global routing table of

206
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:18,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entity but somehow in the Oregon's</font>

207
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:23,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">route view is not having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DA</font>

208
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:29,529
rods so even in one isp there would be

209
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:32,420
some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> versions and if we were</font>

210
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:35,260
focusing on the route few organs

211
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,969
throughout the routing table then

212
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,420
there's a difference between the global

213
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:47,440
entity routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and Oregon's route</font>

214
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:51,459
views entity routing table so I didn't

215
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:56,120
check about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third but for the fourth</font>

216
00:15:51,459 --> 00:16:00,979
this is kind of eye catching so the I

217
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask talented entity operators to track</font>

218
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,490
down why's that we don't have this time

219
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,760
warner cable's profits it is confirmed

220
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:14,120
that in also in the global routing table

221
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:23,240
some of the profits is not there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

222
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:29,150
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are asking and also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun as for</font>

223
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:30,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> voxel t in from Romania some of the</font>

224
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,120
asian network doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reach</font>

225
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:37,959
ability to the voxel t even though the

226
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:42,740
NTDs global routing table have it

227
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:47,060
because they set the community tag which

228
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:52,250
that means do not advertise in<font color="#CCCCCC"> asia so</font>

229
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:55,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm wondering this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the original</font>

230
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:59,930
intention of that vogue city itself to

231
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,290
set these tags not to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rich</font>

232
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:06,379
ability to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> rgr network so we might</font>

233
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:10,928
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contact the boxes these</font>

234
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,929
operators about this

235
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:19,369
and there are some other nice features

236
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,520
like if we are concerning about the

237
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:28,669
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of roads in the full routing</font>

238
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:32,120
table we can have easily we can show the

239
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:35,440
number of routes in many<font color="#CCCCCC"> rebel files</font>

240
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,590
like if we are specifying multiple files

241
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,370
then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shown like this</font>

242
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:45,860
one line per rip file so that and

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">timestamp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first one and this is</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pa1 disappear to disappear three so</font>

245
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:59,750
that we can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> create this kind of</font>

246
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:07,010
figure like this is a ph 0 this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PR</font>

247
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">1 and so on no and this is another</font>

248
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:20,240
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the analysis we we compare</font>

249
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:28,280
the two rib files from a different time

250
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:31,820
and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same pier we compare</font>

251
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the difference of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution in</font>

252
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:48,290
prefix length so the like in from<font color="#CCCCCC"> August</font>

253
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:57,110
12 and to august 13 / 16 is decreased 47

254
00:18:48,290 --> 00:19:01,430
x 47 and / 23 increase in 66 this is

255
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:08,439
like that and yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another from</font>

256
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">August 13 to August 14 the / 24 is</font>

257
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:21,800
increased in 500 and we can we can which

258
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:25,110
is arbitrary time range like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

259
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:29,659
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what real values</font>

260
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:38,760
so that we this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one week range</font>

261
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:43,740
including those two days so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I'm concerned creating these kind</font>

263
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:55,170
of figures because it depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

264
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:59,700
PID is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the same PR identity</font>

265
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:03,200
I mean the if the entity is a pier 19 in

266
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,770
the previous filed and in the next file

267
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:13,169
the entity is also the pier 19 but

268
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:15,750
sometimes the pier is changing this is

269
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:20,070
the implementation issue of the quagga<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

270
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:29,880
think but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> searching for entity</font>

271
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:34,460
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file for ya this is the output</font>

272
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:38,340
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three rave files one is the</font>

273
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">2020 and PR 20 and pier 21 is the entity</font>

274
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:46,379
but sometimes 21 22 19 20 so in this

275
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:51,450
case it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more harder to</font>

276
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:54,240
create those minor<font color="#CCCCCC"> features and as a</font>

277
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:59,100
discussion the first line is the the

278
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:03,750
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pier number is changing and in</font>

279
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:07,080
doing the full route rolling table you

280
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:11,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I run into some philosophical</font>

281
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:15,659
question like what is the BGP routing

282
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:21,710
table even in one isp there is a version

283
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:29,820
of depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area or region so</font>

284
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:32,820
maybe the common set of the a mini

285
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:38,510
version of the is from the ISP or the

286
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:47,780
among the ISPs might be interesting I

287
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:53,270
thought in the random thought and I'm

288
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:58,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking that we can evaluate the isps</font>

289
00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:03,629
quality of routing by comparing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font>

290
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:07,910
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant table but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

291
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:13,530
how exactly like just differing two rods

292
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:18,920
would make you run into some detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

293
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:23,280
specific case debugging so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

294
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:29,580
what is the we can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is good what</font>

295
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:33,410
this is but for this kind of thing and I

296
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:37,379
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is already</font>

297
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:42,660
contributing in some sense like we

298
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:47,460
triggered us for our specific debugging

299
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:50,250
for specific routes from the out of this

300
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:56,010
tool so that I think the tool is already

301
00:22:50,250 --> 00:23:02,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 official I think features to be added</font>

302
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:06,510
is like really regular expression in a

303
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:11,129
spa and also regular expression possibly

304
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:16,790
on next ops this is suggested by mr.

305
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:20,790
John camp and also i heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

308

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone was saying drinker but I don't</font>

310
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:42,650
remember these these kind of it feels

311
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:45,920
might be contributing helpful I think

312
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:51,470
and also we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a neighbor</font>

already in the keypad so you can use

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:48,970
from now on thanks do we have any

325
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,969
questions comments

326
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,409
hi Colin Petrie ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ncc the issue that</font>

327
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you mentioned with the pure index</font>

328
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,330
entries varying over time and you

329
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,210
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps that's a kwaka a</font>

330
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,270
bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i I don't I don't probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bug</font>

331
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,760
but yeah well my understanding of it is

332
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,010
that depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here</font>

333
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,290
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> up although other viewers</font>

334
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been configured they get insert the</font>

335
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,060
the numbering india and the dump files

336
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,070
is always sequential so if a peer is

337
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,490
down or one who's been removed then it's

338
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,429
going to reorder itself were you seeing

339
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,200
this in situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

340
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,230
of peers were always in the index table

341
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,500
were you seeing the pier move around

342
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:43,170
with the same set of peers I didn't

343
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,140
check but I believe the number of peers

344
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:49,970
are increasing or decreasing when the ID

345
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:54,450
is changing right yeah so yeah I think I

346
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:57,680
think what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the what is</font>

347
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,680
happening I think yes

348
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:08,840
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

349
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:27,049
presentation think Rob you're next

350
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:27,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks don't move outside the box</font>

351
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my box I'm</font>

352
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:45,090
quite used to that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'll get some</font>

353
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:48,168
slides so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a little bit</font>

354
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,010
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about this draft which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

355
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:51,179
operational requirements for error

356
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,799
handling and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

357
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,360
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of history because I I actually</font>

358
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:00,720
wrote this draft in 2010 so and in 2011

359
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,490
it got published it was I took it to IDR

360
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,100
in the first meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in it then</font>

361
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,360
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to grow spilling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Crow since the</font>

362
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,980
idea was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and put forward some</font>

363
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,610
operational requirements for changes in

364
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,390
PHP error handling since then we've kind

365
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,590
of talked through a bunch those

366
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,529
requirements we've talked through a lot

367
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,209
in IDR we've reached a<font color="#CCCCCC"> point of</font>

368
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:20,429
consensus around the set of drafts their

369
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,919
solutions but still we haven't managed

370
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,870
to entirely finish off the requirements

371
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,179
draft and partially that's me and

372
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,590
partially that's that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font>

373
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,120
there's been a lot of debate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

374
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,129
especially some of the debate has been

375
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">around implementation issues from people</font>

376
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,770
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment I she build build the</font>

377
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,740
features so next slide please I think

378
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the key ideas there in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft</font>

379
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,659
have been stable for for a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

380
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,100
they're really around defining a set of

381
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,409
errors that can be defined as

382
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-critical so we don't we don't tell</font>

383
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:52,080
how the session we do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

384
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:54,090
handle instead some things that are

385
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,678
still going some errors that still

386
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,908
happen and we want to tear down the

387
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,250
session because there's no way to

388
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,929
recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it and defining error</font>

389
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,149
handling that sits between for both of

390
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:05,010
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> different approaches one being the</font>

391
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:06,600
things like treatise with drawer and

392
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,029
then the other being how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset a</font>

393
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,020
session with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least hit hit to</font>

394
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:14,640
actually carrying traffic over it when

395
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,500
we've also been through a working group

396
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,710
last call we went into ITF last call for

397
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and one of the feedbacks was the</font>

398
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,130
document wasn't very clear so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

399
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,010
since then<font color="#E5E5E5"> have also done a complete</font>

400
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:28,620
rewrite of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document to make it a lot</font>

401
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,299
clearer and it kind of suffered somewhat

402
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,590
from we had a bunch of ideas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

403
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,360
wrote those down and then they had got

404
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,520
added<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and taken away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the document</font>

405
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,600
it wasn't necessarily easily consumable

406
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,360
anymore the main clarifications were

407
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
mainly

408
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,409
thanks to Bruno I think which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is around</font>

409
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,210
defining more clearly where the

410
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,799
different scopes of errors that we we

411
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,420
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're around is it an attribute</font>

412
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,000
error is a message level error as a

413
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,470
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> level error and then I've so</font>

414
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,910
taken those and linked them back to the

415
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,679
two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of error handling behaviors</font>

416
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,920
which are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-critical and critical</font>

417
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:04,630
ones that we we had before next slide

418
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:07,059
please the other thing that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added in</font>

419
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,090
later revisions was there's some debate

420
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:12,280
around what should an operator do when

421
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,449
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long lived error that</font>

422
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,399
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do anything about</font>

423
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,140
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it's remote to you do</font>

424
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,700
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with and especially when</font>

425
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,200
that's also a critical error so the

426
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,760
session is continually<font color="#E5E5E5"> being torn down</font>

427
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,950
so we've added into two different

428
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,179
potential solutions that there seems

429
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,950
like there's some operational support

430
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,320
for from the various<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions one is</font>

431
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,330
the longleaf equation restart which was

432
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,309
called persistence before and then the

433
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,260
other is a method of last resort where

434
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,120
it is possible to say I know that there

435
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a problem on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this session I can't do</font>

436
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything about it and I would like like</font>

437
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,450
it to stay up as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a knob to be used</font>

438
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,389
in emergencies such that you can at

439
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">least retain some form of connectivity</font>

440
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:55,000
when something<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be filtered next</font>

442
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,690
all the comments that there were further

443
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,760
06 version in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 7 version there's</font>

444
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,280
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> my editorial set of changes that</font>

445
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be made as I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before we've</font>

446
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">been through working great last call on</font>

447
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,530
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's consensus here if I</font>

448
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,059
were to call it could sense based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

449
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,250
fact that no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shouts in more</font>

450
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,960
which which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was really the big</font>

451
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,700
problem before so the lack of shouting

452
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm assuming is people being happier out</font>

453
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,929
than people not caring anymore and if

454
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the case then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:24,429
be corrected<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would really like to</font>

456
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,530
publish this work because five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

457
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">i started this work and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we've</font>

458
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,960
actually we've deployed it in our

459
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,320
network we've we've learned a bit about

460
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,260
it it's in most major implementations

461
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,668
stuff that's come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work so and</font>

462
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,200
it seems kind of broken to me that we

463
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,520
have solutions published without the

464
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,290
requirements which kind of motivated

465
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,929
them necessarily reaching the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

466
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,639
of maturity so if you don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

467
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,440
should be published then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would really</font>

468
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,309
like its shell to be now if you think

469
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be problems I'd also like</font>

470
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,210
you to shout when does it last call so

471
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,770
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can progress it so I</font>

472
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,160
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is some good output for this</font>

473
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,270
working

474
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,530
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of input to this</font>

475
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,870
document from a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different people</font>

476
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:03,010
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it'd be useful to useful to</font>

477
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:08,409
record<font color="#CCCCCC"> them raise our hands Oh who's</font>

478
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:10,750
actually read the latest draft so it's

479
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,640
not yeah I think let's go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list</font>

480
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm guessing that's probably</font>

481
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,900
ready to publish but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font>

482
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:20,500
through the list and I will have a potty

483
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,780
in Prague if we do right you're all

484
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,000
invited we probably need to find a few

485
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,800
reviewers just to go make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

486
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,620
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do last call yeah</font>

487
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,379
um because it has had a major revision

488
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,669
and not many people re-reviewed exciting

489
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,000
they agreed with the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and</font>

490
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:40,810
the organs probably better yeah yeah

491
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joel yay glee um yeah I mean I think</font>

492
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,790
we'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and get some early</font>

493
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,960
feedback from well I shouldn't say early

494
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:51,790
because it should have been about two

495
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:55,690
years ago but I early feedback from the

496
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,950
routing a DS when you get when you get

497
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the point of calling it a working</font>

498
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:04,780
group last call so that we can get

499
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,880
square with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other sort of</font>

500
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,580
communities of interest on this that's

501
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,990
my only thought go perfect well I'm

502
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,220
shepherding the ID I'll document so I'll

503
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,930
also go to people who made comments

504
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,310
there and see if they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete</font>

505
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,380
list yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect you to do the</font>

506
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:22,810
routing area review on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own document</font>

507
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,700
to but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we will cross this</font>

508
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,409
bridge when we get to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I don't</font>

509
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a huge problem it's</font>

510
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,760
just we have some work to do there

511
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,340
thanks I think yeah it will probably put

512
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,260
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for last call and see make sure</font>

513
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:39,629
some people review it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call and</font>

514
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">go from there thank you magic thanks</font>

515
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:54,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">Europe go for ya I was going to do the</font>

516
00:32:52,550 --> 00:33:01,310
other one but I'm toggling through the

517
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:03,920
screen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's go so this talk</font>

518
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:06,260
is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some time stamping with</font>

519
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,800
in BGP so this is a work that we started

520
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">in idea so the first version was</font>

521
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,760
presented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Toronto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

522
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">presenting yesterday some updates but</font>

523
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,530
I'm pretty convinced that I at least

524
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:25,760
some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work is really kind of</font>

525
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:29,830
operations of of PGP so some it's it's

526
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,360
really important to present it here also

527
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:37,399
so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem that we are</font>

528
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:40,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">targeting to solve today we are sending</font>

529
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:44,120
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths within the BGP control planes</font>

530
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:47,000
and sometimes we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our propagating</font>

531
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,949
are propagated quite quickly sometimes

532
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,370
not and we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any machinery that</font>

533
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:58,970
is able to monitor this kind of

534
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:02,419
performance of the BGP control<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane so</font>

535
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:05,750
what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do here is to</font>

536
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:10,010
provide some kind of time stamping

537
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:13,880
within the BGP control plane and let so

538
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:18,470
we are creating sort of time stamp

539
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:21,260
vector with in BGP so if I'm positioning

540
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:24,409
at some PT<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is receiving</font>

541
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,050
something I'm able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive all the</font>

542
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:31,940
information about what has been the

543
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:34,640
propagation time at each bgp speaker so

544
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:39,440
next slide please so why it is important

545
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:42,980
today for I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important</font>

546
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:47,720
reason is bgp back propagation is really

547
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:49,310
important for convergence<font color="#CCCCCC"> it about you</font>

548
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,259
don't agree

549
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:55,110
it depends on shore service for example

550
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,600
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some will chicas VPN you</font>

551
00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:00,840
need to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to be able to</font>

552
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,360
join the tree and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

553
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,550
send it very quickly this is a well of a

554
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,890
use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you have some layer free VPN</font>

555
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:12,330
and you are relying on convergence

556
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:17,600
because you at least your essay is not

557
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:17,600
too much critical so you can rely on it

558
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:24,180
your bgp update must not take at least

559
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:28,940
hours or minutes to be received by the

560
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:33,810
receiver node don't smile it's happening

561
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:36,060
so we are clearly facing some issue in

562
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:39,029
operational networker<font color="#CCCCCC"> life at large</font>

563
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,040
scale with bgp propagation time so it

564
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds really important for us to to be</font>

565
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to monetize it's becoming more and</font>

566
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">more critical because we are more and</font>

567
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:53,970
more services that are using bgp so we

568
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,210
are before we have we had only internet

569
00:35:53,970 --> 00:36:00,240
then we add a layer free VPN now we are

570
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:03,780
doing layer to VPN VPN multicast VPN

571
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,410
using bgp and from an operational point

572
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,780
of view as operator we would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

573
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,589
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mix all of them in the same</font>

574
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,400
boxes for capex reason an optimal cost

575
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,800
optimization so it's really important to

576
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,960
to ensure that by mixing this all is

577
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,270
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> working fine because all the</font>

578
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,060
different services as have different

579
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:30,810
priorities on a critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> some are less</font>

580
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:34,170
critical so we need some tool to be able

581
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:39,060
to monitor is so the good behavior of

582
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:41,490
the control plane next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide solve the</font>

583
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:45,529
requirements so we need something to be

584
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:49,830
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor performance in term of i</font>

585
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:52,530
would say orchestration i will need

586
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:55,860
something that is really simple I don't

587
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:59,130
need I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to establish multiple</font>

588
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:02,490
session to each bgp pier and then try to

589
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,860
correlate information by

590
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,569
okay i know my topology I know that this

591
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a first-half effectiveness is a</font>

592
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:12,480
second one so this one need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive</font>

593
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,210
the information first and via ye it's

594
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,470
really complex its complex within an IAS

595
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:21,600
and if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in in TI es</font>

596
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:25,470
nada it's even more complex so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

597
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,240
want is ok I'm triggering some pub at

598
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of a network and i want to</font>

599
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,799
receive the informations at some

600
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,069
different point of listening and then

601
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">being able to analyze what's happening</font>

602
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:40,590
in the past propagation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

603
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of listening is something that is</font>

604
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds really important the other point</font>

605
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:51,150
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to as i said be able to gather</font>

606
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:54,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is happening in</font>

607
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">between so at each bgp speaker and for</font>

608
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,160
sure we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite</font>

609
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:03,990
accurate in terms of being able to

610
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:06,750
measure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tempe next slide so</font>

611
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,000
the solution what we sow so shall you

612
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,240
are currently proposing inner in idea is

613
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,900
based on a new bgp attribute which is

614
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,970
called bgp time stamp which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

615
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:24,420
vector so each PGP speaker that will

616
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:26,779
receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path and we send it to to</font>

617
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:31,050
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other bgp speaker will add some</font>

618
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:35,520
information about when it received<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

619
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:38,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">information and when this send operation</font>

620
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,859
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been done or so to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next pgpr to</font>

621
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:44,759
the net bzip speaker so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

622
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:47,279
the diagram here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see one</font>

623
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,800
is sending a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp update for specific</font>

624
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,680
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's adding some bgp timestamp</font>

625
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,369
information and then each speaker in

626
00:38:52,680 --> 00:39:00,450
between so originator<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the listening</font>

627
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:04,320
point we'll add a subsequent information

628
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:08,580
within a witch in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vector next slide</font>

629
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,920
please so for sure the scope we are

630
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:15,119
targeting is not to timestamp everything

631
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,410
ah at least in my opinion this is not

632
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,830
necessary

633
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:24,450
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> already had some internal machinery</font>

634
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:26,520
to try to measure office bgp propagation

635
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:30,000
time within a live network without using

636
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,130
such extension but<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complex</font>

637
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,970
butter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

638
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:39,150
is currently working and what we see

639
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:41,939
that by using some pubs so I'm sending

640
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">some prefixes sometimes so I'm sending</font>

641
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">withdrawing Sam Dean withdrawing from</font>

642
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,879
different point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and we</font>

643
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,950
are doing some sampling and it's

644
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:55,470
providing already practical information

645
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:57,689
so we want social solution is retarget

646
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:00,240
to to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some very specific</font>

647
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:03,960
prefixes that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a send on which one</font>

648
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,859
and something sounds too to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

649
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:11,400
solution for for the measurement so next

650
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,830
slide so for sure we want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

651
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,500
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to run into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a yes because for</font>

652
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,840
example in our use case with owning

653
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,440
multiple a a season we want to be able

654
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:28,560
to multiply propagation time between

655
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:30,360
aces we considered some kind of my if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

656
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,029
don't know if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say with security</font>

657
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,040
issue but sometimes you may issue are

658
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,830
talking to a partner for example you

659
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to expose your internal</font>

660
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">topology on your internal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp so</font>

661
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:46,830
we are providing some ability to drop

662
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:49,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp information or aggregate</font>

663
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:51,870
the information to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the time</font>

664
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,880
stamp with in my network is just the

665
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,790
entry point and the last point on you

666
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,860
are hiding something all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

667
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:01,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">between so since something that we are</font>

668
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently considering so depending of</font>

669
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,770
the use case it's useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not this is</font>

670
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can we can discuss</font>

671
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:14,310
next slide please so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step so at</font>

672
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,080
least as a service provider wishing that

673
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,630
is this is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

674
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessary to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to monitor his</font>

675
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:27,040
performance in term of solution we are

676
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,740
proposing a solution

677
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,200
is it a good solution or not service is

678
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:35,979
something that we can we can discuss it

679
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe some some pros and cons so we are</font>

680
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:41,850
clearly welcoming your feedback about

681
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:44,620
this an interim of work the question is

682
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:48,700
do we still need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue this work</font>

683
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,560
on idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to own at least</font>

684
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,870
maybe the problem statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

685
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,690
requirements in this working<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

686
00:41:52,870 --> 00:42:00,450
split with solution and encouraging

687
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:03,840
maybe in idea personally I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care so</font>

688
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,839
this can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be discussed</font>

689
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:16,130
Doug Montgomery so are you proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

690
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,190
timestamp things upon receipt or upon

691
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:23,390
best path selection and transmit receive

692
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:26,480
and transmission today both we started

693
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:29,930
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> only receiving an intern toe we had</font>

694
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,530
some comments that doing it also in the

695
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:35,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">selling process is useful so we added</font>

696
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:38,680
actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the only place</font>

697
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:41,450
that it's useful or at least you know a

698
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:47,569
route could sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ribbon for weeks</font>

699
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:50,990
until it's selected as best bad I agree

700
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,450
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but as I mentioned the target</font>

701
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:58,189
is really to have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of POD</font>

702
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:59,990
prefixes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they will be received</font>

703
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:08,570
and automatically selected as the best

704
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:15,669
path and exported you see see the

705
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:15,670
questions any other feedback

706
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,910
did he present this an idea already yes

707
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,308
well first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in Toronto and yesterday</font>

708
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:30,730
also for you including your data and

709
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:36,089
posted your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dates so it's only for probe</font>

710
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:41,790
prefixes this is what I'm targeting but

711
00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:44,529
we can discuss I'm open do you see a

712
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:47,710
really interest to do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for</font>

713
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:51,609
all your prophecies well not all but

714
00:43:47,710 --> 00:44:00,520
some that are actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> praefectus sure why</font>

715
00:43:51,609 --> 00:44:03,549
not you can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it maybe that's</font>

716
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,250
an interesting question I mean it works

717
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,319
with book right so you're just proposing

718
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:10,660
an attribute that if you've dropped it

719
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,920
in a path that was for a real prefix it

720
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,920
would do its thing

721
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,540
will you well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for the</font>

722
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,030
production prefixes actually what you

723
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:29,120
would be looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> how old all those</font>

724
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,640
are you don't want you don't want the

725
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:35,509
production prefixes flipping around all

726
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,850
the time and this and demonstrating and

727
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:47,150
demonstrating how well you are doing the

728
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:49,029
conversions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I think we need to</font>

729
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:52,250
probably talk offline about it and

730
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:56,320
decide on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our way forward and so we will</font>

731
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to you okay sure thang said it</font>

732
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,320
right

733
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:18,319
I'm straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> am from list so the problem</font>

734
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:20,598
definition document in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honolulu be</font>

735
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,959
presented a individual draft version of

736
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:27,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and subsequent to that in grow its</font>

737
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:30,198
it's been accepted as a working group /

738
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:32,779
draft so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the work working</font>

739
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:36,349
group group dropped version<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide</font>

740
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:43,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so compared to the previous</font>

741
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:45,829
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diffs are we have added two</font>

742
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:48,410
new types of route leaks and that was

743
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:51,529
based on comments that we received in

744
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:54,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hallway in Honolulu from and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ray as</font>

745
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:56,660
well as Brian Dixon essentially they

746
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,319
thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previously the five</font>

747
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:03,348
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> route lakes that that that we</font>

748
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">we did the classification earlier we put</font>

749
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:07,789
it in five different categories or types

750
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:09,979
they thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be more</font>

751
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:12,259
complete if we looked at some other work

752
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:14,808
and and thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and and and</font>

753
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:18,349
see if that that list is complete or

754
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:21,079
something could<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be added and we</font>

755
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:24,799
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> also added several relevant new</font>

756
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:27,739
references next like this so we had

757
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:31,929
types 1 through 5 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font>

758
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:36,289
and described<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Honolulu and since then</font>

759
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:42,529
56 and 57 odd new again motivated by

760
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:45,049
comments from Andrea and Brian type 6 we

761
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:47,660
can I guess go to the next slide this is

762
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:49,459
my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide just to give you what is</font>

763
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:53,629
new in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the new version of the</font>

764
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:57,379
draft type 6 is a leak of provided

765
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:59,599
prefixes to peer so this is this happens

766
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,539
when an offending a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sleeker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font>

767
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,380
routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned from its parameter</font>

768
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:09,499
provider to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack to a lateral peer and</font>

769
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:12,979
type 7 is a leak of peer prefixes to a

770
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:15,799
provider so typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the prefix has</font>

771
00:47:12,979 --> 00:47:19,910
originated from a customer cone goes to

772
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:21,800
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and the ISP gives it to appear</font>

773
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:24,020
and then that

774
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,110
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be transmitting it upward</font>

775
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:29,360
toward towards the provider so so so

776
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:32,330
these two types have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> added and just</font>

777
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,020
like we had real real world the incident

778
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:38,840
examples for each of the previous five

779
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:43,390
types there are such examples for these

780
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:46,520
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so type 6 what Jarrod Mar chops</font>

781
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:49,970
where he sees three ISPs in a sequence

782
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:55,670
in the a s path so some of those are

783
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:58,339
type 6 kind of leaks and type 7 if you

784
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:01,340
take for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dodo Telstra</font>

785
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:03,950
example the prefixes that a whole bunch

786
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,290
of thousands or hundreds of thousands of

787
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:10,189
prefixes that dodo passed on to Telstra

788
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:12,590
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> included not only the prefixes that</font>

789
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:17,180
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learnt from providers but also</font>

790
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:20,600
from from peers so so so that I believe

791
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:23,690
like makes it reasonably look good in

792
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,430
terms of classification based on all the

793
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,970
real world incidents that that we have

794
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:35,060
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to cat a cat log and and look</font>

795
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:37,339
at over the last several years and so if

796
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I mean I'm sure there can be</font>

797
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,750
other definitions of route leaks leaks

798
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,189
which are not included here but we

799
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:47,810
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are critical they</font>

800
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:50,570
have made news every now and then and so

801
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,759
so based on that we have this this

802
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:57,490
classification for now and if you have

803
00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:00,080
feedback that to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this or I'll</font>

804
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:02,770
make any improvements in the draft its

805
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,770
most welcome

806
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:15,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jen ago I read the draft and I'm kind of</font>

807
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:18,650
surprised to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain the type tool</font>

808
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:20,930
you referring to stealing the internet

809
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,869
presentation because and at the same

810
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,999
time you saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as the highest pass</font>

812
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:31,339
particular interest in quincy<font color="#CCCCCC"> stealing's</font>

813
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:34,459

815
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:41,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path to the victim could not see the</font>

816
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:44,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced I oh I mean the okay so time</font>

817
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:47,509
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Miss more specifics skate again</font>

818
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:49,880
you churn with more specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence</font>

819
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:53,299
right so I think if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> referring to</font>

820
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">DEFCON I talk ah yeah you probably</font>

821
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:58,579
should say that I espouses modified it

822
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,069
probably is a different type of league

823
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:03,189
because the sub prefix is modified you

824
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:05,808
are saying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path is modified yeah</font>

825
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:09,019
in that particular case which was

826
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:12,309
described in def con tal attacker

827
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:14,448
modified<font color="#CCCCCC"> LastPass make sure that other</font>

828
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:17,989
network could not see the announcement

829
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:20,029
so did I don't think there s was in

830
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:22,189
circuit has deleted right I mean no es

831
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:25,069
was in no new no different no es was

832
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:27,799
inserted or deleted they inserted the

833
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:33,339
ISS which are on the path between the

834
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:33,339
attacker and the victim yeah that is

835
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh video actually I think I think</font>

836
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:51,190
the path the maliciously ejected

837
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:54,789
announcement was manufactured now if the

838
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:59,339
if the actual prefix that's being

839
00:50:54,789 --> 00:51:02,710
announced changes this is not leaking of

840
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:06,670
a route that somewhere it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

841
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:10,809
many it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufactured and well</font>

842
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:13,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it actually copies parts and</font>

843
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:19,329
modifies parts of announcements that are

844
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:23,410
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm-hmm does not really match my</font>

845
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:31,869
definition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> League ok so our intention</font>

846
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:35,140
was to to see if yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

847
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:38,349
be malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> leagues and if if you if a</font>

848
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:42,000
malicious t equal to happen you could

849
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:44,200
modify you could pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

850
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,150
whatever come in here you could you

851
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">could change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this up prefix to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub</font>

852
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:50,680
prefix so it could be intentional just

853
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:57,700
to make the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow through your a</font>

854
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:59,799
as in which case in which case the

855
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,859
traffic does indeed go through the a s

856
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:05,559
so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same effect as a regular</font>

857
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:07,119
leak with a full prefix so so you could

858
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">have you could have intentional or</font>

859
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,559
malicious leaks and that's where that's

860
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:17,319
where the sub prefix at the type to

861
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:19,960
comes in and then we talked about the

862
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:22,359
prefix hijacks right where that the

863
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,210
reverse path to the legitimate

864
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:27,910
destination is still available<font color="#CCCCCC"> as so</font>

865
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">there again there have been like</font>

866
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:34,899
examples like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bell dress and Iceland</font>

867
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:38,140
where the whole the prefix with the

868
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,510
whole path was leaked not so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it</font>

869
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:44,950
was hijacked but then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> China Telecom</font>

870
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:47,880
as well so it was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to</font>

871
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:52,779
call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can call it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

872
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,250
accidentally maybe but it's not clear

873
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:56,349
that that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened though right</font>

874
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:58,390
in at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Iceland in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> china</font>

875
00:52:56,349 --> 00:53:00,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">telecom cases the routes were simply</font>

876
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:02,920
like squeezed out the wrong hole right

877
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,289
they were just leaked through there was

878
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,869
no Riya rigea nation they just paddled

879
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:10,390
on ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was filtering on both sides</font>

880
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:13,059
what's the full pathways present all the

881
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,828
believe so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> refer somebody</font>

882
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:15,910
in here knows more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that would</font>

883
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:17,440
be great if they would stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say</font>

884
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,149
something to contradict what I said but

885
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,940
I'm pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just leaked out due</font>

886
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:28,480
to poor provider filters yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

887
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:32,410
here I think you are saying in the draft

888
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:36,730
that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to list all of</font>

889
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:39,038
the league's types did you yeah it was

890
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:41,799
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> our intention to try and capture</font>

891
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,140
everything that somebody may think of as

892
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:46,119
a route leak but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at a whole</font>

893
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:48,160
bunch of incidents in if you look in the

894
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:52,569
references there are maybe approaching

895
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:56,109
30 references which which talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

896
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:59,230
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of incidents that have</font>

897
00:53:56,109 --> 00:54:00,940
been called route leaks and so we looked

898
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,630
at all those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

899
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:08,380
with categories that that describe those

900
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:12,819
my comment is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be better if</font>

901
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:21,519
we can list all the roof leaks in the

902
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop right so yeah kind of just not</font>

903
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:30,669
trying to list all the types or as we

904
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:35,769
know it kind of thing is all right I

905
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:40,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just not trying to explore</font>

906
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:42,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dennis all is you know we were at least</font>

907
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,430
yeah we didn't deliberately exclude

908
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:47,589
anything we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought that the what's</font>

909
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:50,348
being talked about as out leaks in the

910
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:55,140
press etc that that's that's what we

911
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:57,090
went by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Doug Montgomery</font>

912
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the show I understood the last</font>

913
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:01,620
comment so trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we list</font>

914
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,750
all leaks will guarantee that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font>

915
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:10,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">present a new version each time we come</font>

916
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:13,940
here but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the taxonomy was devised to</font>

917
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:16,530
look at various characteristics of

918
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,970
incidents you could choose different

919
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:20,610
characteristics so if you wanted to

920
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:24,870
differentiate things that we call type

921
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:26,760
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones where you know there doesn't</font>

922
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:29,339
appear to be path modification I mean

923
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,840
that's another taxonomy another

924
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:34,410
dimension in which you could separate

925
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:38,730
those two so there's more specific sort

926
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:44,520
of leakages and then more specifically

927
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:46,890
kaijus with path modification so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

928
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:51,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that seems to form a useful class</font>

929
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,259
distinction one could talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

930
00:55:51,940 --> 00:56:01,240
I also think there is a purpose to just

931
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,550
building a functional taxonomy of many

932
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,169
of these but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that it covers</font>

933
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,730
everything you could possibly call

934
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:11,110
rudely because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's an</font>

935
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:15,490
infinite set of things so yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

936
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:20,770
presented the the mitigation detection

937
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:22,990
mitigation draft in IDR and so so the

938
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:27,970
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had we were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

939
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:31,959
extend it to tau clicks of type 6 and 7

940
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:34,810
as well so that's that's the status of

941
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,430
the things please do let us know I mean

942
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I mean if you have some if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font>

943
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:43,690
strongly about any of these

944
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:46,060
classification put it will please send

945
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:50,850
us a message for posting<font color="#CCCCCC"> an email on the</font>

946
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">list and we'll be happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss that</font>

947
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:58,630
way thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so looks like</font>

948
00:56:55,750 --> 00:57:03,990
