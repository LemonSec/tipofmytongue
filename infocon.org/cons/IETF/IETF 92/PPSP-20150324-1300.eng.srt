54
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,469
we have two active individual documents

the review precise will be more

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,120
efficient if ulcers provide a history of

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,620
of doing that is keeping the list open

149
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:39,700
with artsy editor and getting an hour

150

see number that's it I saw that

151
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:47,120
implementation was off the agenda I had

152
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,339
some videos for that but you've you've

153
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,370
all seen that over the past few years so

154
00:11:49,340 --> 00:12:06,650
that's unless you wanna show them I'm

155

fine with finishing up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as thank you</font>

156
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:14,090
aloe I also notice that you actually are

157
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:21,949
send out some video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you want to</font>

158
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:26,900
uh to show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well yeah not</font>

159
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:28,610
for my sake of a photo we're gonna was

160
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,540
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> section on implementation</font>

161
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:38,630
and I indeed to send some videos of what

162
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:45,500
we did in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past and but I'm</font>

163
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:49,580
fine with not showing them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know maybe</font>

164
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can introduce their the sliced</font>

165
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:59,870
contact of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sure</font>

166
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:04,430
so that you can go one slide back yeah

167
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:07,430
so then for<font color="#E5E5E5"> good android yeah so we've</font>

168
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,620
implemented the paper to call on<font color="#CCCCCC"> android</font>

169
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,250
the bonfire and both on<font color="#CCCCCC"> android and iOS</font>

170
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:17,210
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same code base in case</font>

171
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:25,100
of android it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a mix of java for</font>

172
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:30,650
GUI and a c++ implementation and in case

173
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,530
of iOS objective-c with which<font color="#CCCCCC"> c++ linked</font>

174
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:36,110
against that

175
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:38,540
that works very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well also a fairly</font>

176
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,660
energy energy efficient if you compare

177
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:48,620
it to client service streaming so that

178
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:50,569
was a nice nice project you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play</font>

179
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,370
the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you want to move on to the</font>

180
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:58,250
next one yeah what we also did is built

181
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,910
a brilliant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox again using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

182
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:09,140
same code base and a bunch of JavaScript

183
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:14,420
to actually have a a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PPS p colon handler</font>

184
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,010
built into firefox and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually at</font>

185
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,870
the time we're participating with the

186
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:23,050
wikimedia foundation they were very

187
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in doing peer-to-peer host of</font>

188
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:29,900
of the videos on<font color="#E5E5E5"> wikipedia so we could</font>

189
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:35,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built some hooks</font>

190
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:38,360
for us into production wikipedia such

191
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:41,569
that if you had our plugin installed it

192
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,370
would check if there was a and then

193
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,410
working you to visit a page to that

194
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,750
video he played<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

195
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,969
actually check if there was a

196
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,770
peer-to-peer swarm available for that

197
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">video and if so I would join that swarm</font>

198
00:14:53,770 --> 00:15:02,860
to play back the video so that was a

199
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:06,200
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice very nice cooperation and</font>

200
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:10,300
finally a bit of hacking I was also

201
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,550
serious we did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work with</font>

202
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">pioneer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the BBC on set of boxes but</font>

203
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">at one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point a particular model samsung</font>

204
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">TV became available which actually at</font>

205
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:29,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux running on the inside so we</font>

206
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:31,280
managed to get our pay protocol engine

207
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,739
on to the actual TV sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ARM</font>

208
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,400
processor in there and so we compiled it

209
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,750
for arm and were actually two were

210
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,410
actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer</font>

211
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:45,590
straight on the television which was a

212
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,910
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice I think we do they did</font>

213
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:51,950
five megabits per second without<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

214
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,360
without any problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> five megabits per</font>

215
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:59,590
second HD without any problems that was

216
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty pretty nice achievement</font>

217
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,230
yeah so that's that's basically it a lot

218
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,550
of stuff has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been done there there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

219
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,760
two companies I know of that are

220
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:14,750
currently building a product based on

221
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:21,110
the PA protocol so that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

222
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:29,510
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay senkki lon oh and thank you</font>

223
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:31,970
for even a new questions and comments so

224
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have questioned my question is</font>

225
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:40,490
your implementation on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samsung TV is</font>

226
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:44,270
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial product our test lab it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

228
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:52,880
actually built a<font color="#E5E5E5"> second box a set of box</font>

229
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,610
was built by pioneer that also ran the

230
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:01,310
pier protocol engine and we tested that

231
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:06,670
in the field with with a small village

232
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,669
somewhere down in Lancaster England and

233
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:16,880
with the BBC content so that was sort of

234
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,760
production within view people's homes

235
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:26,630
and measuring quality of experience and

236
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:31,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the type of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so any</font>

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:05,129
those their report so tracker could

287
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:07,769
desire for a while and<font color="#CCCCCC"> l and then let</font>

for future extensions disciplines this

318
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:05,879
is my element awesome a small correction

319
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:09,720
native prefix in the current version we

320
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:13,910
haven't done the update updation update

321
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,560
yet Alyssa here the first one is that

335
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:15,720
are some description issues as well so

336
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,440
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the work that I need you to less</font>

338
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,320
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step is do we have any</font>

339
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:27,590
further questions for your comments on

340
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:33,659
this job and maybe we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a we need a</font>

341
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:38,939
quick updating<font color="#CCCCCC"> then for Eddie view so</font>

342
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:46,940
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell's whole things about</font>

344
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:59,430
any comments questions like you I want

345
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:03,060
to verify that if there is a quick

346
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:12,270
update version do they still need wine

347

around working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group basketball are not</font>

348
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,710
easy money then it depends on the

349
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:19,110
updates if its updates resulting out of

350
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:21,270
the last call then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

351
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,639
last call this version anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

352
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,230
updates that are not covered by what has

353
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,010
been found a desk all then you need to

354
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:31,530
repeat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess in ratios</font>

355
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:36,210
presentations are updated is mainly

356
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:39,810
under some some texts are description

357
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:44,580
things it doesn't over too much under

358
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:47,159
protocol itself no so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

359
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,379
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like just minor Corrections what</font>

360
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:59,670
he can do is a very very short last

361

hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone this is our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set and I'm</font>

365
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:37,900
Faison from beijing jiaotong university

366
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:41,750
and basically today i want to show some

367
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,690
results about uch of PB sv system in

368
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:48,890
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of simulation implementations so</font>

369
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,900
next piece so we party included the

370
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:56,990
first one is a simulation implementation

371
00:26:50,900 --> 00:27:00,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay next one okay basically we can buy</font>

372
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:03,679
several software together and including

373
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,110
the aam net I night and oversee is we

374
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,980
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish a feature and</font>

375
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:13,189
extensible indentation simulation

376
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,100
scenario so two points we want to

377
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:18,520
achieve the first one is and simplicity

378
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,580
in terms of the high degree of

379
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:25,610
modularity and availability on top of

380
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:30,490
the multiple tcp/ip protocol stack in

381
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:33,969
the large scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next one please and</font>

382
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:38,510
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the module art architecture</font>

383
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:43,250
the first one is scalability we want to

384
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:45,530
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of notes or large topology</font>

385
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:50,620
of the network and we also want to

386
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:55,668
support interactive GUI we can you know

387
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:59,020
see or check or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topology changing</font>

388
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:01,700
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> package sending or receiving and</font>

389
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:07,190
what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on inside the routing</font>

390
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:10,400
tables so about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motos sorry we</font>

391
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:14,150
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support you know the a</font>

392
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,260
lifetime turn and the power to turn so

393
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:23,590
statistics is also very critical for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

394
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:28,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay next one question yeah so we have</font>

395
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:30,949
involved a some chair mode or like if

396
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,110
the pier is a mobile no

397
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:36,510
well yeah is this very important but

398
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:40,290
foot for this one we only consider about

399
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:42,960
the static static scenario from not this

400
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:47,340
time maybe next one we want to further

401
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:51,780
our investigation thank you basically

402
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:55,889
this is the generic mode mode modular

403
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:59,220
for the Hopi PSP season we have a

404
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:04,080
tracker we have peers cedar we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> pure</font>

405
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">liter and we have sub several blocks for</font>

406
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,850
example for the memory we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

407
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,730
a memory to hold all the content you

408
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive you want to transmit and we also</font>

409
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the pier state including the</font>

410
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,129
register and the downloading and

411
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:24,120
uploading like pure information

412
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:28,830
including your IP address your IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID and</font>

413
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:33,570
the constant manager is will be in

414
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:36,689
charging and in charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the what kind</font>

415
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,240
of content you want to to have what kind

416
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:43,200
of resources like the video like the

417
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,920
file or other things and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it use</font>

418
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:52,680
these this bar to show you know the

419
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom layer protocols right we also has</font>

420
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:59,580
several timers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

421
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:05,370
functional and the performance testing

422
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:07,710
next one piece yeah we implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font>

423
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,899
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show a star in our work</font>

424
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,360
including the one tracker and<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose</font>

425
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">either and the several liters so</font>

426
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:25,620
constantly the topology scale is 550 550

427
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:28,140
+ 250 peers we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show the</font>

428
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:32,820
different scale and now dislike being

429
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,250
phaser and ask we only show the static

430
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,639
topology and we want to show the dynamic

431
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:42,840

432
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,830
the the simple case second one next one

433
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,580
that please

434
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:53,699
okay this is for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 and next one is</font>

435
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:56,250
for a 240 50s yep and basically this is

436
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,309
the several<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters for the hard way</font>

437
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:03,990
are we running the simulation on top of

438
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:08,190
the seat the CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I 52.5 degrees earth</font>

439
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:11,159
and 4g ram and software this is the

440
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:14,940
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that I net over same</font>

441

and operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system for the parameter</font>

442
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,360
about the PPS position we including the

443
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:26,779
file size swamp size the term sighs keep

444
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,939
alive blah blah next one piece okay and

445
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:33,570
for this picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to show the</font>

446
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,320
events right events means you can see

447
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:40,139
here this is even number<font color="#E5E5E5"> six we filled</font>

448
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,519
several events not<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant to be you</font>

449
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:49,439
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the final results so you can see</font>

00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">pure Bureau sending something to the</font>

and the pier one sending the number

seven event to be a tracker<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

454
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,809
clearly see beyond the latency is quite

455
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,130
different and the corresponding

456
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:10,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledgement from the tracker you can</font>

459
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:25,559
and you can check the detail about them

460
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:29,039
next one piece and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:08,669
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> two the the red one and the blue</font>

this is a liter how many packet they

476

477
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:25,919
the future work right it's like we

478
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:30,270
didn't add any a dynamic parameter like

479
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,309
the charm like the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameter</font>

480
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:36,740
changing like the banner is like latency

481
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:39,750
so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know include the this</font>

482
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:43,260
variation<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the next version of</font>

483
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:46,470
simulations we also want to support the

484
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:49,440
live streaming so now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only about</font>

485
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:53,490
the file transmission so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

486
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,809
final target for the PB sv and we also

487
00:33:53,490 --> 00:34:01,429
want to support the welists and the net

488
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:17,009
so thank you so much any questions and

489
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:20,010
comments and comments basically I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

490
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,130
questions is a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marting it's like</font>

491
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:26,030
it's called the what the working group

492
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:29,610
is closing so who will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in charge</font>

493
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:33,570
about the individual drafts so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

494
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:41,070
want to call for you know last call who

495
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:43,500
should weigh not intimating<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

496
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,110
there's nobody left who can make us

497
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,418
cause it's nice cause you<font color="#CCCCCC"> only can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

498
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">a working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we can ask for</font>

499
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:57,120
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> post an updated version of the</font>

500
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,720
draft to the PSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list you can</font>

501
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:04,589
ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback okay so that means we</font>

502
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:09,509
cannot change<font color="#CCCCCC"> this raft to fear the</font>

503
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:11,490
working group draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no my</font>

504
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:17,370
understanding is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do</font>

505
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:20,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">some meat to user to a RC editor for</font>

506
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:24,650
requesting their review and publication

507
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:29,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">all therefore there will be a right</font>

508
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:35,540
there's our be some regulars<font color="#CCCCCC"> chi to</font>

509
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:39,240
regulate how to proceed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

510
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:42,150
this will hear from Samsung stock

511
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,580
restoration SS is small like a speaker

512
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:49,800
so for this should not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine</font>

513
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:52,500
the microphone so for this is a software

514
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,730
open source I mean the PPS p<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

515
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:59,280
finishing in this way well based based

516
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:02,490
on my understanding PPS be he is trying

517
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to figure out how to support you know</font>

518
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:08,910
peer-to-peer streaming transmission is

519
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:11,460
like but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our task we just want to</font>

520
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:14,520
implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top of</font>

521
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:21,350
simulation scenario or simulation

522
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:25,310
software this is our ok so somebody easy

523
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:29,160
what now it's not you know the software

524
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,900
because we haven't finished all the work

525
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,109
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's not</font>

526
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,910
available for the community but when we

527
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,910
finish we want to put this online

528
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:47,129
tradition so is there a reference

529
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:51,480
software include issue obviously and its

530
00:36:47,130 --> 00:37:07,430
people for<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no yes please oh ok ok ok</font>

531
00:36:51,480 --> 00:37:17,609
ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks any other questions thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

532
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:23,220
thank you fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I think we have</font>

533
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:29,299
finished all the proposed an agenda from

534
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:34,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">the receptive city they have finished</font>

535
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:39,890
the path<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Latin word math word</font>

536
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,890
and should be on as we have suggested

537
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:51,390
and in submission through or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kiev</font>

538
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:54,900
computation so if you have any questions

539
00:37:51,390 --> 00:38:05,779
comments peace process I don't hesitate

540
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:05,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> post questions and problems and</font>

541
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:18,509
matting would you would you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

542
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:20,430
some words either closing relax so

543
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> punished emailing again so the</font>

544
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,328
thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group is officially</font>

545
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,829
not humidity closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's for process</font>

546
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:27,270
business so what we gonna do is that

547
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:30,750
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group documents are</font>

548
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:32,670
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg and risk the RFC editor</font>

549
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,640
then the vertical will be officially

550
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,730
closed that that's the simple reason is

551
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,368
that that we need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hull of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

552
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,810
working group to make the processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

553
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:50,160
the ice cream but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

554
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:52,650
documents are done p protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>
