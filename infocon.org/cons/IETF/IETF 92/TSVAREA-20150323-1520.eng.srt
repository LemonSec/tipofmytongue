00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:13,040
yes sir but like do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want I what</font>

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,969
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> go research group who wanna me</font>

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">best do we were both another workshop</font>

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,490
another goal was was better

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,820
understanding of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transport</font>

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,929
shouldn't must evolve including looking

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,429
at the applicability of present tan

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:27,698
sport statistic use cases of this sort

9
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:30,259
of was an overlap with the temple

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,609

<font color="#CCCCCC">the applications about protector in the</font>

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,230
right way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question we and hard and</font>

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,570
then and then shying away from where the

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust issues and deployment incentives</font>

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,539
and cooperation evolution approaches

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,539
right so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we've tried to do</font>

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,390
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signaling tuna path or from</font>

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the path there's always been the</font>

19
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,320
questionable how can I trust what is

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,209
said how do I know who you are how do I

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,340
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signaling has not been</font>

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,140
modified on<font color="#E5E5E5"> path and that the trust</font>

23
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,359
issue is just unless you have you know a

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,099
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the keying and key</font>

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,660
distribution problem this is hard and if

26
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,919
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,149
keying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep distribution problem</font>

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,549
then everything is easy so one of the

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,140
things we talked about was a measurement

30
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,700
so the measurement fell out relatively

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,750
early on in the discussions we didn't

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,590
spend a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time actually talking</font>

33
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,799
about measurement because there was

34
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,659
pretty clear agreement in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room as to</font>

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the next steps were and those next</font>

36
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,960
steps were more or less the Hoffs barb

37
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,970
off on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we'll talk about</font>

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,259
that in a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> but really the question</font>

39
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,640
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where we're making</font>

40
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions about the</font>

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,409
evolution of the protocol stack and

42
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:39,408
these are based on not a whole lot of

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">data we need more data if we're making</font>

44
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,229
an argument that you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be able to</font>

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,909
deploy a given protocol because it only

46
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,289
works in ninety nine point five percent

47
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:50,030
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet um you maybe we can put</font>

48
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:55,040
some effort into engineering around that

49
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,090
problem and if it breaks in five five

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,619
tenths of a percent of the internet how

51
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">much of the complete complexity to</font>

52
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,360
engineer around that is too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

53
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a trade-off here and Aaron will</font>

54
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,039
talk more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hops barb off and</font>

55
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,899
the outcomes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which is actually</font>

56
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,300
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> productive i've ever been on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

57
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,580
sunday<font color="#CCCCCC"> night at nine-thirty p.m. after</font>

58
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:19,100
four beers and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18-hour day</font>

59
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,930
um so on the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> box cooperation</font>

60
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,880
thing we spent a great deal of time

61
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,620
talking about this and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

62
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,980
discussion points the major discussion

63
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,540
points pulled into sort of three areas

64
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,010
one of them identified that essentially

65
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,329
we're talking when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about putting</font>

66
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,620
packets in the network and how those

67
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,720
pockets are handled a lot of these

68
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,370
contracts are implicit right the I'm

69
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,720
going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a syn packet and</font>

70
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,790
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up some state on</font>

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,350
your NAT and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> snap will set up</font>

72
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,630
some state or and then a syn<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACK will</font>

73
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,670
come back and then the firewall will

74
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,230
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point the other</font>

75
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint has decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is good</font>

76
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,649
and delegate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that decision these are all</font>

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,239
implicit contracts and maybe it we can

78
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,270
start tackling this problem by thinking

79
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these explicit contracts and having</font>

80
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:06,050
sort of protocol support for for setting

81
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,280
these things up explicitly another thing

82
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> came out of this discussion was</font>

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,650
that encryption provides<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool to</font>

84
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,120
enforce a balance of power between

85
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,240
endpoints in the middle one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,850
didn't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this slide is is um if we</font>

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,730
can't get cooperation<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can get</font>

88
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,049
compliance simply by weaponizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS</font>

89
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypting everything and saying</font>

90
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:28,459
good luck mucking about in the transport

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,768
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incentives</font>

92
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,150
as well its weak it does it's great to

93
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,230
define a new signaling protocol it's

94
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,519
great to say okay well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

95
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,170
engineering solution of this problem but

96
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">if there's no incentive for anybody to</font>

97
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,679
deploy it and those incentives<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

98
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,780
be incremental right so if we come up

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a new signaling protocol don't day</font>

100
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,410
one the only thing that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

101
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,090
that new signaling protocol or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

102
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,790
two boxes in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> test lab there won't</font>

103
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,530
be any middle boxes on the path and when

104
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,700
you ship it it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be endpoints</font>

105
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,860
talking so you have to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font>

106
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,290
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is actually useful for</font>

107
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:03,650
the endpoints first so that there is an

108
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:05,690
incentive to deploy in the middle so if

109
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,070
you are at the plenary in Honolulu

110
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,260
instead of going and enjoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beach</font>

111
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,040
early you've seen the two stamped

112
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,079
internet martini glass<font color="#CCCCCC"> pup yes Megan</font>

113
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,988
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about TLS being a</font>

114
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,720
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weaponized is it it</font>

115
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transvaal Heather's weight is</font>

117
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,850
inside the transporters

118
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,320
I think the hope at the time was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

119
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,090
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like TC being may cover the</font>

120
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,409
transport editor and it's decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to</font>

121
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,119
do that so we're wait so the

122
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,800
weaponization becomes a harder thing yet

123
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,080
right yeah because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

124
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp Inc discussion concluded there good</font>

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:45,260
point so let's actually do this

126
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,479
explicitly then<font color="#E5E5E5"> um in terms of</font>

127
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,789
cooperation if we have an architecture

128
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,949
where we expose what we have to to the

129
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,260
path to get what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want encrypt</font>

130
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:59,330
everything else and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

131
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:02,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else is in to end you end up</font>

132
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,729
with the spud ball so in spud we're

133
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,850
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this inter layer</font>

134
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:09,469
right here on which sort of new

135
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:16,850
transports on top of the shim layer on

136
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:18,350
top of UDP on top of ipv4 and ipv6 so

137
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,760
this is we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

138
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,650
encapsulation for path exposure in

139
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">userspace transports that'll be spud or</font>

140
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,299
substrate protocol for user data grams

141
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,889
90 on Wednesday<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the international</font>

142
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,660
room which I just looked on the map and

143
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it turns out that's the plenary room so</font>

144
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:37,280

<font color="#E5E5E5">the the application developer standpoint</font>

153
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,950
you have the user data the things that

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,090
are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the app this is none of the</font>

that you have the transport layer itself

it's running in a library regrets

171

just a set of packets um and the set of

189
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,969

<font color="#E5E5E5">something like an sctp stream they could</font>

195
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:28,700

196

channel with an extensible syntax that

197
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,750
allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take these properties and</font>

198
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,830
bind them either to the packet or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

either end point using the same in band

201
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,560
channel and we've got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drafts</font>

202
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,970
on this um that<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe first of all</font>

203
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,920
the instance the generic mechanism for

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,470
experimentation is the prototype that's

205
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,270
draft Hildebrand's bud prototype and

206
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,310
then some generic constraints for

207
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,219
signaling over UDP based encapsulations

208
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:02,090
is in draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> trammell stack evo new t for</font>

209
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,350
a new transport encapsulation the aether

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,789
is not for architecture but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i forget</font>

211
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it is and there we want to spend a</font>

212
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,280
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the vocabulary</font>

213
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so if we build a generic signaling</font>

214
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,049
mechanism the success or<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure of a</font>

215
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">generic signaling mechanism is going to</font>

216
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:25,610
UM is going to come from what you can

217
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,560
say what you should say what you must

218
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,970
say with it so when looking at this

219
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,590
there need to be incentives to expose

220
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,180
information the application has to

221
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,590
potentially get something by saying

222
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,819
something the path has to potentially

223
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,130
get something by saying something Matt

224
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,849
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to jump in or do you want to</font>

225
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:47,089
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the slide oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

226
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:50,990
and then in the workshop we split this

227
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:52,520
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of into two areas um there's a</font>

228
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,779
the app<font color="#CCCCCC"> to path area so when the</font>

229
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,870
application is telling the path things

230
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:58,939
the path to app area and we came pretty

231
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,060
quickly to a determination<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that the</font>

232
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,370
app to<font color="#E5E5E5"> path thing looks tractable wait</font>

233
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,810
there's probably a minimal set of useful

234
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,910
information things like session lifetime

235
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,469
things like this is my first packet this

236
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,149
is my last packet where you can actually

237
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,490
get some benefit by signaling it by

238
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:17,870
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take essentially the</font>

239
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:23,420
transport headers which are now up in

240
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:25,459
here inside inside spud inside the the

243
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,209

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:34,849
signaling for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer protocol but</font>

246
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,080
basic signaling for session lifetime so

247
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,209
that you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup and teardown</font>

248
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">state explicitly on these on path</font>

249
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:43,489
devices that seems um that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

250
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,740
useful and like it can it can be done

251
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,010
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is also useful to</font>

252
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the far end point there are a few other</font>

253
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,939
potential use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will get into</font>

254
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,969
at this bud Bob on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path to outside</font>

255
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,839
the way forwards a little bit less clear

256
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,880
problem might be tracked all it's

257
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,579
basically like ICMP I would be like in

258
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,670
band ICMP if we traded as advisory but

259
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:06,649
um the trust issues kind of make the

260
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,020
path signaling to the app things that

261
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,500
are mandatory very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to deal</font>

262
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,959
with so we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back to that but</font>

263
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,630
the way forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that really is much</font>

264
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,180
less clear so coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back out of the</font>

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,920
semi workshop the initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> workshop</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">out the door before Dallas I didn't make</font>

269
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,860
now which means realistically mid-april

270
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,540
until then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transcripts of slides</font>

271
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,029
position papers everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has come</font>

out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the workshop is up at idea</font>

273
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:43,010
activities workshops semi there's been

274
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,469
some cooperation with the etsy nfe forum

275
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,000
on middle box issues actually bobbed you

276
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,510
wanna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up and say like two minutes</font>

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,510
about that

278
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:59,030
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a the output the semi</font>

279
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,420
workshop there I put it out that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

280
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:04,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of things that the ed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nfe group with</font>

281
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,400
doing would get broken by into an

282
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,140
encryption and entering and pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

283
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,900
how much Indian encryption there was

284
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:16,990
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got people rather scared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:19,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">load them hadn't noticed strangely and</font>

286
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:24,860
so essentially got delegated the

287
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:28,640
security group at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> etsy nfe industry</font>

288
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,890
specification group and we wrote some

289
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,670
started to write some guidelines on how

290
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,620
to deal or how to weather and what to do

291
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:42,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you deal dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with accessing</font>

292
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:44,540
end-to-end traffic so things like

293
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,400
watching your logs to see whether you're

294
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,719
stripping not is you know getting new

295
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,030
functions that you're stripping off and

296
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,240
things like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set of functions</font>

297
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,420
so I'd quite like I've encouraged them

298
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,800
to come here with liaison to check that

299
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,699
that all seems reasonable from their

300
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,709
point of view but I think it's quite

301
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,330
nice that they're writing that because

302
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,430
it's the people who write the middle

303
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:08,210
boxes who are writing their own rules

304
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">which you know yeah yeah yeah yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

305
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,340
so that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> brief summer are you</font>

306
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,960
getting in line<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a point for here</font>

307
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,550
David yeah so one of the other things

308
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,110
good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is discussion on transport</font>

309
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,390
extensibility and area meeting so

310
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,270
basically when we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

311
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,830
this just sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how once we have</font>

312
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,290
something more concrete like basically

313
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,030
taking this out not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tsv area but</font>

314
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,870
also to apps area since it's that you

315
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:38,150
know there that the clients at this

316
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,020
there's another work item on UDP

317
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:44,240

as one of the recipient<font color="#E5E5E5"> but because when</font>

assuming that many of you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other future work is in is</font>

handled by the stacking program you can

353
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:23,359
mail it said stack evo at IEP Doug so

354
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:28,040
questions so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i come i am I looking at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual-sim dinner martini glass</font>

357
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,800
we had this whole discussion in taps

358
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,180
about real-time apps in RTP yep and so

359
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,300
it wasn't really explicitly represented

360
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,620
I'm wondering whether spewed and i was

361
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,250
told that that's what how it was

362
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:53,540
pronounced so whether spewed is actually

363
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,690
what the the RTP Cabal has it was aware

364
00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:00,270
of this if there's any big concerns or

365
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,820
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cobalt rights to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> threw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ball</font>

366
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,230
calling the ball to the microphone cool

367
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,030
thanks to power and I'll stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at</font>

368
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:12,330
once don't like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a special</font>

369
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:15,480
shirt make me the black dot it's a

370
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:19,580
secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yeah so I'm I'm Colin Perkins</font>

371
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> apparently a cappella man but um I</font>

372
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:28,470
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think spud spewed whatever</font>

373
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,910
um I think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good ideas in</font>

374
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:36,150
there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some things which can</font>

375
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:38,280
certainly we probably shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

376
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:42,720
that Bob here shouldn't have that here

377
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:46,410
um but please do in one day I don't know

378
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:51,330
um I'm not sure I understand it well

379
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:54,300
enough to to really give a good answer

380
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,860
on the fly like so we read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft and</font>

381
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,870
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday if you have time</font>

382
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,630
wednesday morning because if you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

383
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was I think planning of being being</font>

384
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:09,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok i have read the draft i think i</font>

385
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:13,230
read a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drugs i mean i think we</font>

386
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,230
have developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> its you know any God CP</font>

387
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,270
has some<font color="#E5E5E5"> different requirements because</font>

388
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,820
because that there there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

389
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,670
interest in middle boxes which actually

390
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,480
do processing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of the trust</font>

391
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,589
domain yep in RTP so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it has</font>

392
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,380
slightly different set of requirements

393
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,210
yeah some applications and that i think

394
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that spud perhaps doesn't work</font>

395
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,740
particularly well for a lot of us

396
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,020
locations one big cases maybe it would

397
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,760
one big question we would have is does

398
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,060
it make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> in those cases where there</font>

399
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:48,270
are trust relationships to be able to

400
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:50,670
represent and exploit them in spud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

401
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,470
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

402
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,979
basically what we have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of a</font>

403
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:58,440
vocabulary and a mechanism and the

404
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,270
vocabulary is only expressed at this

405
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,270
point in a meadow vocabulary of

406
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,650
constraints on the vocabulary but one of

407
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,900
the reasons those constraints are there

408
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,390
is we make an explicit assumption that

409
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,199
the trust problem is out of scope but in

410
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,569
places where you already have

411
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:19,029
those trust relationships set up and

412
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:21,129
have a generic way to UM there a

413
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:23,109
representation independent way to think

414
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">about them and represent them then we</font>

415
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,769
can certainly represent them in spot as

416
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,269
well right whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we decide that</font>

417
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scope is it discussion for</font>

418
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:32,380
Wednesday yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be a</font>

419
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,840
lot of application semantics if you guys

420
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,659
bring them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which is probably too much</font>

421
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,629
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring into a generic protocol</font>

422
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:41,799
probably but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's definitely we're</font>

423
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:50,019
definitely interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> having that</font>

424
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:52,990
discussion but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Briscoe BTW the the</font>

425
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:57,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason I went to the mic before and said</font>

426
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,659
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a case of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP versus</font>

427
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,090
UDP but there were some people who

428
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:03,610
believe both is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're</font>

429
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:08,350
getting rather too focused on spud and

430
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:10,719
UDP and actually there's also the need

431
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,959
to look at doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing as</font>

432
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,250
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing inspired in TTP for the</font>

433
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,330
cases where UDP can't get through and

434
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,889
that's particular what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing but I'm</font>

435
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,840
not doing because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think TCP is cool</font>

436
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:24,490
and UDP isn't I'm just do people have

437
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,529
got to do two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that's the</font>

438
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,100
important point that needs to be got

439
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:31,149
over and I'm looking at an inn<font color="#E5E5E5"> TTP it's</font>

440
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,860
going to have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but I'm</font>

441
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:34,840
looking at using what are currently the

442
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">TTP options to talk with middleboxes</font>

443
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,860
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that mess with</font>

444
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:42,250
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway and then putting the other</font>

445
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,439
TTP options inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp data that you</font>

446
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,159
don't want to be messed with and so

447
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,029
that's thing called in a space and so

448
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,010
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I think it's important</font>

449
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,480
to go up one level in terms of trying to

450
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,309
get consensus on what we're trying to do

451
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,500
what I've been saying or we got to go

452
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,789
down either the UTP path or the TTP path

453
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,159
because that's a that's a good point

454
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:04,779
yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would so one bit of</font>

455
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,750
hallway conversation data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

456
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I can quote but the numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

457
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,720
were quoted in terms of UDP connectivity

458
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,610
is so ninety percent of the time between

459
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,860
clients and servers you can get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV</font>

460
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">package through both ways right which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

461
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,350
and it works most of the time sort of

462
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,340
thing but ninety percent is not good

463
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,580
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

464
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,860
um for relying on it without having fall

465
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,939
back so if you're in a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

466
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,260
you can only get ninety percent of the

467
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,460
connection up then yes you need to have

468
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:38,379
a plan B make<font color="#E5E5E5"> livin it's a spudger plus</font>

469
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">one to Bob and come to the buff and</font>

470
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:45,190
let's discuss hi I'm Tim Shepherd with a

471
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:47,350
this might be a stupid or silly question

472
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,080
but at the base of your hourglass you

473
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,969
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight you said it was divided in</font>

474
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,270
because divided into two link layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> 880</font>

475
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:59,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">line and they got 80 20 2015 dot one</font>

476
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll to like ooh not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

477
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just the second time today I</font>

478
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,820
heard a door to like and I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

479
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,669
no idea what it meant yeah so we mean

480
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,149
things that kind of have so link layer

481
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:16,779
that have the properties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP was</font>

482
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:19,658
originally designed to is the so you

483
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:22,510
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of collision avoidance</font>

484
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,860
you have with the source file for now

485
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,539
I'm starting to understand you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

486
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,428
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you I don't know whether you</font>

487
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:29,440
invented that term but I i really

488
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,120
dislike it okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could be confusing I</font>

489
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,460
didn't know yeah I did invent that term

490
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,649
um I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with anything</font>

491
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,950
better if however if have a suggestion

492
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:40,809
for 60 not in the next 20 minutes I own

493
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,640
to know the slides for the for the tech

494
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,470
plenary or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up and embarrass</font>

495
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,330
me if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later in the hall</font>

496
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,190
could explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the distinction</font>

497
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,899
realize you're making an ultimate the

498
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,919
big distinction the big thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

499
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:55,330
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to capture is that LTE um can be</font>

500
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,399
pretty painful if you're making

501
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,490
decisions about if you're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 to</font>

502
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:03,010
base decisions about congestion control

503
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,890
so as LTE the poster child it'll not

504
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:10,390
able to like but let's table 2 has so

505
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:13,299
much stuff like that yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Calum</font>

506
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:17,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">basler up are you currently envisioning</font>

507
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:19,720
supporting multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> in spud because the</font>

508
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:23,049
broad definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can think of several</font>

509
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,350
uses yes yes we are we are we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

510
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,629
calling it explicitly out of scope but

511
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you look if you dig into this tube</font>

512
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:35,559
identifier there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing question</font>

513
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:37,710
about the trade-off between using a

514
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,649
single tube identifier with multi

515
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,500
five tuples which would then get you the

516
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:46,439
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do migration and multicast on</font>

517
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,600
the same tube and bind properties to a

518
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,340
single multi cast session but would also

519
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,449
give you track ability in the mobility

520
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,610
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> um versus having to be identified</font>

521
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,490
somehow linkable to each other in a way

522
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,250
that is only exposed to people who

523
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,390
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the tube identifier so this</font>

524
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,179
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that when we get it down</font>

525
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,100
into when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down into the details</font>

526
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,570
the discussion the scope of the

527
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,250
identifier is one of those things that

528
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,309
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-offs on</font>

529
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,990
and applicability to multicast use case

530
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,020
is one of the big inputs to that

531
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,960
trade-off discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well I'll try</font>

532
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:26,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hit the Bob i have a very specific</font>

533
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,350
multicast application excellent general

534
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:33,480
you know are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking more questions</font>

535
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:35,520
on spud well we should make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

536
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,190
buff because that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Plaza discuss yeah</font>

537
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,730
but that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ask the quest account</font>

538
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:45,980
yeah a point to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this isn't about</font>

539
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:49,830
spot but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bruce Cogan yeah and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

540
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,260
the the point about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttp decided not</font>

541
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,559
to make the headers or mess with the

542
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,809
transport headers that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of we need</font>

543
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to really double take what that means</font>

544
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:03,600
because we made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision that the</font>

545
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:07,770
semi workshop that we were there was the

546
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,000
possibility of middle box vendors being

547
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,179
interested in talking to us again

548
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,620
because of encryption and now they won't

549
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,070
be because encryption is not going to

550
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,750
affect them so you know should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still</font>

551
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,980
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just continuing down the path</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

552
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided because we thought something</font>

553
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,210
else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen and it isn't</font>

554
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen you know another good</font>

555
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,899
point yeah

556
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:37,139
okay so thank you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font>

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:57,840
hello case you show hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks</font>

560
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:03,580
who were at the hops barb off on Sunday

561
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so most of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually were there</font>

562
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say too much and</font>

563
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,930
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have slides so what I'm showing</font>

564
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,879
here are my notes which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font>

565
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:18,520
to use to remind me so i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss any</font>

566
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:21,870
important points so as Brian yeah put

567
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:25,480
the barb off<font color="#CCCCCC"> in good context the idea is</font>

568
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,760
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need some countries about what</font>

569
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,880

different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little boxes and they</font>

572
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,340
interfere with protocols in a variety of

573
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:44,410
ways and there's the there's not a whole

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of measurement of how they interact</font>

575
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,380
with transport protocols there's a few

576
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,320
papers out which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend some time</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about but the idea here was to</font>

578
00:24:52,620 --> 00:25:01,000
the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we tried the barb off</font>

579
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:03,970
was was to instrument some browsers on

580
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,700
fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mobile end systems to make</font>

581
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,190
active measurements to see what works

582
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,950
and doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then across the</font>

583
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,670
internet from a variety of networks

586
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,970
sort of thing the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

587
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,590
ranged from there that was sort of what

588
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,360
I put on the table was what came out of

589
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:29,560
the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the at the semi</font>

590
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,389
workshop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the goal is not to</font>

591
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,550
necessarily charter an idea for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye</font>

592
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,080
RTF activity but really just to see if

593
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,280
there was interest there in particular

594
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,919
getting engagement from people who

595
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,920
maintained stacks and browsers to see

596
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,570
about their interest in putting this in

597
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,980
and so there were a number of

598
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,919
interesting points that were made not

599
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,870
just try to touch on those very briefly

600
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:58,540
and to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a sense of what came out</font>

601
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,550
of this so one of the things that came

602
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,260
out was it seems that there's a bunch of

603
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">information that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already being</font>

604
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,870
collected

605
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,310
by some-some end systems is not

606
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,040
necessarily being made public but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

607
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,389
think that that the the energy level

608
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,550
there are about 60 folks who showed up

609
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:19,450
late on Sunday night I think will help

610
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,129
make some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information available</font>

611
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,930
so people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that stuff</font>

612
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there and so there was sort of the</font>

613
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">low hanging fruit of passive measurement</font>

614
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,490
things that are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> being collected</font>

615
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:34,419
about behaviors of browsers and it looks

616
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">like from chrome and maybe from firefox</font>

617
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,990
that there's some information from that

618
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,040
and if and and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-hanging fruit</font>

619
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,750
that maybe with a small amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort</font>

620
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:47,680
additional information could be made

621
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:49,300
available and so that's something that

622
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,620
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to find out what's</font>

623
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,600
easily available and share that in the

624
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,040
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then as we start to</font>

625
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,379
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about active collection well of</font>

626
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,409
course that takes more work not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

627
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:02,280
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you have to write the code</font>

628
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:06,700
sometimes you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you need both ends</font>

629
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:09,940
and then once you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cook you know</font>

630
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,560
collecting this data as with the passive

631
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,810
data there are privacy issues and so

632
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,149
it's important to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understand the</font>

633
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,830
risk versus reward for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but there</font>

634
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a there was a lot of interest in</font>

635
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think those</font>

636
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,879
general agreement that passive data is

637
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,050
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help you answer some</font>

638
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions localization you know one of</font>

639
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,600
the ideas was like well if you start

640
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,010
making lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these measurements from</font>

641
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,199
all over the internet now you can start

642
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well gee you know these networks</font>

643
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,990
are really screwing up the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

644
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">play new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer protocols and maybe</font>

645
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:41,320
you know shame them into improving the

646
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,700
middle box behavior surprisingly it was

647
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,169
a network operator there who said gee I

648
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,730
don't really know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> well this is</font>

649
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,370
working in my network and would be nice

650
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,840
to have a toolkit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort so i can</font>

651
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,310
understand what's broken and so that I

652
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,230
can work with my vendors to get it fixed

653
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,909
and then you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there to maybe</font>

654
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,580
having a general<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolkit that the</font>

655
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,110
vendors would use and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot</font>

656
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,419
of places where just being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

657
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,500
identify you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you can start to</font>

658
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,360
quantify what kinds of what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

659
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,070
behavior you want now people can

660
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,010
understand whether they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're able to</font>

661
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,810
provide it or not as we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

662
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,460
the privacy issues that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point came</font>

663
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,600
out that aggregated statistics are still

664
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,150
useful to under

665
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,120
stand how prevalent certain kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad</font>

666
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:24,220
behavior is will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some</font>

667
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-offs as you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at sort of</font>

668
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:31,960
the the cost benefit of doing different

669
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:33,189
kinds of of engineering and so that

670
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,180
seems like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might help us</font>

671
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:39,220
work around some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy issues</font>

672
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,690
there's a some folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ripe Atlas</font>

673
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,330
were there who talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some test</font>

674
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,600
infrastructure that they had that's a

675
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:48,820
widespread that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it this is a way of</font>

676
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing active measurements from nodes in</font>

677
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,370
the middle of the network which allows

678
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,750
you to make a certain class of

679
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,699
measurements it doesn't cover everything

680
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,240
because based on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the research</font>

681
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,910
that's been done so far cellular

682
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,220
networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> university networks in</font>

683
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:07,930
particular have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been shown to have sort</font>

684
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,880
of unusual behaviors compared to a

685
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:15,280
broader class in terms of what the

686
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,420
middle boxes are blocking and there was

687
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,740
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion about you know what are</font>

688
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,940
we shared we share descriptions of what

689
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,170
measurements to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we share the</font>

690
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,080
data I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of interest</font>

691
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:25,480
in in all the above and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

692
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,820
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little early to talk about that until</font>

693
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,260
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get some more the concrete of</font>

694
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,840
what's available and what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

695
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,610
to do and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as an aside there</font>

696
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,770
was some discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing a fuzz</font>

697
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:39,429
testing where you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sin you know</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">all possible permutations of values and</font>

699
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,490

700
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn and that was I think there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

701
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,450
pretty strong consensus that that

702
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,490
because of a state of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

705
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,630

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effort little T so</font>

707
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:00,330
that's sort of that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short summary</font>

there's an engelist tops at ITF org<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

709
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,389
right now there's a the next step is

710
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,610
really sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collect and share some</font>

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,800
information and see what happens next

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,030
step but given the the interest level it

713
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,210
looks like the people are going to

714
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,190
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plug away at this and I can</font>

715
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:19,260
take some questions now<font color="#CCCCCC"> or talk to</font>

716
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:23,220
anybody offline later<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

717
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,850
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very much I think</font>

750
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:16,870
within an application and WebRTC is a

great example and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that simple</font>

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,158
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but first</font>

bit interesting CS stands for class

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,280
on that in a few slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so back to</font>

this see the comment i made in the

figured out I said earlier where do net

909
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:53,030

through this slide the next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

i'll be happy to walk back to any

00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:54,470
we let me do that and then and then come

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was just going to say it as a 6.6</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">seven foot some some initial things</font>

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point the punch line toward pilot</font>

944
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,710
dead lawyer jokes because the there's no

945
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,419
interface to ask what services are ye

946
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,550
page views are available so the net is

947
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,220
you've got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> api which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could set</font>

948
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,020
this you accept these values that

949
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,819
translate twister to request for service

950
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,550
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browser's note services are</font>

951
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:42,800

955
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,900
you what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do next good</font>

956
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,730
question how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious service levels</font>

957
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,760
well depending on which said network

958
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,410
operators on talking to uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get</font>

959
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,240
different answers on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

960
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,210
there's some fairly rich enterprise

961
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,100
networks that can ease four dozen

962
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,700
service levels I other hand I talked to

963
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,890
call carriers who say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 34 no more please</font>

964
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,710
that's that's all going to employers in

965
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,839
particular turns out to be a very strong

966
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,970

side you want to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

1000
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,450
matter I can just I didn't trouble

1001
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,529
regardless all right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw that one</font>

cover

1003
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:59,540
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is so Jenna anger</font>

1004
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,490
but this is a hard problem and and kudos

1005
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,140
to you for actually taking it on and

1006
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:08,330
plowing through this mess I have I think

1007
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:14,200
I've see here understand what you touch

1008
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:16,520
you own it means I understand I have a

1009
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:20,480
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions one of them is about</font>

1010
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,250
their use of the term DSC be when web

1011
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,110
apps are talking about dscp are they

1012
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,480
talking about actually what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would</font>

1013
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,830
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the network or are</font>

1014
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,390
they actually talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the bits on</font>

1015
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:32,029
the wire because it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're</font>

1016
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,770
jumping a layer here and it seems like

1017
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,920
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too much information</font>

1018
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:39,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> an application is trying to chew</font>

1019
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,580
off given that the application may not

1020
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,230
be aware of the congestion control

1021

right the interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> that WebRTC</font>

application uses has no concert dhcp it

00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:03,020
has a motion of the class or traffic

1026
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:05,600
it's sending and the level of service it

1027
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,370
would like for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> class of traffic the</font>

1028
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,400
browser framework is then responsible

1029
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:13,009
for mapping that interface on to the

festivus pole up here the web RTC got it

1033
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,480
right there how are some problems are

1034
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,580
trying to pull the browser framework

1035
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,370
because you know what's out there yeah I

1036
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,509
understand so so in you said a few

extensive conversations with the sctp

<font color="#CCCCCC">atf rough consensus which is doable HTTP</font>

when some major experience with what's

actually that happen how it's actually

1057
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,869
answer is no and the fundamental reason

00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">Juan is that the esses to them one is</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SU teep a congestion control context</font>

1060
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:24,930
is the whole sessions not stream by

1063
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,460
didn't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> them i'll be streaming I said</font>

1064
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,410
multihoming that is experience that we

1065
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,540
have with using multiple network

1066
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,118
interfaces inside of one HTTP connection

1067
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:41,099
each network interface is a separate

1068
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,500
condition control context you can have a

1069

whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sctp streams mapped into</font>

1079
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,020
details of how this works out the

1080
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">conclusion we did work in the dart draft</font>

1081
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,130
is there's some tension for that that

1082
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,390
the estimates that there is potential

1083
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:16,589
particularly for the local drop whoops

1084
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,029
they're cheap ticket move will drop

1085
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">precedence and this may fall in the same</font>

1086
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,740
category but there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> native any</font>

1087
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,810
operational experience and least when

1088
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:28,500
were working the dart draft the answer

1089
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:31,020
was for for the phb selections for drop

1090
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,910
precedence lack of<font color="#CCCCCC"> operation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

1091
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,890
suggested let's make sure we notice

1092
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,029
works first I that may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been from</font>

1093
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,420
multi streaming and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> having talked</font>

1094
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:42,570
off later on about multihoming but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1095
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,520
think my hair or the point was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1096
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:47,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> congestion controller ought to be</font>

1097
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible for how da CD bits are set</font>

1098
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,770
wherever there is one condition control

1099
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,330
context it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one dscp core</font>

1100
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,680
point and the reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because a</font>

1101
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,509
congestion controllers is trying to

1102
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,540
determine characteristics of the path

1103
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:03,300
and new dact code point results

1104
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:06,120
potentially in a different path

1105
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,360
and by now I thought I mean different

1106
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:12,630
properties of the but I'm uncomfortable

1107
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,700
with a congestion control of shutting

1108
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">dscp s there are other good things they</font>

1110
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,950
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think what you may want to</font>

1111
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:25,950
do is expose the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing up through</font>

the API and get the get get get the

1113

browser involved in setting that up I

1114
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,840
need some of my words and I'm going to

1115
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">take this off and if you want to go to</font>

1116
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">music on this okay fine or a bless Katie</font>

1117
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:41,580
can you please our move forward one

1118
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:45,390
slide yeah that the fact that lower

1119
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:47,700
effort is more or less random outputs

1120
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,930
right is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a property of the</font>

1121
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:56,779
service itself it's just a matter of

1122
00:47:50,930 --> 00:48:00,779
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dscp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to PHP mapping is very</font>

1123
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:03,780
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's just a recommendation</font>

1124
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:07,680
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSC in the original our CEO of</font>

1125
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:10,320
for lower effort and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess this is</font>

1126
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:14,310
an outcome of the flexibility of the

1127
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">deserve architecture that you can have</font>

1128
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:20,970
various methods from<font color="#CCCCCC"> DSC p2p HP's and</font>

1129
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:24,180
every provider can do it in their own

1130
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,930
way and I guess the maybe the

1131
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:31,770
interconnection draft of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rüdiger is</font>

1132
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:35,180
some some way of moving forward having

1133
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:40,620
common let's say recommendation for a

1134
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">DCP to PHP mappings that would be the</font>

1135
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,100
third draft here i'm actually a

1136
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:47,580
co-author on that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping we move</font>

1137
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:50,670
forward however lower effort is not one

1138
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the other traffic classes that the</font>

1139
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,420
draft is addressing and the rest of

1140

1144
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:09,270
that cs1 inversion is maybe the idea of

1145
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,870
having same mapping as in able to and

1146
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:16,310
not one<font color="#CCCCCC"> cue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1149
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,950
multipath I mean the problem with sctp

1150
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:28,270
diversity context you only have one path

1151
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:28,270
you can't do any tricks in any way so

1152
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,250
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you're thinking</font>

1153
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,529
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand your comment</font>

1154
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,180
about that you can treat different

1155
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:39,440
classes as being as different six

1156
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,390
couples and therefore treat them as

1157
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,250
different context I I can understand it

1158
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:47,060
but that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes via ctp as I</font>

1159
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:49,100
understand it but yeah if the end of the

1160
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,560
day turn punches you want pin hole

1161
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,930
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got much of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1162
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,990
lot of a quick command about this lower

1163
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,339
than best effort thing I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1164
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,740
congestion control mechanisms that are

1165
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:03,110
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in RM cut now they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all delay</font>

1166
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,700
based changing them to be lower than

1167
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:07,040
best effort will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> super simple</font>

1168
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,140
change I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's just because</font>

1169
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,540
it's hard to make them not best effort I

1170
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,740
mean not<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower than best effort so if</font>

1171
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,570
you just remove some of this extra

1172
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,430
becomes a lower than best effort scheme

1173
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:18,170
you have it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy i think if</font>

1174
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a requirement group could</font>

1175
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,820
probably do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think widespread</font>

1176
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:27,980
available it is something we can all

1177
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:30,380
look forward to injure McRae yeah i

1178
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's not doing lower than</font>

be sniffing directly via deficit the

1180
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,020
real thing that makes it a crapshoot is

1181
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,850
that there are very widely deployed

1182
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,740
systems like a large fraction of the

1183
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:42,470
world's home routers that do have that

1184
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:44,540
inversion that treats cs1 as higher than

1185
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,399
best effort priority and that's an

1186
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,380
unfortunate bug but it's so widely

1187
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,680
deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the deployed state of the</font>

00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font>

1189
00:50:55,349 --> 00:51:04,359
anybody else one more one more comment I

1190
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:07,058
mean this X relates to this magnet rest

1191
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:09,460
Linkin about WebRTC and this part

<font color="#E5E5E5">ization I mean WebRTC is not only</font>

1194
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> including scheduling</font>

1196
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,240
and that's I think worth noting so you

1197
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,649
actually get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

1198
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:30,250
congestion control and the scheduling

00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:33,510
for transmissions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's it</font>

1200
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,510
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

cool

1202
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,440
just speak about that one sure

1203
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:24,030
such a deal let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so for the rest of</font>

the discussions that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having on the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">isg but that are relevant to TSP not</font>

1209
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:43,230
some of them are if you've heard if

1210
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:49,950
you've noticed anything about changes to

1211
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:51,720
the area structure and to the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

area directors / area and things like

00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,399
that that have happened in the past six

00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">months or so there's actually been a lot</font>

1215
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,940
more going on than there has been in

1216
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:05,368
previous years we've what we're trying

1221
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:22,050
about this in some detail at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plenary</font>

1222
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:24,029
on Wednesday also so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure</font>

1223
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:27,540
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you guys a chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1224
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:29,670
thinking about that so some of the

1225
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that have already happened we've</font>

1226
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:35,880
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing where you can where we</font>

1227
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:38,910
can assign area directors to working

1228
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:44,070
groups that are not in their area that's

1229
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:48,319
that's started out being a lot of a lot

1230
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that we were doing to move</font>

1231
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:55,200

00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">Benoit so that he could focus on a lot</font>

1233
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,700
of the gang model work that's being done

1234
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,380
so if you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about that</font>

1235
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what's going on with that if you</font>

1236
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:07,859
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at the list of</font>

1237
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:10,680
working groups on the Charter page you

1238
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:13,500
will see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in operations have</font>

1239
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,509
a responsible area director that's

1240
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,890
neither one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing ops area</font>

1241
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,970
directors and that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1242
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:23,460
with

1243
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:29,609
we did a more flexible definition of

1244
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:32,650
area directors and if you saw RFC 74 75

1245
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:35,320
which basically said we were able to

1246
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have more than two area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directors in an</font>

1247
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,670
area the first the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> area that's</font>

1248
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:43,330
taken advantage of that has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font>

1249
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:45,340
if you guys will you guys will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see three</font>

1250
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:48,400
area directors<font color="#CCCCCC"> seated for the next</font>

00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:52,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming is GI Wednesday night that's</font>

1252
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,760
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with that we're doing a</font>

1253
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,560
lot of focus on denim models work with

1254
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:00,940
you know like I said we've been why and

1255
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:03,750
then with a coordinator group and if you

1256
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:07,590
guys have seen discussions which are

1257
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:10,270
this is still in process but but

1258
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:13,960
reorganizing the absent area and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rye</font>

1259
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:17,650
area into one area called art and that's

1260
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:20,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">going along with going down from 23 80s</font>

1261
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:23,440
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> four we're still the process of</font>

1262
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:27,580
creating the art area one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1263
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:31,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going on there is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are we</font>

1264
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:34,180
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alyssa Cooper is on maternity leave</font>

1265
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:36,430
right now she's one of the affected area

1266
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,470
director so what kind of waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

1267
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:43,600
to get back so we can do more with that

1268
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:46,470
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then so the thing moving out various</font>

1269
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:53,410
working groups between areas and and and

1270
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:55,390
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these did all this so the</font>

1271
00:55:53,410 --> 00:56:02,710
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted you all to be thinking</font>

1272
00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:07,420
about we were the IHG is doing a lot of

1273
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:12,130
work on trying to improve the way things

1274
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:14,710
work around here so far they very little

1275
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:16,780
of it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been transport specific so</font>

1276
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:21,330
number one that goes along with that is

1277
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,330
that the transport area

1278
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:28,779
has more tools available now than a lot

1279
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:31,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us think about because these these</font>

1280
00:56:28,779 --> 00:56:34,619
tools were put in place to<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve other</font>

1281
00:56:31,209 --> 00:56:34,618
problems what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them as well</font>

1282
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:43,749
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing I think I wanted to</font>

1283
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:46,289
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that we've still got we've stood</font>

1284
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:49,328
at work to do on the transport area

1285
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:53,309
beyond what hit where we are right now

1286
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:55,359
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big one of the big things</font>

1287
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,670
passions that I've had and we've talked

1288
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:00,670
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> various TSP area meeting since</font>

1289
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:03,579
I became an area director not quite two

1290
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:05,859
years ago is basically is basically

1291
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:08,229
saying we want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1292
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:11,319
transport area has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the management that</font>

1293
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:13,118
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area deserves and so that some of</font>

1294
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:15,308
that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be yeah so that will be making</font>

1295
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,609
sure that actually a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that will be</font>

1296
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:20,979
making sure that the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> directors that</font>

1297
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:24,489
the Syrian needs are able to serve you

1298
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:26,109
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a manageable</font>

1299
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:29,019
commitment for them and that's and it's

1300
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,788
been I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been I not transform</font>

1301
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:33,339
is not the only area that's experienced

1302
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:36,609
that but Transport has had difficulties

1303
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:41,380
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past and Martin I would</font>

1304
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:43,558
really like to change that there are

1305
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,369
things that there are things that we can

1306
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:49,900
there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can take</font>

1307
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:53,469
advantage of now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it and RFC 74 75</font>

1308
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:57,190
where we have the opportunity of using

1309
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:59,039
three area directors where we had only

1310
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:01,989
one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the possibilities</font>

1311
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,579
previously being you know one good

1312
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:04,900
example of this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said there</font>

1313
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:06,309
are others but there may be there may be

1314
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:12,969
things that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that are</font>

1315
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:14,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific to transport and I'm kind of</font>

1316
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:16,299
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be sure and</font>

1317
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:18,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">say is that we're willing to do those</font>

1318
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:22,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you know we're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

1319
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:24,579
trying to make that realistic it's been

1320
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,380
you know you could observe that it's

1321
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:28,209
easier to get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign up for a</font>

1322
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,269
second term is<font color="#E5E5E5"> area director than it is</font>

1323
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:32,950
to get them to sign up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a first term</font>

1324
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:35,200

1335
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:06,750
what you think the needs of transfer are

1336
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:13,030
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do things about or</font>

1337
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:15,730
anything so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know we can we</font>

1339
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:20,740
people have things like to chat about

1340
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:23,290
but because they recognize what a little

1341
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:26,290
have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know discussion at the wesley</font>

1345
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:44,950
more of an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do feedback</font>

1346
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:49,420
and share ideas even given that you've

1347
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some time to think about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

1348
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too much about this but i</font>

1349
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should consider in</font>

1350
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,480
terms of restructuring is that there is

1351
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:59,859
more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more work in the applications</font>

1352
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,619
area that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing transport</font>

1353
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:07,140
work like HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> to was very much a</font>

1354
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:09,640
transport protocol and it's not really

1355
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:11,259
getting reviewed in the transport area

1356
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,328
and the two seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a bit</font>

1357
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,540
disconnected so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there may be some</font>

1358
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:18,670
structural problem there I can talk

1359
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it more maybe I'll talk about more</font>

1360
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:23,500
privately and then we can frame it but

1361
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:25,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Peter I would encourage people also feel</font>

1362
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,220
free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this to the TSB</font>

1363
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:29,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">area list so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people have a chance</font>

1364
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,970
to think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before friday that's</font>

1365
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,200
what raised it just so people can think

1366
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:37,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the issue and how it might be</font>

1367
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:41,078
dealt with and maybe when one's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

1368
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:43,359
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one thing which is</font>

1369
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:45,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">being discussed in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg but also may</font>

1370
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,519
be with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to</font>

1371
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:48,219
become

1372
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">lady in the future is their first bullet</font>

1373
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:53,349
here is reducing the time commitment

1374
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:55,538
that somebody has to have to be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad</font>

1375
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,949
right now it's suddenly like 75 two

1376
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:00,069
hundred percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to get down</font>

1377
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:02,409
to fifty percent and there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> pried</font>

1378
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:04,919
quite good if you have views on that and

1379
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:08,949
maybe also ideas how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there</font>

1380
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:10,598
and what Bob mentioned is there may be

1381
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:12,749
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we should talk about the</font>

1382
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:14,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">future of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the structure of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area and</font>

1383
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:16,988
yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do this on friday</font>

1384
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:22,899

1385
01:01:16,989 --> 01:01:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys any other question question for me</font>

1386
01:01:22,899 --> 01:01:29,529
maybe where are the blue sheets if we

1387
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:34,529
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about structure so they are gone</font>

1388
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:36,999
then so where are the roof sheets please

1389
