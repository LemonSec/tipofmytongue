1
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:17,420
all right we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:22,369
started welcome to NV<font color="#E5E5E5"> 03 the second</font>

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,960
session today we have a shorter agenda

4
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,029
we've got one hour we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two</font>

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,210
presentations they are on a similar

6
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:32,000
topic which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Oh am in overlays so</font>

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:35,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully the two together can encourage</font>

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,910
a good discussion afterward if we have

9
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:40,820
extra time which our agenda has<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,010
20 minutes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have some open</font>

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,350
discussion that we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,699
on any questions around the data plane

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:51,620
adoptions so we'll have time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,690
no one has anything to say on it we can

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about other things or break up a</font>

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,949
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes early so jumping through</font>

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:04,009
real fast the intro slides first of all

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,780
as always this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an ietf meeting so</font>

19
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,660
anything you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say here is a contribution</font>

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the ITF the note well describes what</font>

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,509
that means in more detail so please be

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,130
sure to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with it we have blue</font>

23
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,619
sheets which have been started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,449
passed around it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be obviously</font>

25
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a room this size it's going to be</font>

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,080
tricky to get it everywhere so I

27
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,300
appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it people can help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each other</font>

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,580
out passing it around without too much

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,179
distraction we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get everyone's</font>

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,490
name on it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible we have John and</font>

31
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:38,030
ignis just as on Monday are taking notes

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,530
here today so thank you both and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,849
presenting these through WebEx so if you

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,520
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch them on your screen or</font>

35
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:47,750
you're listening remotely you can see

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,750
them there today like I said shorter

37
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,539
agenda one hour long we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

38
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:58,399
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Eric nordmark and then from</font>

39
00:01:53,539 --> 00:02:00,259
Diego Garcia<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oam options and</font>

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,080
so i'll take one moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

41
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:08,720
here wants to bash the agenda and

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,289
nobody's complaining so I think Eric we

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,289
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,069
well you can stand there I'm supposed to

45
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand here how it is one that we're</font>

46
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:39,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on video right Fiona Mike</font>

47
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,750
there is a second camera out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,220
particularly when you don't remember

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you wrote on the slide because you</font>

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,230
did the slides like a week ago and like

51
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:05,920
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's back there but so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

52
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:10,780
trace rod for overlays go to the next

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,549
slide so there's three pieces here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,810
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an exclusion of anything</font>

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,820
else we might be doing whether I am

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,420
right but this might actually be a

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,549
useful tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the OEM</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> toolbox so keep</font>

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,780
that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind as we think about you know</font>

59
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,910
different different forms of OM one of

60
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,970
my observations has been the traceroute

61
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,490
on the internet today tells me a bunch

62
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe I shouldn't be</font>

63
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">allowed to see but actually do you see</font>

64
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,510
them maybe for historical reasons or

65
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:46,450
maybe because it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful right</font>

66
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:48,250
and what s with you as we do you overlay

67
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,339
networks we might actually lose some of

68
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,600
this visibility by design as opposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

69
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,580
buy policy and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,320
that hard to change right we have

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,860
actually prototype stuff for vehicle<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">a dusty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so so this is sort of the</font>

73
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">typical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path that you could see this was</font>

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,310
sitting at work it looks similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

75
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,440
home I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what these routers</font>

76
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,170
are so why is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful one might ask</font>

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,570
well because I can take this stuff and

78
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,890
put it in a trouble ticket all right and

79
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can send it off to our IT department</font>

80
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,089
and they can go figure it's the problem

81
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,890
on our end or is it as they go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

82
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,710
the ISP or is it somewhere else making

83
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:30,039
forward the stuff along and if I have a

84
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,989
temporary outage you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort</font>

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can feed some useful</font>

86
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,570
information in other than saying I can't

87
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,520
get there from here right so I think

88
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,979
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this stuff and</font>

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,030
say I can send this off this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I</font>

90
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:48,130
saw at 9am this morning and someone can

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,169
figure out well was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there something</font>

92
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,539
wrong on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular router at that</font>

93
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,139
point in time as opposed to having to

94
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,409
look

95
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're right so that's the the the</font>

96
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level thing so today there isn't</font>

97
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,069
much policy to enable people to block

98
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,680
here in fin<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp wants to hide ur</font>

99
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,810
topology from this from IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace route</font>

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,939
they sort of have to either tunnel

101
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,469
things which they do with mpls and

102
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:14,139
whatever I clearly can't see everything

103
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:15,550
I can't see the whatever optical trunks

104
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,860
that are used underneath and whatever

105
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,810
right mpls there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things I</font>

106
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,999
can't see but I can see if they're a bit

107
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could see more than a binary didn't</font>

108
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:27,310
get there and they could filter things

109
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:34,620
out if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well not send any</font>

110
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:38,259
ice in peace next oh I have the clicker

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,580
so when we come to tunnels the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF if</font>

112
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,529
you go look at it we have actually

113
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,479
developed two different tunnel models

114
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:45,639
one is called the pipe model and the

115
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,800
other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a uniform model this</font>

116
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been done both for diffserv as well</font>

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,650
as for TTL and the pipe model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

118
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:56,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's commonly destroyed or most</font>

119
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,318
commonly used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for env3 that means</font>

120
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,659
that the env<font color="#E5E5E5"> II actually puts on a fixed</font>

121
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,819
TTL that's configured in the outer

122
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:10,688
header and then on eager so you just

123
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:13,330
throw that away oh that's all right oh

124
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:16,529
yeah it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter we can do</font>

125
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:20,080
them in this order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> burn ok and and</font>

126
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:22,389
with a uniform model and you basically

127
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,938
are counting the TTL across the whole

128
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:27,819
path under<font color="#E5E5E5"> layin and overlaid together</font>

129
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:31,419
and the behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is that the the</font>

130
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:33,580
ingress<font color="#CCCCCC"> nve will set the outer TTL to be</font>

131
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,710
the inner or the original TTL minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

132
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,479
and likewise sort of copying in the

133
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,000
other direction and decrementing on the

134
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,039
egress so these two behaviors are

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,289
described but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> might mostly think</font>

136
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:49,949
about the the pipe model so so some of

137
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:53,229
the issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up that are</font>

138
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,199
particular to to overlay networks and in

139
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:59,500
particular also to overlay networks

140
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:02,440
carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2 your Ethernet frames is that</font>

141
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,670
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have a</font>

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,650

there are no IP hops involved at all

149
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:26,830
right and yeah the ARP request may or

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,080
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout depends whether you are</font>

propagating ARP information in the

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,240
control plane or sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing flooding</font>

153
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,950
and whatever but in order to see

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,320
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually need some access</font>

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,940
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ingress and the e so if I can you</font>

156
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,490
know get access to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing whether</font>

157
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,070
it's a virtual switch or whether it's a

158
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,340
physical switch I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need to</font>

159
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,170
do several things one is check whether

160
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,510
the underlay has an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue by doing a</font>

161
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,390
ping or trace route but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also have to</font>

162
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,210
go check some set of tables that map my

163
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,820
overlay traffic to the underlay and

164
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,620
describe how their scent right whether

165
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,260
it's mappings from from vlans to the NI

166
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,680
IDs whether it's some sort of flooding

167
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,980
tables or whatever MAC address to remote

168
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,480
IP address of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nve right I need to go</font>

169
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,590
inspect all of those things and then I

170
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,240
can tell it's this thing actually well

171
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,770
that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be sufficient because I'm</font>

172
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,740
not likely certain that the packet even

173
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,840
reaches that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nve and that's very hard to</font>

174
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,330
tell because it's effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> in l2</font>

175
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,179
service and you know you can't really

176
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,689
there's no widely available tools to

177
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:40,569
tell that from a host so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have</font>

178
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,160
that that access to their me the only

179
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,590
trouble ticket I can generate you saying

180
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,610
it didn't work right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's the IP</font>

181
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:52,900
address i<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to get there so we have</font>

182
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">those two models so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess it</font>

183
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,410
doesn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so basically this means</font>

184
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,890
that i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disability</font>

185
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:03,339
underlay if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use the uniform</font>

186
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,410
tunnel model because now i seen p errors

187
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,600
TTL exceeded<font color="#E5E5E5"> that treasure our users</font>

188
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,550
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent from everyone along the</font>

189
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,460
path everybody will uniform the

190
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,099
decrement ppl the ingress and egress and

191
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,110
me included but

192
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:21,040
not sufficient there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more piece we</font>

193
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,960
need it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we handle i simpiy</font>

194
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,439
errors and this is an area<font color="#CCCCCC"> we played in</font>

195
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,080
before not for the TTL exceeded but for

196
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,850
other things so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that so</font>

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,580
these desizing p errors sent by the

198
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,190
underlay routers will be sent back to

199
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,070
the source of that IP packet all right

200
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,860
standard ICMP or IP forwarding behavior

201
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,650
and that's the ingress<font color="#CCCCCC"> mV so the ingress</font>

202
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,900
mb gets these IP packets are sorry gets

203
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:50,020
these i simpiy errors and it can go look

204
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside and say oh this is a DX lon</font>

205
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,420
whatever envio 3m cap packet that was in

206
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,690
error I can go extract where needed

207
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,579
actually come from and send it back

208
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:06,580
basically deliver an ICP error that

209
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:08,860
makes sense for the original host so if

210
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,400
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at an example of how</font>

211
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,810
this would behave is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there's</font>

212
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,579
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> special piece here which we haven't</font>

213
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">done before which has to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with mac</font>

214
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,530
addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike headers but first one</font>

215
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,590
the host censored and packed with the

216
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,600
TTL<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two it gets encapsulated and as</font>

217
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,270
part of that the TTL gets decremented to

218
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,820
one and then it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the first</font>

219
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,449
underlay router the decrement and checks

220
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,940
TTL and says this expired right and it

221
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,930
sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three here is</font>

222
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,750
the shape of that I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the error it has</font>

223
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,420
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> envio three whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VX town header</font>

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,780
in there and whatever it had inside

225
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,760
which is a mac<font color="#CCCCCC"> and IP header and then</font>

226
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">when that packet comes back to the</font>

227
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,800
ingress MBE it can form the icing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierre</font>

228
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,490
at the bottom that makes sense for the

229
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,530
original host and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i put</font>

230
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,130
examples of what this stuff looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

231
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:09,100
some example so that's that's all there

232
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,660
is to it right well there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

233
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:16,480
which is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want this</font>

234
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,969
uniform TTL for all packets so the host

235
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,190
here says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the same subnet as this</font>

236
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,650
destination host there could be some

237
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,200
protocols that assume something about

238
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,060
TTL like TTL doesn't occur man if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send</font>

239
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,840
it with TTL one and gets there because

240
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,209
we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

241
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,000
map that would break if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you applied this</font>

242
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,220
uniform model all the time there could

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,070
be other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that use TTL 255 and check</font>

244
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,400
out the receiver same thing right so you

245
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,170
have to do some ingress selection or you

246
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,030
have to do some selection<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ingress to</font>

247
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,339
figure out am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I going to use the pipe</font>

248
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,980
model or the uniform model for this and

249
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:54,070
you could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any way you please</font>

250
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,450
write it could be based on and here's

251
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,010
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you the policy norm</font>

252
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,530
comes in saying should I do this for

253
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,700
this customer is it for this port this

254
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:06,569
particular originating IP mac address

255
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,730
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicated trace</font>

256
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,460
infrastructure that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> run in the overlay</font>

257
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,520
for this right you can do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

258
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,340
want something if you want to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

259
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:22,780
granularity where a host can do it that

260
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,730
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also running running other traffic</font>

261
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,459
you want something in the packet to

262
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,410
select this and there's two things that

263
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,330
you can easily tweak in the packet and

264
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,290
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can set in the linux trace</font>

265
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,760
route one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dscp or toss</font>

266
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,040
white and the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the UDP</font>

267
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,810
source port that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use so you can</font>

268
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,020
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up some things on the</font>

269
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:46,239
ingress and be saying okay this customer

270
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,760
is authorized to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right I will</font>

271
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,700
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer can if</font>

272
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it uses this DCP value or whatever or</font>

273
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,280
the CDP source port<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give</font>

274
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:02,709
those packets the uniform TTL processing

275
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,030
model and there's some difference is

276
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,600
that some trade-offs in graph between

277
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,770
that in terms of entropy and whatever I

278
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,390
think I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slight love so I</font>

279
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:14,230
think I'll go through that one before

280
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:17,020
questions but and the the second piece

281
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,060
is if I want the behavior on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

282
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,699
egress I have to have some way I'm

283
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:26,040
instructing the egress on a per packet

284
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:28,690
basis what TTL behavior do you want and

285
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,010
the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of doing this stuff we</font>

286
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,410
played around with different ones but

287
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:36,520
this is one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually getting one bit</font>

288
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:41,160
in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> B header that says please</font>

289
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:45,040
apply uniform TTL behavior at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

290
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,839
and note that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's been discussions</font>

291
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,599
about sort of OEM bits with slightly

292
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,790
different semantics just a fly that it's

293
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,429
not the same right the OEM bit that's

294
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,990
been discussed is this is an oem frame

295
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:58,420
that should not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivered to the</font>

296
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,449
unhold that's not the behavior we want

297
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:06,399
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want the this TTL behavior</font>

298
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:07,809
oh yeah there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do this</font>

299
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,129
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> i simpiy errors you can do it</font>

300
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,420
with our agenda packet too big for

301
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,240
instance you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

302
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,949
way of detecting that I think my

303
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,629
underlay should be configured to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

304
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,939
to carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> the encapsulated packets but</font>

305
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:21,309
maybe it's misconfigured we've seen

306
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:24,248
customers actually do this right and and

307
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:26,319
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out well if not that</font>

308
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:29,709
hard you send a small ping packet things

309
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:31,660
work they run<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and it doesn't tcp</font>

310
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:33,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">times up because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP sounds full-size</font>

311
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,199
back at well now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

312
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:39,249
okay what should i look for right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

313
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,579
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know other sort of unreachable</font>

314
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:44,920
whatever so in via con me prototype<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

315
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:46,599
stuff we found a bit at least at the

316
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,769
time wasn't being used for something

317
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,990
else then of its that's still the case

318
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:56,019
with all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VX lon proposals but and</font>

319
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,240
and it basically says here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

320
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:02,139
capsule aiding behavior that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

321
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,059
bit the semantics of that bit and there

322
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,009
are some things that might surprise

323
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:07,929
people when you do this so the first one

324
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,939
is your underlay and overlay are

325
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:13,420
actually diff different addressing

326
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:15,219
realms right and you could think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

327
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,709
as separate verbs or whatever but like

328
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,040
you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has net 10 right</font>

329
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,739
well you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run n bo3 or VX</font>

330
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,389
down whatever where the underlay use is

331
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">not 10 as well it's perfectly valid</font>

332
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:30,399
because it's l2 or l3 they don't meet

333
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,679
anywhere well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do this and</font>

334
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the example but when you do</font>

335
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:38,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the trace our output is going to</font>

336
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,230
show the underlay and overlay IP

337
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,839
addresses so you better<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that when</font>

338
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,699
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable this thing don't think that</font>

339
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,009
you can ping those those underlay

340
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:49,569
addresses is any useful way right but

341
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,100
there might even be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same addresses</font>

342
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:53,050
that you're using your overlay inverse K

343
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,750
right so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you know that okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

344
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,030
can do it over later a<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop which sees</font>

345
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,650
whatever overlay part of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> path I can</font>

346
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:02,470
do this combined trade route that sees

347
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:04,060
both and if I take both of them and put

348
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,400
them in the trouble ticket someone can

349
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,829
actually figure out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on the</font>

350
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,380
other surprises what you see as you have

351
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:15,810
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP versions this notion I'm</font>

352
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,990
getting and underlay ICMP error and

353
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:22,060
generating an overlay I CPR means taking

354
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,630
IP addresses that are in the underlay

355
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:29,800
and showing them overlay well that works

356
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:32,439
well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's v4 486 / before because I</font>

357
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,050
can fit 32 bits in 128 which is what

358
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,080
this example shows that basically these

359
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,550
six ICMP errors that have 96 bits of

360
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,950
leading zeros or whatever it's something

361
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really matter what it is it's</font>

362
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just something that provides useful</font>

363
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,180
information for the guy who's gonna look

364
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:54,130
at the trouble ticket and I think that's

365
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:57,010
it hey well I guess the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

366
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a useful tool right</font>

367
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,610
and and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something that</font>

368
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">people should consider but as they look</font>

369
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:08,520
at different encapsulations so questions

370
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,270
or comments David black um I mean we lay

371
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,020
something that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> was said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

372
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:16,329
rather strongly at the sputters food

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,740
bought this morning dscp is not a

375
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,970
this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually think that your</font>

376
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:27,730
most common case you actually don't need

377
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything in the protocol which is that</font>

378
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,880
if you're using a virtual switch that's

379
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,600
co-located on the same box with your

380
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,600
traffic source that can be set up by

381
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,090
that can be set up but set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up via via</font>

382
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,209
other means there there there some

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,649
interesting possibilities on

384
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,320

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cases right but also you do need if</font>

387
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do this at the granularity</font>

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,070
basically dedicate one of those in the

391
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sort of have to request people</font>

putting something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in market in the</font>

requesting that your complexity I think

398
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,799
I think keep looking because said this

this is not a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> use dscp your</font>

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,659
or five 776 bytes to play with but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

429
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,908
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry share on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the line</font>

430
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:51,429
I think what you're doing is a nice hack

431
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:53,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really architecture it wrong because</font>

432
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're violating all the layers</font>

433
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:58,659
you just be thought a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> later to</font>

434
00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:02,229
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to uniform on my model</font>

435
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:04,179
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is absolutely wrong well there's a</font>

436
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:07,539
rag no but there is a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

437
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:09,190
what is the purpose of layers right and

438
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,559
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them is providing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some superb</font>

439
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure that underneath that doesn't</font>

440
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,849
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the abstraction should get in</font>

441
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:19,299
the way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability this is a one hop</font>

442
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:21,189
and early whatever you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

443
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,840
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> overlay it's a one hop over late</font>

444
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,690
whatever you want to do is one hung over

445
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,519
but this applies even when I have a

446
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,710
combination of overlay and underlay hot

447
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,929
saree the same thing I'm being able to

448
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,239
say these packets are marked with arcing

449
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,460
a disability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the underlay if you had</font>

450
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:38,649
terminated the little<font color="#CCCCCC"> match the layer 2</font>

451
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,729
and I've done an IT inside the excellent

452
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:46,719
of that I agree but this is wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

453
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:48,519
Sean opinion really yeah i was going to

454
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,460
actually say something similar to him

455
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,039
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go to slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 right do I</font>

456
00:20:51,460 --> 00:21:01,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">have slide number Pedro this is an old</font>

457
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:04,658
gun one from them so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the</font>

458
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">nbe encapsulating the packet of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TTL</font>

459
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,109
decrement so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true</font>

460
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:11,019
right because the enemy if it's a layer

461
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 and EE it doesn't decrement the TTL at</font>

462
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:16,779
all correct that's one of the behaviors

463
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:19,539
in terms of providing this despite this

464
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:21,940
this uniform ppl model write that as n

465
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:24,690
cap and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> countless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hops there as</font>

466
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,960
well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to the underlay all</font>

467
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:31,330
right be good and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I picked</font>

468
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,989
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is that it seems useful to</font>

469
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,269
showing all parts of the path so if it

470
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:39,940
won't work if it's a non IP packet if

471
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:42,279
you're transporting well how would you

472
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,749
mark the non IP packets right that

473
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,389
clearly you can't find an IP header

474
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:48,849
there to go do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with so you'll</font>

475
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:51,728
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need you have to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the pipe</font>

476
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:54,369
model for non IP packets but last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I</font>

477
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:55,809
checked ninety-nine point nine percent

478
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:58,559
of the packets that we carry here r.i.p

479
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:02,850
but but but it doesn't break those right

480
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:06,720
the key thing that still works still

481
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,370
works yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that this is different</font>

482
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,159
because people are used to thinking in

483
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,559
layers and that's useful for some things

484
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,019
all right but that doesn't mean if you

485
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,570
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it significantly harder to see</font>

486
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:21,059
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and and as a result</font>

487
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,149
making it operationally difficult to

488
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:26,428
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these networks I think you</font>

489
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:29,668
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should pause write and think is</font>

490
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:33,149
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what we want right every</font>

491
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:35,129
night yeah the general thinking tends to

492
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:36,809
be that you let the lower layers take

493
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:41,039
care of<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves and then you have</font>

494
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:43,559
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can query each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lee yes very</font>

495
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,610
and I can see cases running<font color="#CCCCCC"> jwhite the</font>

496
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">comp in sa correlations assuming the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

497
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,258
it is somewhat hard I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

498
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:54,658
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even if I</font>

499
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,940
take in some of the failures I've seen

500
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,740
right even if I was running BFD doing

501
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,869
continuous monitoring of my underlie

502
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,450
path making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that one didn't</font>

503
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">fail I still have configuration issues</font>

504
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:11,820
when this stuff fails because the

505
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:14,939
mapping from l2 into the tunnel right is

506
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,740
somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> misconfigured</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work whether it's</font>

507
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,590
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the port come of eel on</font>

508
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,990
TV and I or some the flood list or

509
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,869
whatever I used to do right that stuff

510
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:28,710
is misconfigured and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the</font>

511
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:31,740
underlay OEM doesn't help I really need

512
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to connect the button and the overlay</font>

513

<font color="#E5E5E5">one by itself doesn't tell me anything</font>

514
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,259
either and failed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have a</font>

515
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:40,590
good way of connecting the dots<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

516
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:44,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so if if you had your end hosts</font>

517
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:47,970
sending out some kind of messages that

518
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:49,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data they would go</font>

519
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,809
through the same data part and they

520
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,360
would discover where the problem is

521
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,580
right there would just be dropped on the

522
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,379
force on all right it'll get dropped

523
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,658
somewhere and because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not received</font>

524
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:02,668
you will know I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

525
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,799
disappeared somewhere else I could tell

526
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:08,500
that it's not working but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't tell</font>

527
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,580
where it's not working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

528
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,570
I mean what you mentioned was that

529
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,840
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the place where the</font>

530
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:20,470
mapping takes place from l to r us to

531
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,870
l-3 and that mapping takes place at the

532
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:26,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">english point and egress right but he</font>

533
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">grace and so you would know but but as</font>

534
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:32,110
she start complex more complex

535
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,530
topologies right you might end up with

536
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,840
multiple sort of chained<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bo three</font>

537
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,460
tunnels ain't going through some routers

538
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,040
that route between them whatever and

539
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,610
then it actually gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well yes</font>

540
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,530
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give some idea about at</font>

541
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,449
in the overlay did it get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this router</font>

542
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,100
that you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did get over the first</font>

543
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,440
tunnel right I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

544
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,629
overlake high throw but I then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

545
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,930
so now I know which tunnel forgot debug

546
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,060
any on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a quick note we this</font>

547
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,920
conversation we move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our question</font>

548
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the limit it to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

549
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,490
currently standing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that the next</font>

550
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaker isn't as well yeah so just</font>

551
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:15,100
follow the steam come quick yeah if so

552
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,870
that the only so my biggest concern with

553
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,480
this would be the scalability issues

554
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:24,040
because let's say you have a medium dm's

555
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,780
using the underlay each of those million

556
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMS tries to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things like</font>

557
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,460
trace route that underly needs to

558
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,050
respond to and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

559
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,180
control something like that how do I

560
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,830
control the festivities today in an IP

561
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,460
network I don't know some you turn it

562
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:42,570
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> i Baca lies in peace now bark all</font>

563
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,570
treasure I

564
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:48,999
I can do it from home today I can do it

565
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,850
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I can do it from work icmp I</font>

566
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:53,889
mean Tracy artworks in IP and the

567
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,330
routers don't fall over in the internet

568
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:56,918
and there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people that I'm</font>

569
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,230
sure I dossing it right now as well

570
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,549
right so i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's any</font>

571
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:05,559
worse but that's hi Tom Herbert so on

572
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier slides you mentioned</font>

573
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:11,408
these two models the pipe model versus

574
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:12,970
the uniform GTL model yep so my question

575
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">is should we actually consider the</font>

576
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:19,029
uniform tunnel model as kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

577
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,070
operational model and the example<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

578
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:24,360
give i think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> david's example if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

579
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:28,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 n bees are co-located with a host</font>

580
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,019
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VMS TTL was relevant in that</font>

581
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:34,299
case if they set a TTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one that's one</font>

582
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:38,619
single tunnel so therefore the packets

583
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:41,470
will go however if my bm's<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce a</font>

584
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:43,209
routing loop in the overlay then

585
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,450
theoretically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can go through n squared</font>

586
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:49,570
hops in the underlay just to just have

587
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">one packet eventually run out of TTL so</font>

588
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:55,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm wondering if this is like a problem</font>

589
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:56,950
that you might want to address here but

590
00:26:55,149 --> 00:27:00,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't think we can change it because</font>

591
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:02,860
there are protocols like ipv6 neighbor

592
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:05,049
discovery right that you know that run

593
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,658
between hosts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the same</font>

594
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:10,360
subnet and they assume something about

595
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:13,720
tikyo and the fact that we are building

596
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,508
basically remote bridges using is this

597
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,600
overlay technology that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for those</font>

598
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:22,419
packets to still work it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

599
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">default to being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apart model that's it</font>

600
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">so for a layer to network that might be</font>

601
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:30,490
true but for layer 3 we're referring

602
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,649
customer just a default route the TTL

603
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,690
could actually correspond to the

604
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:37,779
underlay yes if you're not if you're not

605
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,200
if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying l2 service over</font>

606
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:43,779
the env3<font color="#E5E5E5"> network yes that's correct so</font>

607
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,780
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying maybe this is is that</font>

608
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,370
number 13 in the

609
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey yeah i think that that's a good</font>

610
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,330
discussion to have right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which</font>

611
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,840
is separable from the how does this

612
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,370
behave for for l2 right sorry shower on

613
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again so i want to give you</font>

614
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:03,610
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative solution which is</font>

615
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,220
architectural you're correct so you can

616
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:08,379
do for example a internet link trace

617
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:12,220
route or<font color="#E5E5E5"> linked race and then that can</font>

618
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,170
trigger a idea trace route at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NB and</font>

619
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:18,150
then you can breathe reply the results

620
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:20,200
that's our<font color="#CCCCCC"> cadet very correct e well</font>

621
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,020
that's a different way of doing things

622
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,290
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool that people are used to</font>

623
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,879
today and then again learning yes and

624
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,409
you want you want to twist the

625
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,110
architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and destroy all</font>

626
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,390
architecture soundness so that people

627
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,800
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know what is the purpose of art</font>

628
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,870
where we should take this to the bar but

629
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,570
the purpose of architecture is not

630
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,610
something that it's a way of organizing

631
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,889
our thoughts and having ways of creating

632
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,320
obstructions it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to forbid</font>

633
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,690
thing people from from solving is

634
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,439
architectes avail for reading people to

635
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,600
do things insane things it is a way of

636
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,550
keeping everything sound and you know

637
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,730
working in all different conditions and

638
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,710
situations so we should we should

639
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,330
continue this conversation but not right

640
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,910
now there is one more question in the

641
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,470
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we missed you as sort</font>

642
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:11,230
of a punishment for sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back</font>

643
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:15,820
of the room since the mic on the mics

644
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,980
was not on our visa in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous</font>

645
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,679
session equipment what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so i</font>

646
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,420
wanted to add a couple more surprises we

647
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,550
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Darrell Italy we've had a yeah</font>

648
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Darrell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluett sorry we had a lot of</font>

649
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,780
experience with deployments with trace

650
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,460
rot in hell three overlays and a couple

651
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,260
of the gotchas that we found in the in

652
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,050
the operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet ours are often</font>

653
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,840
times we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get much less than 500 bytes of</font>

654
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,090
data back like so in the cross AF tray

655
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,270
tea time expired coming back to the end

656
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,639
we get not enough are you still seeing

657
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,129
the only eight bytes of the of the

658
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">transfer coming a lot of errors because</font>

659
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,039
we fixed that was added to Rada

660
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,049
requirements in 1995 I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

661
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:58,629
this sometimes we did that because

662
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,889
apparently all right but I'm not

663
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,559
pointing fingers because it's almost

664
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,240
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor as a few you know as a as a</font>

665
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,549
device out there that does that what we

666
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,260
found impaired interesting is that when

667
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:09,820
we do cross i have often times we don't

668
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the enough information back to</font>

669
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,370
determine the actual you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know IP address</font>

670
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to pass back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bus</font>

671
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,639
back to the host<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's that's</font>

672
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,770
an additional supply it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good i</font>

673
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,409
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that that had gone away</font>

674
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,730
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the second surprise well I</font>

675
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:26,679
mean you know that windows and stuff

676
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,049
doesn't use UDP for this and it's a real

677
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,520
struggle when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracer line itself</font>

678
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,740
doesn't understand the cross they have

679
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">information you're passing back so a lot</font>

680
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,490
of times you get stars and stars<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

681
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">stars we really wish you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could get</font>

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">better information back to your to your</font>

683
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,750
users and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the other thing</font>

684
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,940
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a lot of comments</font>

685
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,350
about about performance and stuff in

686
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,000
here we've shown and implementations

687
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,010
that are doing this that do a small cash

688
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,320
just for trace route on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

689
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,600
encapsulator d caps later that handles

690
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,520
this functions and if it it's just a

691
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,779
small buffer and if it overflows because

692
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,220
too many people are doing it then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

693
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:01,870
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more stars than they would</font>

694
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,970
have gotten otherwise but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hasn't</font>

695
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,199
impacted the env performance on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on</font>

696
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,500
the control plane are you saying that

697
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,809
they remember that trace<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cuts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

698
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,309
data you have to identify the traceroute

699
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,590
that's coming from the host right and

700
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you get packets back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font>

00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">ve where to send that where to send the</font>

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,049
the traceroute back and sell three<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

703

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about no not when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

the whole payload right yes if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are getting eight eight bytes back sure</font>

706
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,629
all right exactly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

707
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:29,918
a way to have this but what I'm assuring

708
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,049
you is the hacks can be done without

709
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,480
compromising the performance of the than

710
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:41,470
B and the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> the final thing that</font>

711
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:45,330
I'll mention is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip doesn't</font>

712
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so thank you</font>

713
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:56,990
make sure

714
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">diego you can use this to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi so well</font>

715
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,780
what we're presenting is a bit

716
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,139
complementary to what derek has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

717
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:10,870
doing it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> oam from the MV e to the MV</font>

718
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:13,430
and to do a bit of data but yeah so

719
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,139
basically the idea is to to have the

720
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:18,830
capability of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> traceroute and doe</font>

721
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">am from MV 12v and some of the things</font>

722
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover with the generic</font>

723
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,169
overlay was having you know yeah the

724
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,150
first point what<font color="#E5E5E5"> eric mentioned that in</font>

725
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,250
the existing ping and traceroute does

726
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,670
not work very well for overlays for the

727
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:36,620
reasons explained before and but some of

728
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,870
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to verify is yes how</font>

729
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,750
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find information from the underlay</font>

730
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:44,030
how to find information<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the path</font>

731
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packets are taking how do i</font>

732
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,620
verify the behavior of the network when

733
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,709
there's ecmp and multiple paths of the

734
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,199
cmp in the way and how do I deal with

735
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consistency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the control and data</font>

737
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,040
when we're talking about an env that

738
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,470
might be in a co-located with the server

739
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,510
in the hypervisor but the controller

740
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,610
might be an open flow controller or some

741
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,950
external controller you have to have

742
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,189
some way of ensuring that that data path

743
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:16,070
that you believe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one thing has</font>

744
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:19,100
it been reflected down to two to the

745
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,950
forwarding plane have some way of doing

746
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:26,060
continuity checks for verification some

747
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,250
fault isolation as well and performance

748
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:32,810
in terms of delay and packet loss

749
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:34,670
measurements so in terms of the

750
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:38,510
requirements for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overlay framework</font>

751
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:40,580

752
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:44,330
overlay endpoint should be able to send

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:46,189
them some form of frame that is follows

754
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,740
the same data path and reaches the

what's annoying packet and what's not so

768
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:25,820
that it can parse it appropriately and

769
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:30,739
reply back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the originator so we have</font>

770

some information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the idea is</font>

771
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:35,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we are able to achieve OEM for both</font>

applications in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the layer 2 and layer 3</font>

773

overlays we're seeing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the MV 0 3 is</font>

774
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:42,230
moving to supporting not just layer 2

775
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:44,869
but towards also virtual distributed

776
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,359
virtual routing environment so you know

777
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:52,369
trying to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> a the OEM in a way that</font>

778
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:54,529
supports both mechanisms and and again

779
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:56,599
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other part is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that we could</font>

780
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,540
have some capability for doing trace

781
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,190
paths maybe not necessarily from the

782
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,869
client endpoint and in fact we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

783
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:06,920
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it from the client endpoint</font>

784
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:10,099
but rather from a central management

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,730
there's one dead link in a nice EMP

790
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:24,200
bundle or in an EMP fabric how do I find

791
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,520
that particularly that is being

792
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:31,339
troublesome and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,770
forward packets based on purely on you

00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,839
can try from an MV e to another MV using

795
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,490
ping or some direct under late test but

796
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,470
you're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fully verifying that</font>

797
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,729
your VX lat encapsulated packets are

798
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:44,509
making it through that indeed the

799
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint is properly configured and and</font>

800
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,770
part of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing also with this</font>

801
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,140
framework is the ideas that to support

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:54,020
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlake technology so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

804
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,190
GRE mpls over UDP and some of the

upcoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and capsule ations are being</font>

806
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,619
proposed as well so I mean try to be

807
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:06,078
generic so that we can I mean not not be

808
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,540
the universal panacea but have having

809
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,099
some way of having something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

810
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,930
covering the different use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that MV</font>

00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,230
0 3 is

812
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,240
looking at so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the packet</font>

813
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,150
that we were proposing is I mean having

814
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is very similar or similar to what</font>

815
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:26,319
was being done and in some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> m LSP</font>

816
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,550
trade routes and LSP om that was

817
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,619
previously specified in mpls and we we

818
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,450
were looking compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

819
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,339
presented some time ago in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a previous</font>

821
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:41,380

822
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,829
header to the packet itself so we could

823
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:47,920
support multiple evolving formats for

824
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:50,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet and you'll notice that there</font>

825
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,680
are timestamps and sequence numbers very

826
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,809
early on in the packet and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as</font>

much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible have the capability of</font>

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,160
platforms that will eventually support

830
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,230
it we tried not to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamps stl</font>

831
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,899
these randomly in the packet but rather

832
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,430
in a fixed position so that if a

833
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,160
hardware implementation could

834
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:14,890
potentially timestamp it directly and

835
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,430
not have to look at it and punted to to

836
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:21,040
a control plane to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a supervisor so and</font>

837
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,049
then what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are is the sum tlv formats</font>

838
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,980
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of encapsulation that we're</font>

trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what's going on</font>

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,629
of the overlay ping in terms of how do

853
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:05,500
we originate and detect this so in

854
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:08,230
packet the idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have use some</font>

859
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,079
implementation based on that but you

860
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:23,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's been on the excellent GBE</font>

861
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,020
there's its own OEM bit being defined we

862
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,780
could

863
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,550
coexist with that bit and just use it

864
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,120
you know look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interpretation of</font>

things clean in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that encapsulation and</font>

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:45,109
in the inner Heather encapsulation here

870
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,840
is where it gets a bit trickier or a bit

871
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,180
different for everything that's tunneled

872
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:54,590
to tunnel verification<font color="#E5E5E5"> Soviet up to</font>

00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a full V explain</font>

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,910
compatible frame so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be at</font>

876
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:04,610
least an ethernet header and we were

877
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at doing actually an IP plus UDP</font>

878
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:11,930
headers as well but the echo request and

879
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,760
should have a destination MAC address

880
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:17,870
that's like a well-known neck address

881
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,970
that we can trap and we can prevent in

882
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,830
case this OEM packet arrives to an MV

883
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:25,279
that doesn't know how to interpret<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

884
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:27,200
router alert bit then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want that</font>

885
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,960
packet to be forwarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the end host</font>

886
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,430
so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have it we don't</font>

887
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,720
want to cause that packet to be flooded

888
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,600
or so on so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to use one of</font>

889
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,009
the slow protocols MAC addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

890
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,509
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually trap it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

891
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing with the IP address if there's any</font>

892
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,490
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this packet would be routed</font>

893
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,590
you know we're using at 127 00<font color="#E5E5E5"> sedo or</font>

894
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,600
you know a local host address so we

895
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:49,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet accidentally to</font>

896
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,029
anyone and this would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

897
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,770
properly identify the packet as the

898
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:58,130
destined to that to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> v-dub itself so</font>

899
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,990
we can get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of how trap it and</font>

900
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:04,850
send packet send a response back to the

901
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:06,500
host and and in terms of a layer three

902
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,779
overlay the encapsulation would be

903
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,790
similar except we wouldn't be adding

904
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,430
that additional inner ethernet header

905
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:24,160
with a mac address reserved from iono

906
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:26,480
and so yeah in terms of again the the

907
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet information we had a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

908
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">cope you know call side dress is</font>

909
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,868
specifying the router alert bit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> NV</font>

910
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:37,130
GRE<font color="#CCCCCC"> and VX lamb and</font>

911
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:40,340
we had the mac address as being

912
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:42,320
requested and we have the validate the

913
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,910
control plane and data plane the echo

914
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,130
reply with the return code so this is

915
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:49,129
the encapsulation for the reply the same

916
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:51,650
idea again a similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> mecha dress similar</font>

917
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,869
destination IP address and so on and we

918
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,090
would have different return codes in the

919
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,440
packet so that we can able to look at

920
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,970
what the different possibilities of

921
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,859
errors the different error types

922
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:05,450
different error codes were so the type

923
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,130
of request that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at in the</font>

924
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,350
moment it's basically an echo request

925
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,119
and an echo reply the echo request could

926
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">also be used to do to perform a trace</font>

927
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,710
route as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll see how that</font>

928
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:17,990
worked and the reply mode there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

929
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,350
a no reply so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify the type of</font>

930
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:23,629
reply that we want and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could specify</font>

931
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:25,910
do not reply mode so meaning we're just

932
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending probes that somehow the receiver</font>

933
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,080
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep statistics will measure like</font>

934
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,140
they have a sequence number so you can

935
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,270
measure gaps in the sequence number to

936
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,180
determine random packet loss or estimate

937
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:41,509
packet loss and or you could do a reply

938
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">via a routed ipv4 packet or ipv6 packet</font>

939
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,380
back so not encapsulated into VX lan

940
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,419
just routed back to original to the

941
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,420
originator or you could reply by the

942
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,980
overlay segment in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> return path</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

943
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the return tunnel if they</font>

944
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">return tunnel is available so sometimes</font>

945
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,640
this is having the possibility of having

946
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,950
to reply mode gives you the chance that

947
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,930
maybe your outgoing tunnel is working

948
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,970
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they repeat the response tunnel is</font>

949
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:08,270
failing so you can send the response to

950
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,919
come back through and through a routed

951
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,220
infrastructure and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunneled so you</font>

952
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,180
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm seeing that my</font>

953
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,709
unidirectional path is working with my

954
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,899
return path it's the one that's failing

955
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,700
so having that possibility opens up some

956
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,690
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait it slightly more</font>

957
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,100
interesting troubleshooting options and

958
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">then yeah we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of return</font>

959
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,470
calls as well and for the path traced

960
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:34,130
procedure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is to be able</font>

961
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:36,259
to send the echo request with outer TTL

962
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:39,560
again this is originated from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vita</font>

963
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">or the VN ve so we have the rec control</font>

964
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,970
over the TTL we're not doing layer

965
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,089
crossing there but we would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting</font>

966
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,240
the outer TTL to a particular value<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

967
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,940
we're able to send

968
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,669
I get back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for every</font>

969
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,740
increment we could also randomly or

970
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,750
sequentially increment the source UDP

971
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,140
port so that you can exercise a certain

972
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:03,000
number of hash hash is for your ecmp

973
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,680
fabric I don't guarantee that we're

974
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discover every possibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CMP</font>

975
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,779
path but if the user could request that

976
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,279
for every TTL increment I send 16

977
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,350
different UDP values and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

978
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,970
increment once i send 16 more values and

979
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:17,580
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a good idea of</font>

980
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:19,830
sweeping the underlay and and the

981
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:22,799
response for the TTL expires there would

982
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,690
be again dependent on part of the ICMP

983
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,630
response it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the the</font>

00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">point mentioned before that yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

985
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,620
are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some implementations out</font>

986
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,660
there still replying with only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 bits so</font>

987
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">8 bytes so we have to see you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

988
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,089
much information can we confirm<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 bytes</font>

989
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,620
if the 512 bytes or 500 and so bites

990
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,750
were available that's you know it's easy

991
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,190
to determine the whole thing but with

992
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,520
only eight bytes we'll have to see how

993
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,260
we can do that but there's short of also

994
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,470
requiring the intermediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> transient</font>

995
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,970
transit notes to implement a some

996
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,390
version of this OEM which potentially

997
00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:00,390
they could do in later steps the relying

998
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:05,810
on the ICMP time exceeded message it's

999
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:09,390
whatever we can have today and and

1000
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:11,880
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a the other part</font>

1001
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:14,310
is no not just verifying the tunnels but

1002
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,870
verifying the end systems and what we

1003
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:20,250
specified there were a couple of

1004
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:23,009
different TLDs where we request to ping

1005
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,230
or to verify the forwarding tables for a

1006
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,300
particular MAC address IP address Mac IP

1007
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,630
combination or just a row packet that we

1008
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,340
specify as a certain number of bytes so

1009
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:35,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that case the idea is that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1010
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,670
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up against the layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1011
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:41,550
tables or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing tables of the end</font>

1012
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,990
and ve and we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a response</font>

1013
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,640
of whether that mac address exists at

1014
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:50,939
all in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end ve that we send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1015
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:52,230
request to and and again we have a

1016
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,970
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of requests but yeah basically</font>

1017
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next steps are you know looking</font>

1018
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,930
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comments and feedbacks we</font>

1019
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,790
already got some comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing</font>

1020
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,350

1021
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,150
so we're looking at working at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1022
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:06,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">share on the value brother this is</font>

1023
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:09,610
another architecture a wrong proposal

1024
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,470
I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you why why do you even need</font>

1025
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that OEM power relay overlays an</font>

1026
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,830
adaptation layer you are not going to

1027
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,420
forward based on overlay just put an

1028
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,100
overlay the excellent header ten-forward

1029
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,460
this packet you cannot it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they</font>

1030
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:23,650
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want an oem for eater type this is</font>

1031
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:26,500
a tap tation layer react the excellent

1032
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,510
at encapsulates your your l2 header into

1033
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:33,130
an IP packet that's it why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1034
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:35,260
an oem for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overlay I mean there's</font>

1035
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,900
some pretty much it what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1036
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,520
detect in the overlay in the VX lab what

1037
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,170
do what error do you want to detect in

1038
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,300
the VX line is the tunnel working at all

1039
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:48,970
or yeah what tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not VX nine</font>

1040
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:52,180
is not the tunnel the tunnel is IP I'm

1041
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I follow I mean you cannot</font>

1042
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,970
forward the packet based on the

1043
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:59,529
excellent hitter so so so when I was

1044
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:01,959
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there and and you said that</font>

1045
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,640
this is wrong like I guess I didn't

1046
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,710
quite understand what this was but as

1047
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,150
far as I can tell what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're arguing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1048
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:13,510
that everything that has to do with the

1049
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,460
uniform<font color="#E5E5E5"> model is wrong yes because the</font>

1050
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:18,280
uniform models has something about TTL

1051
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,770
behavior and you're arguing as far as i

1052
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,170
can tell that that is architectural<font color="#CCCCCC"> e</font>

1053
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:25,780
incorrect impure whatever and we've had

1054
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:29,560
standards doing this stuff for mpls for

1055
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:34,270
ipv4 or ipv6 for a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things for</font>

1056
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:36,370
four decades put it this way why can't

1057
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:40,120
what can you do hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot do</font>

1058
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:42,730
with ethernet OEM and IPO IPO am that we

1059
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:45,460
have what can you do here extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1060
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,200
extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that I mean with easily</font>

1061
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,330
whatever you want to do here you can do

1062
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,609
it with ethernet oh yeah for the overlay

1063
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:58,799
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do em for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the underlay</font>

1064
00:46:53,610 --> 00:47:02,380
this this is why you 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> M because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an NDE</font>

1065
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,280
might encapsulate to one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> more two or</font>

1066
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,350
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> nvs on the other end</font>

1067
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,580
and while it's encapsulating<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it it</font>

1068
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:10,220

<font color="#CCCCCC">down it wants to switch that's why you</font>

1071
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:19,220
need Oh am packets to be originated by

1072

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NP and say not originated by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> angry</font>

1073
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:24,410
you can originate<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Utley so you just</font>

1074
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to test it check the mapping from</font>

1075

<font color="#CCCCCC">the basically you want to check the</font>

1076
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:33,379
correct VX line header is added that's

1077
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:35,540
what you want so yeah but you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1078
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,450
your test<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're testing the path from</font>

1079
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,460
the encapsulating MV e to the d capsule

1080
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:43,009
eating at me and the packets are being

1081
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,450
originated there so you can have a you

1082
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,630
can do it when you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

should specific discussion we should

1086
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,680
have there's a fundamental here around

1087
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,770
who gets to do troubleshooting if it's

1088
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,859
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attendance system keeps fading in</font>

1089
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:06,890
and out tenant system or just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> n ve</font>

1090
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,090
owner I think maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should start from</font>

1091
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,529
the point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we want to</font>

1092
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:13,010
facilitate and then talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1093
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:14,720
architecture so to them to that line<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1094
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,060
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of common terrorists a</font>

1096
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,299
of all having done a lot of over the

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet overlay troubleshooting over</font>

1098
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,100
the last six seven years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you</font>

1099
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's absolutely essential that you</font>

1100
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,819
use the same UDP destination port that

1101
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are using for data packets when you try</font>

1102
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide if something's alive or not</font>

1103
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're paying because very many</font>

1104
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:37,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">times will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a middle box is blocking</font>

1105
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,040
some port but not another and you know

1106
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,930
it is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble so we are we are</font>

1107
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,090
using exactly the same UDP port does

1108
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:47,629
misread the slides no there's there's an

1109
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:49,460
inner UDP port inside transported all

1110
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:51,890
the way inside the overlay that could be

1111
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,480
but the outer V X lon is definitely the

1112
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:56,569
same we're not we're not touching that

1113
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,520
second point is is that I I have to

1114
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,720
congratulate you of using a union<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1115
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,170
every idea when it comes to

1116
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,759
troubleshooting but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will say this is</font>

1117
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,500
that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other problems with</font>

1118
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,380
operationally is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool that</font>

1119
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,210
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to troubleshoot with is</font>

1120
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,160
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> and somehow it so complicated that</font>

1121
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,349
wasn't implemented probably you're

1122
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,629
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck and so I encourage you to</font>

1123
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,609
find a very simple small subset of this

1124
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,160
get some operational feedback and then

1125
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:22,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">add to it over over time yeah so that's</font>

1126
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,430
the other thing that we were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1127
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:27,009
after some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the conversations we have</font>

1128
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,509
these days was to split it into one

1129
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:31,200
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's verifying purely the</font>

1130
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:34,089
tunnels and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other is and systems but</font>

1131
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,250
just less common yeah a clarifying

1132
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:39,130
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric nordmark so you said you</font>

1133
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,529
have you so you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this rather alert</font>

1134
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,720
or OEM bit so is that does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1135
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:47,440
exactly the same semantics is in the GP

1136
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,879
draft how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I as far as I</font>

1137
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,099
read from the GP draft I could

1138
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,720
understand the ideas that is a packet I

1139
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:55,150
mean it would it means it gets punted to

1140
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,308
control plane and in particular in the

1141
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,019
DB<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive it means that it never gets</font>

1142
00:49:57,309 --> 00:50:01,000
forwarded to the understand right that's

1143
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:02,589
not the semantics yeah so that's that's

1144
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,180
my ID I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that packet to be</font>

1145
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:06,269
forwarded the the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I cannot</font>

1146
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:09,129
guarantee that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will happen for non</font>

1147
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">impure VX land it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will not happen for</font>

1148
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:18,009
non router<font color="#E5E5E5"> alert bits aware</font>

1149
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:19,750
implementation so the Sharona myself I i

1150
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:21,250
I'm actually but I'm sorry I'm actually

1151
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,930
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut the conversation on this</font>

1152
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,759
topic it seems like there's a lot of

1153
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:28,089
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation that's happened and a</font>

1154
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:29,589
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need so we'll we'll get</font>

1155
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:31,630
together with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few of you after this</font>

1156
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:33,339
session to chat more about what the next

1157
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:35,319
step would look like but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone should</font>

1158
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">please read these drafts and comment on</font>

1159
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:43,089
the mailing list so thank you thank you

1160
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:44,470
so we have and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I am really</font>

1161
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:46,750
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut that conversation short but</font>

1162
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:49,689
we have about 10 minutes a little less

1163
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:52,210
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that left before we're supposed to</font>

1164
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:54,130
be done here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

1165
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:57,160
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a chance for some open</font>

1166
00:50:54,130 --> 00:51:01,119
discussion of the data plane adoption

1167
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:03,430
that is in process right now if no one

1168
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,039
has comments on it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could break up</font>

1169
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:09,578
early if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any comments questions</font>

1170
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:12,819
or whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a chance to to speak</font>

1171
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:14,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a few minutes it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as a</font>

1172
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,900
reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are in the process of</font>

1173
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,509
adopting we have three calls for

1174
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,960
adoption out right now for the VX<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

1175
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPE</font>

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:29,650
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> goo and for the why am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I forgetting</font>

1177
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the name of the last one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> genève geneve</font>

00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:37,369
where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesse he can yeah I call it</font>

1179
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:41,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">janea we need a pronounced asian guy but</font>

1180
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:42,440
I and do we pronounce it in French I

1181
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,730
mean there's like beer the beer of

1182
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:50,510
working group that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pronounced in</font>

1183
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:57,770
German right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah then this boot</font>

1184
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:59,330
as well so I guess sort of the sort of

1185
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">balance between industry in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1186
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">clarify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be good if we</font>

1187
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:06,200
could the ideal thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1188
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:09,919
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encapsulation</font>

1189
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:12,379
right but I don't not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how that</font>

1190
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,089
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can happen and even if we do we</font>

1191
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,680
still have things that is getting

1192
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,109
deployed out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the basic the</font>

1193
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,598
advanced off so i don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

1194
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:23,930
useful to think about whether the

1195
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,240
participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and sort of wearing a</font>

1196
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:28,220
combination on the IDF hat and they're

1197
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,189
sort of we're deploying there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyhow</font>

1198
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:34,399
hat which you know happens out in the

1199
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:36,380
real world sort of our amenable to

1200
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,260
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font>

1201
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:42,290
we could prune things down a bit and not

1202
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:44,270
end up with sort of these three

1203
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:47,540
potentially being deployed plus whatever

1204
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:49,430
things are out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there existing and one</font>

1205
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might help with our stuff is</font>

1206
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:54,440
is sort of looking at the the

1207
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,869
encapsulations considerations thing and

1208
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,099
there are some thoughts about

1209
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:59,960
extensibility there's many things about

1210
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:05,089
how to encode extensibility in the

1211
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:07,160
pocket so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make it make it a</font>

1212
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:09,740
bit more future proof if people want to

1213
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">build hardware that can use the</font>

1214
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:15,770
extensibility mechanisms which you know

1215
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,660
the encapsulation the design team that

1216
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,250
was looking at this stuff actually came

1217
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we wrote</font>

1218
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">down would seem to sort of point out</font>

1219
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,680
that unconstrained kill these are

1220
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,020
actually very hard to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1221
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,759
hardware sure with the encapsulations

1222
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,319
all of them

1223
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:32,319
the abilities that we can skip the whole

1224
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:34,839
thing right we can pass over these

1225
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,449
extensions but if you in the future say

1226
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:41,859
well there's some security extensions

1227
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:43,239
that are useful I should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1228
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:45,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful to be able to have the hardware</font>

1229
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:47,469
actually parse and insert and actually

1230
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:50,289
do something is all about so and if

1231
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:52,059
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if people have</font>

1232
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:53,919
already looked at that stuff and say

1233
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:56,049
here's something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> make me</font>

1234
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:57,939
tweak my encapsulation and if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1235
00:53:56,049 --> 00:54:00,699
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1236
00:53:57,939 --> 00:54:02,319
get fewer of them I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a</font>

1237
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:03,909
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the working of adopting</font>

1238
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,009
these things instead of refining them

1239
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,299
but I'm thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the world</font>

1240
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,859
going to look like three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now</font>

1241
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:10,689
right are we go or five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> from now</font>

1242
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:12,549
or whatever how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

1243
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:14,828
going to be deployed out there that's

1244
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:16,479
that's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> real concern and I want to</font>

1245
00:54:14,829 --> 00:54:18,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IDF is part of this</font>

1246
00:54:16,479 --> 00:54:20,678
conversation as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to being</font>

1247
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:22,328
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidelined because people</font>

1248
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:24,059
deploy whatever they want and we don't

1249
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:26,709
get the benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort of the</font>

1250
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:29,349
additional review and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of broader</font>

1251
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:34,058
thinking in their yard yeah thank you so

1252
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:37,119
I just to respond I guess I see this as

1253
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:40,029
a present process if it works well we

1254
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,039
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt and document things that</font>

1255
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:47,589
are going to be deployed and or are

1256
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:50,829
deployed now at some point we could do

1257
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:52,839
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that we could maybe come up</font>

1258
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a one of them that we think is is</font>

1259
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:57,219
going to be the you know must implement

1260
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:59,739
standard or perhaps there's a way to

1261
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:02,499
combine ideas or whatever i'm not going

1262
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:05,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know prejudice what the outcome</font>

1263
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:07,569
would be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think trying to balance</font>

1264
00:55:05,229 --> 00:55:09,098
out this recognizing the people are

1265
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:11,259
going to deploy things and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1266
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:13,089
document it on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand versus it'd be</font>

1267
00:55:11,259 --> 00:55:14,709
nice to kind of come together more

1268
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:17,889
coherently and help the community on the

point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's a path we're going</font>

1271
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:25,169
to try to walk any other

1272
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:31,810
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesse Mesa might</font>

1273
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:35,320
default on one specific point to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric</font>

1274
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:38,230
made not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the general process</font>

1275
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,609
just as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the engine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trans kill</font>

1276
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:43,480
these things so I actually happen to

1277
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:45,520
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think five implementation subnet</font>

1278
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,010
at this point in commercials of

1279
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,800
switching silicon in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi target</font>

1280
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:53,099
range including person kill these so I

1281
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,300
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of challenge the</font>

1282
00:55:53,099 --> 00:56:00,880
conventional idea for a little bit

1283
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:04,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">stalker yeah sure on context seem so it</font>

1284
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,630
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we give up on one</font>

1285
00:56:04,089 --> 00:56:10,210
encapsulation because there's a new one

1286
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:13,660
new encoding or encapsulation every

1287
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:17,160
every few weeks or months but at least

1288
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:20,049
have a defined mechanism to negotiate

1289
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:25,029
which encapsulation is used by the two

1290
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:27,400
NV is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be a start and one small</font>

1291
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:32,440
comment to Eric and the OEM the other

1292
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:34,660
one about<font color="#CCCCCC"> race</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route is overlays</font>

1293
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:39,550
inherently support multihoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1294
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:43,290
think any address in advance so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1295
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:43,290
may be multiple ways to get to the same

1296
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:51,118
the only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's yeah let's keep</font>

1297
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,240
the conversation on Mike if we can so to

1298
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,549
add to Sharon's comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dino this is</font>

1299
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,308
dino sorry in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list working group we</font>

1300
00:56:56,549 --> 00:57:01,440
added an encapsulation type format to

1301
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:02,369
the mapping database and right now its

1302
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,099
enumerated seven different

1303
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:06,869
encapsulations and growing so just let

1304
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,660
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that the mapping database could</font>

1305
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:11,369
tell you what v-type address to use as

1306
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,140
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> would encapsulation so it's a</font>

1307
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:14,700
form of negotiation not back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth</font>

1308
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,808
just what I will support and you pick

1309
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,390
one of the ones that you would

1310
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,859
encapsulate it yeah so just sort of add

1311
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:22,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that that means that the control</font>

1312
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:25,619
plane has multiple data plane options as

1313
00:57:22,529 --> 00:57:27,990
a requirement right this is elan go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1315
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:32,879
comment that I made at the virtual

1316
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:35,670
interim as well now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font>

1317
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,559
with one single encapsulation format

1318
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:39,329
that's a standard from my ETF is not

1319
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,769
going to help the industry because you

1320
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:43,319
already have many different and you're

1321
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:46,049
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create one more that the</font>

1322
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:48,569
industry may or may not put up creating

1323
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:53,000
more problems than solving it where it

1324
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:55,529
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful is in the TL vs we're</font>

1325
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,450
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stage where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1326
00:57:55,529 --> 00:58:00,869
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> there where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF can come</font>

1327
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:03,899
and define some some tea LVS that are

1328
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:06,390
useful for maybe future hardware to

1329
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,859
parse it has a request saying and so

1330
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:10,558
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good time to start but have</font>

1331
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,940
that conversation and define some tlv

1332
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,720
that could be adopted as a standard

1333
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:17,880
within the IETF just to clarify you mean

1334
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,410
maybe using the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> T LVS across</font>

1335
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,450
different protocols that's that's

1336
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,029
correct so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the tlv format</font>

1337
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:25,740
at least between two different protocols

1338
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it follows exactly the</font>

1339
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,368
same format so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always go and</font>

1340
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,200
standardize the tlv even though the

1341
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:33,299
outer encapsulation that carries<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TL</font>

1342
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,950
vs might be different you can still

1343
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:40,890
sanitize tlv former that could be useful

1344
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:42,240
in future and it could I mean you you

1345
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:44,339
can get interoperability as well you can

1346
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,660
make it work make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them work together and</font>

1347
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:48,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">also you can make the hardware that</font>

1348
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:50,759
parses<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to interpret it correctly</font>

1349
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:54,640
consistently across the encapsulations

1350
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:57,039
and so will thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will take the</font>

1351
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,690
two people are standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and and</font>

1352
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:00,640
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to close the ques</font>

1353
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,979
because we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do have to</font>

1354
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,920
quit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on time today the plenary isn't</font>

1355
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:07,989
here next but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we go on Tom who</font>

1356
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,299
has the blue sheets and and more

1357
00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:12,519
importantly if you haven't signed the

1358
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:14,650
blue sheets please find them and do so

1359
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:16,988
sorry good Tom hard work so I just

1360
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,809
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so one thing</font>

1361
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:21,609
we are doing in goo is actually defining

1362
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:23,680
several extensions so we have a

1363
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:26,109
fragmentation extension coming up with a

1364
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,089
header checksum and a few others

1365
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:30,969
security is actually very important and

1366
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:32,469
I think most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those could be generic</font>

1367
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:34,509
so for instance if you wanted to apply

1368
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:36,400
those to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now they're in flag</font>

1369
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:39,670
field so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually somehow</font>

1370
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:42,969
separate out the base encapsulation from

1371
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:45,130
how you extend the protocol and say that

1372
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:47,799
for instance DLP's is one mechanism flag

1373
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:50,109
fields would be another but the content

1374
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:52,449
of those may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same or very</font>

1375
00:59:50,109 --> 00:59:58,959
similar and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be a common</font>

1376
00:59:52,449 --> 01:00:00,609
another common point Eric<font color="#CCCCCC"> not my call so</font>

1377
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:02,259
quick response to longer that yeah I

1378
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:03,940
think that's a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

1379
01:00:02,259 --> 01:00:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things that are common in</font>

1380
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,589
terms of I guess not necessarily till

1381
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,949
the encoding but the actual payload and

1382
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:13,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">its semantics right and a it ties in</font>

1383
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:15,369
very well with one of the observations

1384
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:17,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was made in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end caps design</font>

1385
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:19,779
team which is that the times when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

1386
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:22,299
defined these sort of extensions and

1387
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:25,479
having actually use done right they sort

1388
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:27,489
of have become useless<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it can get</font>

1389
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:29,288
implemented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

1390
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:31,150
boxes just drop it on the floor or

1391
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,699
whatever right so maybe there's some

1392
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:36,459
sweet spot whether it's some security

1393
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:38,949
cookie or something that people might

1394
01:00:36,459 --> 01:00:41,589
want where they want sort of better and

1395
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:43,989
protection in this packet infection that

1396
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:46,299
we could we can sort of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's</font>

1397
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:48,969
a starting point let's pick this one and

1398
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:52,390
only define whatever how big it is right

1399
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:54,430
and that if that helps sort of get

1400
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:57,279
across the hump that we have some

1401
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:59,140
hardware support for something that we

1402
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:01,239
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick's and switches right</font>

1403
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,949
and then we can see well the extent it

1404
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:05,829
needs to be next<font color="#E5E5E5"> but maybe they're just</font>

1405
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:07,509
doesn't software but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there we can that</font>

1406
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:10,779
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually help in terms of ensuring</font>

1407
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:14,309
that this is likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> TB be useful down</font>

1408
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:16,180
the road right extensibility becomes

1409
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:19,269
thank thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for the comments</font>
