60
00:10:42,740 --> 00:11:06,490
be problematic looking at is to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">us about mmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are the Nexus TLS and</font>

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:14,620
identity check procedures through email

63
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:18,400
alexa alexa up your that can just to

64
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:23,840
summarize the status that document them

65
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:28,790
right so i just posted 0 2 as you asked

66
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:32,180
which finish unterminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence x I'm</font>

67
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the may change in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 01 was splitting</font>

68
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,349
instead of you know having requirements

69
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,370
and no different type of actors like

70
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,680
mail user client writers on ce

71
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,390
certificate authorities cetera in one

72
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,420
section<font color="#CCCCCC"> I split them in two separate</font>

73
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,630
sections and this actually caught one

74
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:55,760
error and I think I made the

75
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,500
requirements more consistent so I was a

76
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,060
bit skeptical before I did this but I

77
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it actually improves the document</font>

78
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think at this point it's stable</font>

79
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,680
and should be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for working with</font>

80
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,010
Roscoe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's get a quick</font>

85
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:28,260

86
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:32,970
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> say yes I read it it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay see</font>

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">bouquet because even if any doesn't mean</font>

93
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,290
you have to find any fault with it it's

94
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:55,860
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is to say that you read it and</font>

95
00:12:49,290 --> 00:13:01,079

102
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have microphone now okay i did</font>

103
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:55,850
a revision of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's now a</font>

104
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,940
working group draft so so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

105
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the overview of what's in the draft for</font>

106
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,580
people who are part of our spectators

107
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,020
and haven't read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you haven't</font>

108
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,420
read it yet I'd really like you to read

109
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,680
it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to get this done</font>

110
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,899
relatively soon but this is the overview

111
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,560
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's in the draft basically it's a</font>

112
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:21,080
set of things with the intent of

113
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,390
improving confidentiality for the link

114
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,580
between the mail user agent and the

115
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:30,860
server this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about mpa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mkay relay</font>

116
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:35,660
that's that's out of scope for this

117
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:38,390
document so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic overview</font>

118
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:43,430
moving on the changes I made to this

119
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:48,560
revision I i believe technical contents

120
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:50,630
largely complete we renamed the privacy

121
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,029
assurance to confidentiality assurance

122
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,459
and based on Russ's review<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to do</font>

123
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,260
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more wordsmithing about that</font>

124
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:01,010
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the correct terminology</font>

125
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,900
for what this is providing and Irene a

126
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,240
privacy assurance to no privacy

127
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,910
insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I did no confidentiality</font>

128
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,570
assurance because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks</font>

129
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:14,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">better other words the sniffing it's now</font>

130
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,510
a working group draft and I fold it in a

131
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,890
bunch of review comments from my

132
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:24,140
co-author Keith so to do I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall</font>

133
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,420
fold in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments that Russ made i</font>

134
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:29,050
just i read all of them so i'll just

135
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:32,089
make them yell unless there are further

136
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:35,120
comments on that on those topics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

137
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,780
need to add an explicit reference to the

138
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">pls bcp so those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two items that</font>

139
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:44,780
I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and I'm a mitt and I'm</font>

140
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,490
also inclined do a pass over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if</font>

141
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,170
it can improve readability and

142
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:55,160
approachability of the draft a little

143
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:58,490
bit moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next slide so the</font>

144
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,760
old issues so one of the open issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

145

<font color="#E5E5E5">have an item to go gather deployment</font>

146
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,010
data on port 465 versus 587 and I

147
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:11,870
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to gather that data yet</font>

148
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:15,680
so basically right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document is</font>

149
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,780
recommending port 465 over 587 the

150
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,089
recommendation that ends up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

151
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:23,060
document should be backed by what's

152
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:26,030
actually deployed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

153
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:31,880
understand the relative deployment of

154
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:34,970
port 465 versus 587 because yo if we go

155
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,820
with port 465 there are there are

156
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,450
process issues that make that that are

157
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:44,660
challenging so if if it's the case that

158
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,410
port<font color="#E5E5E5"> five days at every isp that offers</font>

159
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:51,560
port 465 also offers port 587 then I

160
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go with port 587 to</font>

161
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,349
avoid the process difficulties but we

162
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,900
need to gather that data so it does

163
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,450
anybody have cycles to gather data<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

164
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:07,790
like significant ISPs and clients

165
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:09,290
support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ports guessing not I</font>

166
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,240
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stays on my plate and they'll</font>

167
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:16,700
try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it done as soon as possible</font>

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,640
the next open<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue this is one that</font>

169
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,810
came up in a discussion Keith and I were

170
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:27,110
having and i wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to i take this this</font>

171
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,730
is a really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for for the</font>

172
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,370
group to<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss there's a design</font>

173
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,790
trade-off in here where the current

174
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">spect the way it's written if you have a</font>

175
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:42,110
no confidentiality assurance account set

176
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:44,960
up and it's not using TLS on that on

177
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,639
those connections and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

178
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,990
server says wait a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm now</font>

179
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:55,550
offering TLS there is a model that the

180
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:59,330
current approach would I will try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

181
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,850
TLS if it uses it if it can use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

182
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,639
though the cert doesn't verify it will

183
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:08,570
it will latch on TLS so that it will

184
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,960
keep using TLS so the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you get</font>

185
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,389
confidential yo if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site wasn't</font>

186
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,640
using TLS and then starts offering it

187
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,610
but without a valid sir it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

188
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,470
get the passive protection so that's how

189
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,870
the current drafts written the downside

190
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,140
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach is there's an obvious</font>

191
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,709
denial of service attack of your Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> asp</font>

192
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:34,000
with no ssl and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i insert a man middle</font>

193
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:37,300
and say hey I'm offering<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL now</font>

194
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,890
I want you to latch it on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

195
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,540
quiet latches it on and now you can't

196
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,970
connect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP anymore so there's a</font>

197
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,680
denial of service attack against the

198
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,270
client with the model that's currently

199
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the draft the other approach is sorry</font>

200
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,100
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain if the certain doesn't</font>

201
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,610
validate we can't latch on SSL and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

202
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,469
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it in the clear yeah well</font>

203
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,199
you're you're all your data will go in

204
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:05,290
the clear on that no confidentiality

205
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,080
assurance connections so that would

206
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:12,180
solve that one denial of service attack

207
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,760
but you lose you lose passive

208
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,460
confidentiality protection so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

209
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,830
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> input from the working group on</font>

210
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,430
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these two approaches they like</font>

211
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,090
better as I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

212
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting question</font>

213
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:34,279
I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that now we go to</font>

214
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:48,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">face to face time like this year's me</font>

215
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:52,009
yeah let's let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yo get some</font>

216
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:54,978
shorter distance was stated in please

217
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:56,570
lugar<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leveson was gained considered for</font>

218
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:59,690
detecting the presence of an ssl

219
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,729
certificate on a particular port and was

220
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,639
there any consideration about possibly

221
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:07,190
updating the auto configuration scheme

222
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:08,959
for indicating that a TLS certificate

223
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,849
should be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and should be</font>

224
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:17,299
required so that you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> start TLS</font>

225
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:20,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">trippin okay so right now well right now</font>

226
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:23,690
this doesn't have very much very many

227
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,179
references to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a yo if</font>

228
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,789
you have a Dane validated certificate

229
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,129
that's not Pete expel dated that's

230
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:35,450
supported in the current in the current

231
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:37,759
document I've had some open issues for a

232
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,129
while where I where if someone

233
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,469
contributes text I'd be I'd be

234
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:45,320
interested in possibly filling that text

235
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:47,869
in so for the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup part of the</font>

236
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,330
document I've got I I explain how to use

237
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:52,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">the existing SRV set up to do a count</font>

238
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up and there</font>

239
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:57,340
there is a way to extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

240
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:59,360
leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane and if somebody added</font>

241
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,249
provided text for me to add to the

242
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,418
document to do that I would most likely

243
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:11,119
be supportive of adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that text</font>

244
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:13,249
independent IDs but but yeah that's

245
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,470
independent of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular problem</font>

246
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:17,419
that i'm raising so anyway if you have

247
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,139
if you want more<font color="#E5E5E5"> dean support in the</font>

248
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:22,730
document submit text to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists of</font>

249
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:25,850
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like added to the</font>

250
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,649
document so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using gain was</font>

251
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,070
to detect when the certificate was

252
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:33,350
changed to avoid this denial of service

253
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,110
problem once the certificate has been

254
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:41,899
pinned to the imap connection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> h st s</font>

255
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:46,039
fashion the other idea was indicating

256
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:51,049
that TLS was mandatory in the SRV<font color="#E5E5E5"> record</font>

257
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:53,269
somehow so my email account setup works

258
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:54,830
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the SRV record only once</font>

259
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:58,519
and you don't generally don't look at it

260
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">again so these so that's why the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HST s</font>

261
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:02,869
style account indicator is in the

262
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:04,730
protocol with with this draft it's not

263
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:07,189
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dead done in the protocol</font>

264
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:10,100
the same way it's done in HD hit p but

265
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,440
you know map to the email model so no

266
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,469
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> where I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not think of</font>

267
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,470
doing a chest es approach in using the

268
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,700
DNS cuz I know and I mean the main

269
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,580
reason I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's very</font>

270
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,710
interesting is right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard it's</font>

271
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,249
very hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your hands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on dnf sec</font>

272
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,559
in a deployment so you know I certainly

273
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:33,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">have I can't like I cannot write DNS</font>

274
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,870
software i cannot get access to servers

275
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:37,340
to test it on sorry

276
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,419
in my head I'm thinking through the

277
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:46,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario of if you can stipulate in DNS</font>

278
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:49,400
system that a server supports TLS then a

279
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,320
client should presumably only connect to

280
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,670
the line how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write have you read</font>

281
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,159
the draft no no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I please do read</font>

282
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and section 8 has</font>

283
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,660
the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SRV yellow account</font>

284
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup model in the draft and it has some</font>

285
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,910
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of advertising</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL in there</font>

286
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,100
and the documented references also has

287
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:16,520
discussion of that so occasionally that

288
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,949
see if it meets your needs and if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

289
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,690
yo let let's see some suggestions for

290
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">text improve the document I appreciate</font>

291
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> David lump under stand on</font>

292
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,450
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer I don't think they can</font>

293
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,070
currently indicate that there must be a

294
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,230
zazzle available I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

295
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,300
refer to the certificate to be used and

296
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,130
authenticate that but that's that's a

297
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,230
bit that's missing from Dana and I think

298
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,300
that needs to be added so I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

299
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,160
support the question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think someone</font>

300
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,559
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go today and at that as a</font>

301
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,260
separate capability but it's not there

302
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,480
as far as in hell yeah I'm generally

303
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,580
keeping that I so far generally kept

304
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,050
this very loosely coupled the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane I</font>

305
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what's in here is mostly</font>

306
00:23:54,050 --> 00:24:00,290
complementary to what day is doing yeah

307
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,790
acute oh yeah I like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> learnt gained in</font>

308
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,710
principle although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that without</font>

309
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">bnsf basically you just create a</font>

310
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,429
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of security holes and so</font>

311
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,970
it

312
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:14,590
getting dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> i deployed is pretty to be</font>

313
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:18,970
quite difficult or slow at least I think

314
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:21,970
I guess you know my feeling is if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

315
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,220
a reliable indication from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

316
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,610
that it now supports pls and will

317
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,769
continue to do so then it's reasonable

318
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:34,119
to trust that and reliable means that

319
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:36,309
it's coming over a TLS encrypted and

320
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,590
authenticated connection with a

321
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,658
certificate that we trust and that we

322
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">have we sort of trust axiomatically and</font>

323
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,389
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have is how do we know</font>

324
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,789
when that's good enough for that purpose

325
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:49,119
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know that I have the answer</font>

326
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of lots of</font>

327
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:54,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">little corner cases there but what's</font>

328
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:57,309
your thinking about that well I mean I I

329
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:59,619
think that case is not controversial yo

330
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:03,999
if if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> validate the server cert</font>

331
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:06,369
and the search says I support pls with

332
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:08,200
cert validation in the session you latch

333
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:10,119
it on your done I think that's already

334
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,720
covered at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the part</font>

335
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:17,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I i think is open to change is the</font>

336
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">part where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I I've been talking to</font>

337
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,539
the account there's there's been no TLS

338
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,259
at all all of a sudden see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can now</font>

339
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,360
do TLS with the server and the server I

340
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,970
can't very validate the sir the cert

341
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,549
doesn't validate but I can get an

342
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:38,139
encrypted cut so that I have at least

343
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:41,830
passive confidentiality and then the

344
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:45,668
server says by the way I I am do I am

345
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:50,039
offering TLS but not offering cert valid

346
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:53,169
certs and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this indefinitely so</font>

347
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,779
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when that scenario</font>

348
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:57,909
happens should the client latch on and

349
00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:00,369
insist on TLS in the future even though

350
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,880
the cert doesn't validate or should the

351
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:04,199
client just use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

352
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,360
session and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time if</font>

353
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,670
there's no TLS sorry you get no

354
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,610
confidentiality those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

355
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:22,290
options I think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

356
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting question I'm not sure we'll</font>

357
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:29,310
actually that's what you should do yeah

358
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:40,649
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peter's naked so validated the</font>

359
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:44,370
search I think it's the opportunistic

360
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:47,040
case and the answer is next time you

361
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,260
arrive<font color="#CCCCCC"> wherever because you can't tell</font>

362
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,110
who you've been talking to the next time

363
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,910
you arrive if it's clear text only and

364
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,280
TLS is not available maybe you were

365
00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:00,210
talking to something bad actor last

366
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:02,879
already got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLS i will just continue</font>

367
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do the opportunistic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though of if the</font>

368
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">TOS is available use it not don't don't</font>

369
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,980
latch because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who the bad</font>

370
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,320
actor in this play is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that clear text I</font>

371
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,550
or the TLS die it could be a denial of

372
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:20,639
service attack by inserting TLS during

373
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,590
the session that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw it well I you</font>

374
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,120
know that's the argument for that side

375
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,550
so I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the argument for the other</font>

376
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:31,770
approach the other coach is I yo if my

377
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:35,040
service provider can't you know for some

378
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:39,240
reason can try sir but he can get TLS on

379
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:43,920
the server I would rather have passive

380
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,020
confidentiality than in the clear and

381
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,620
you know an active attacker can always

382
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:52,679
get me so so that's fine and so I'd

383
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:57,029
actually you know and in the case where

384
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,999
active attacker starts yo pretending to

385
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:04,009
be the sober and saying I want you to I

386
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:06,840
want you to turn on TLS and require it

387
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:08,309
I'm actually okay with a dial of service

388
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,470
attack because the customer will<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

389
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:12,899
the isp and say why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have writer</font>

390
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:16,139
hype<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have any confidentiality all of a</font>

391
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:20,039
sudden and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i write the pressure on</font>

392
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:22,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ISPs too young to roll out proper</font>

393
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:27,289
encryption that that introduces so

394
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,289
that's that's sort of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade up</font>

395
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,918
so keep more again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

396
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,080
things that occurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me I think app</font>

397
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,080
insert is a trusted certain that it's

398
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,759
axiomatic Lee trusted just as much as

399
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,259
one from a trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> signed by trusted CA</font>

400
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,399
yeah i think if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a latch</font>

401
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:48,929
declaration from the server that says we

402
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,479
support this feature from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pin search</font>

403
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:54,990
that you should trust that equally<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

404
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,029
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust one whatever i think if you</font>

405
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,830
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the pincer is</font>

406
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,570
something that's explicit configuration

407
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,009
so just because he's seen a server

408
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cert before doesn't mean a</font>

409
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,279
thing and you should you should

410
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,179
basically it's always fine to try to

411
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,679
negotiate TLS but it's not fine to trust

412
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,480
whatever that server says it's an

413
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,379
indication in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future and the thing</font>

414
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that concerns me is maybe you have bad</font>

415
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,889
actors that advertise this feature and

416
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,449
that's basically done as a way to get

417
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:24,689
people to turn this feature off in their

418
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,799
user agents and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's kind</font>

419
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,119
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens when people don't</font>

420
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,840
understand it's like well let's just

421
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,220
revert to the

422
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,379
behavior because it will probably be

423
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,929
there supported in the user agent and it

424
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,309
doesn't cause the support calls so one

425
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:38,130
way or another I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what tends</font>

426
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,750
to happen so I'd rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

427
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,429
own balance rather not trust it I also

428
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,960
think it's simpler that way it's easy to

429
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:47,220
describe in a way that's likely be

430
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,100
implemented correctly you're on chef

431
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,799
thought and so first of all and you use

432
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,168
the term passive security you don't get

433
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:59,570
passive security if in fact you trust

434
00:29:55,169 --> 00:30:03,600
the certificate and on the other hand

435
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately you can get an incorrect</font>

436
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:13,408
certificate from mid boxes so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

437
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:17,189
active men in the middle attackers which

438
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:19,890
on balance I think would mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

439
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:24,029
for example if you normally deploy your

440
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:27,179
client behind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee shop access</font>

441
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:29,340
point or an airport access point you're

442
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:32,909
vulnerable to this kind of so-called

443
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:40,080
attack so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately you cannot latch</font>

444
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:43,470
in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question maybe it's</font>

445
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,199
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you wish I mean if you will</font>

446
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,350
feel good terrace<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it doesn't</font>

447
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">write a bit you still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can decrypt this</font>

448
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">is but don't latch don't change anything</font>

449
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,480
there's a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do we want to buy</font>

450
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,549
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> to latch on encryption without</font>

451
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,460
authentication so you know passive

452
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,350
production yo yo and what I'm hearing so

453
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,190
far is no we don't want a way to do that

454
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:14,090
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this instance</font>

455
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,860
if that's the rough consensus what I say

456
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,658
you do / to mystically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you clicked</font>

457
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunistically but you don't play</font>

458
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:25,309
with their lunches in this case that's

459
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:27,710
what I'm yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay stupor and so yeah</font>

460
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:32,779
it's tricky go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I mean would it make</font>

461
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:34,519
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> to latch for a short period he was</font>

462
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:36,620
so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case where you have a provider</font>

463
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:41,600
who has a sensor or something like that

464
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,250
right and your pattern is priority that

465
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,689
you're going to pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail every day</font>

466
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:51,049
or something maybe at least people piece

467
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,509
of email yes yell varies from every

468
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:56,269
every few days to every five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

469
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:57,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">right well so it's put it in Super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bowl</font>

470
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:59,809
that i only talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> every week or</font>

471
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,779
something then it's probably okay to not

472
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:03,649
much but you need any weddings or

473
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:05,330
whatever it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> photo op you</font>

474
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">may as well do that from that case but</font>

475
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:11,029
if you if you like just for a day that's

476
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:15,709
a or something then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't fall prey</font>

477
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:19,690
to the coffee shop if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

478
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,690
mail before a large kind of expires

479
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,280
right on the denial of services that

480
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,460
just prefer day when I'd say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

481
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,500
sure it works but<font color="#CCCCCC"> really investing can</font>

482
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,930
wait but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think i could write</font>

483
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a dog even in a way that i think</font>

484
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:45,160
would be implemented well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> costly</font>

485
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just actually be something</font>

486
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,840
like you'd be recommending a lunchtime

487
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:55,469
today or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for subside</font>

488
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,870
services so do you want

489
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,840
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start formulating I'm question</font>

490
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:03,658
froze yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear what keith has to</font>

491
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,090
say I say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the main danger of the</font>

492
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,830
thing that you want is you want to

493
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">upgrade to confidentiality when you can</font>

494
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,639
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also want to minimize the number</font>

495
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,709
of support calls that result from this

496
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,559
neck<font color="#CCCCCC"> admit so that's the trade off a few</font>

497
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:24,240
like that anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of hard</font>

498
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for support people to predict like</font>

499
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,330
here's the timer going off on this

500
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,070
laptop or whatever I feel like that

501
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,580
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes a support situation worse</font>

502
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:38,510
and yeah I would lean against it for

503
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,710
that reason so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's permalink so the</font>

504
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,870
on either hand I you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

505
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,610
quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> my servers that do have</font>

506
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,639
certificates that are verifying that are

507
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:52,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well well the thing I remember I'm</font>

508
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,450
mua holy so MTA relay it's a completely

509
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:56,970
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> in every message stories but</font>

510
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,350
Tiger is pop servers and submitting

511
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,340
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> she does it there's quite a</font>

512
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,299
bunch of those that don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

513
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,809
service as far as i understand i'm not

514
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:10,168
aware of that as a major problem i would

515
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:12,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">if there is data on your submission I</font>

516
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:14,790
map and pop servers with invalid certs I

517
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:17,368
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data because my</font>

518
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:19,379
understanding is that is generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

519
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:21,570
certs are fine on all three of those and

520
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:24,659
this is actually surprising the nation's

521
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,760
get some producers who then this is

522
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,240
surprising because submission servers

523
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's actually zero require</font>

524
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,368
in any of our published standards to

525
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:38,210
validate the cert in any way which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

526
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">why the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to fix David</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

527
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,850
mean I thought it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit more coming</font>

528
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,050
but if it's less common than I think

529
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,969
maybe not watching it's probably the

530
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:48,139
right so it feels like been been going

531
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:56,118
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> shedding this so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me try</font>

532
00:34:48,139 --> 00:35:01,400
the hum question so the the first prom

533
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:04,690
will be if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you believe we should upgrade</font>

534
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,850
but we should latch passive defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

535
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:11,750
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see TLS but can't validate the</font>

536
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:15,440
sir so yes you and the second will be

537
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:19,100
the opposite of weed we don't latch

538
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,040
passionately TLS those ones where both a

539
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,290
rival any more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah end of</font>

540
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,380
their adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the first column</font>

541
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:34,850
which is upgrade from those security to

542
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:38,060
pass a defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> their businesses laughs</font>

543
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:43,368
it off reactions are that's big leche

544
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:45,590
and we can do ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lap shock option</font>

545
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:48,470
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come slightly</font>

546
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:53,740
because because I was proposing in your

547
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:58,788
hangar sir left<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in charge</font>

548
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:08,828
so now hon if do not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lunch</font>

549
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:08,829
and education here

550
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:19,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best against infection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> land no</font>

551
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,670
discharges you mentioned HST s yes

552
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,670
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> models of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

553
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:27,100
model there's a section on using cell

554
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:32,050
signed cert in conjunction with hsps and

555
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:34,540
RFC 6 7 97 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically says you got</font>

00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,910
that text and add and see if if there's

choose that don't latch option speak up

right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a preference but</font>

we're really broken if we do it that way

about changing that as in should I say

ok the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back has now changed that</font>

582
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,650
cipher suite is no longer mandatory to

00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:15,670
recommends Shawn Turner yes updated

586
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:22,900
please ah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexei I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hear what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

587
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:25,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to say this yes implementations are</font>

588
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,660
using standard libraries so they use

589
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:32,470
whatever is bundled so although an app

590
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:34,420
doesn't recommend using TLS 1.2 I assume

591
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,598
a lot of clients and so as actually do

592
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:41,140
in practice so I don't see a problem

593
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,089
with updating this is very bottom line

594
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,740
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really means is advice to</font>

595
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:49,779
the library maintainer well it's

596
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,779
actually because it's in the imap stack

597
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,210
it advice to imap implementers when

598
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:03,430
selecting which library<font color="#CCCCCC"> and version to</font>

599

you yes i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure i need</font>

600

given the comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got caramel site</font>

601
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:12,069
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just change it ok the next</font>

602
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,500
bullet is a improved document

603
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:16,569
organization actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> their question yet</font>

604
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:22,809
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just I'm up don't you run till</font>

605
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:24,110

submission

607
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:30,020
not have a mandatory to implement i

608
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,090
believe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it inherits what's in the TLS</font>

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">free the same so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could actually want</font>

614
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,630
me to explicitly update all three

615
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:53,090
documents to set a mandatory to

implement to what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp sets this is</font>

617
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:58,670
people a recommendation from the

<font color="#E5E5E5">security folk is the other choice is to</font>

619
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:04,340
go in the other direction and say you

620
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,930
dereference whatever TLS says to be

621
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what you want to do and so they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">get out of line now specifically and say</font>

623
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,290
what's man for you it is written over

624
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:16,670
there don't look over there does that

625
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:18,830
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant actually activities</font>

626
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:25,880
to say it's mandatory with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

reference the you Toby CPM and that will

629
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:35,120
get updated as it goes well you're not

630
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:39,200
specified ok actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Saudi so what I</font>

631
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,720
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an update to expect</font>

632

deleting the mandatory to impress i

633
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,848
implement cipher from there

634

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to the current PCP yeah I'm</font>

637
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:08,680
see something about the first bullet

638
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:09,660
sure can we finish this section so I'm

665
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:34,740
minority don't so these so you're saying

666
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:40,400
the data is that anybody who has

667
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:42,680
465 also has 587 yes with start TLS yes

668
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,350
if that is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saying that</font>

suggests data supports a a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

670
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:51,540
draft yo and so one of the reasons the

671
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:55,140
draft has written the current way is its

672
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of architectural</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II Queen to say yo</font>

00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,690
for imap pop and submit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer the</font>

674
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,149
separate court because that's deployed

675
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,770
but what we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to what I'm</font>

677
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:09,210
and pop we prefer the separate port

678
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:11,700
because if you survey the providers the

679
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:14,400
separate court I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> f and pop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that yo</font>

682
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,210
also available but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other is not true</font>

683
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,070
you can find providers with a separate

684
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,800
court but not start healing what and

685
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:29,940
significant you know but if the opposite

686
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,250
is true of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SMD p suggestion then then</font>

687
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,230
then it makes the spec more more

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,119
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write number strictly</font>

689

don't although that is a tiny survey

690
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,840
that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's food with the</font>

691
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:41,670
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mailboxes in this content so</font>

692
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,590
it's sort of it it's an interesting it's

693
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,510
interesting setup written yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

694
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do a slightly bigger survey</font>

695
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:50,220
but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

696
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,740
if you know somebody who might be able

697
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,839
to get me data on a slightly bigger data

698
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,979
set I really appreciate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past my more</font>

699
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,830
abilities if they have but they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

700
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,010
lying around<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thank you very</font>

701
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,009
much

702
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,660
I think there were more reasons besides

703
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:08,190
just deployment that a separate court

704
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,069
seemed to make more sense and I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

705
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,289
is the the inventor of stock pls<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

706
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:16,470
don't necessarily recall what they were

707
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:18,150
i feel like the issue with a separate

708
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,279
quarters originally if you try to sort

709
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,579
of do opportunistic upgrades you've got

710
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:26,760
some vulnerabilities there but is long

711
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:29,640
as you have things latched then I think

712
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,970
the separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> port is actually better so</font>

713
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,230
i think the desirable end state is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

714
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,390
we use the separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for these</font>

715
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:40,130
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually deprecated use</font>

716
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:42,420
of the of the unencrypted board so

717
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:45,089
either why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to avoid</font>

718
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:53,390
declaring the desirable in state to be

719
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:57,690
you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> us for a submission yeah</font>

720
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:00,359
there's some controversy because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i heard</font>

721
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:03,839
both sides i'm relatively neutral on

722
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:06,839
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I although I actually do feel</font>

723
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,670
fairly strongly about the text in the

724
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:11,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">current document that says we should</font>

725
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:15,630
register port 465 as a port that has

726
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:19,250
dual use in the wild and I know the

727
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,250
registry folks won't like that

728
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:33,950
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm a believer in reality / /</font>

729
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:36,859
process so steam from a big piece issue

730
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:39,319
and yeah I'm back to mandatory to

731
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,520
implement all right sorry I'm not

732
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,770
entirely remembering what the be speed

733
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,840
the generic PCP says but I think it has

734
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:46,970
like a few because we're talking about

735
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,350
TLS in the board it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some</font>

736
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,209
recommendations but also says<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

737
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,680
these other side / suites that are still

738
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,260
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or if you're in this situation</font>

739
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,609
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> catering for</font>

740
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,740
like you know the job environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

741
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:59,810
have the short diffie-hellman values and

742
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:03,069
so on right I think in this case we

743
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't we don't have to be so constrained</font>

744
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:09,500
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

745
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,930
study<font color="#CCCCCC"> weapons if it's not quite to say</font>

746
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,640
pointed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp you want to say 22 bcp</font>

747
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,890
and use the propeller beside for sweets

748
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,600
is the miniature right i saw a

749
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,490
discussion about that on another draft

750
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,740
and so I was going to prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

751
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,020
cipher suites in this section are the

752
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,100
part of the mandatory to implement but I

753
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,200
think in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can kind of tie</font>

754
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:32,000
it down very very tightly for right for

755
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,040
these programs so Alexi said it's 73 you

756
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,410
can pick one I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font>

757
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,029
can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> here Polly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok did you know who</font>

758
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,609
says I'm you know that the future oceans

759
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,670
and

760
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:45,450
he's gonna make those distinctions or

761
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:51,420
have those so it makes sense since for

762
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:53,009
simplicity is key reference to the

763
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,900
reference when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we update to disappear</font>

764
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:57,150
yeah neither have we don't necessarily

765
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,549
grant you so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp doesn't have some</font>

766
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,930
things that are probably not ideal we

767
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:06,509
probably don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have those coming</font>

768
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:07,890
in here if it's feasible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> let up so</font>

769
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:09,180
you're exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing we use I</font>

770
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,920
don't really care of it you know just

771
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:16,890
point out the best bits of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bcp not</font>

772
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:18,869
that the ones you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live it so I</font>

773
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:22,558
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> working I feel like the thing with</font>

774
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:24,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher suites is if you tie this to</font>

775
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,989
some external document that can change

776
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:29,910
then you might actually break in or

777
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:33,029
ability when that set of cipher Suites

778
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:34,319
changes and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have skew between one</font>

779
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:36,180
implementation and other about which

780
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,038
things they implement so I actually

781
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,419
think that the time unit you're going to

782
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:41,910
have a binding of those things you

783
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">should bind to a specific document not</font>

784
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,960
to you know like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp number or</font>

785
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that and even though we</font>

786
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,440
realize these recommendations will

787
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,329
change over time that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

788
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,180
propagated back to the application

789
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:56,130
protocol specs yeah I must buy anything

790
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really matters the way we do</font>

791
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:03,680
references<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference will point to a</font>

792
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:10,589
specific RFC not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp general yeah</font>

793
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:13,680
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes this has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been very helpful so</font>

794
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:19,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any more on the first three bullets</font>

795
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,609
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am oh you got one</font>

796
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:32,279
saw something move yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not</font>

797
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:35,219
just to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the start TLS versus</font>

798
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:37,380
the register port and whether it's which

799
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:41,039
one of them and better<font color="#CCCCCC"> adorable</font>

800
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">distraction so whatever case matures in</font>

801
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,979
the end I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it needs to be</font>

802
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:49,558
written in the document in what sequence

803
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:51,269
the client should do these things and

804
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,150
the server should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things because</font>

805
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:56,488
otherwise we'll just add more ability

806
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:58,920
problems to whatever we have my hair

807
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:05,609
already just the general engineering

808
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:08,670
thing thank you yeah what I may try to

809
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:11,098
do on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is to write the text for both</font>

810
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:13,199
which of course involves the sequencing

811
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,900
text and then we'll see how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hate</font>

812
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:20,719
that text and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually go</font>

813
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,719
for that yo tune towards one

814
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,290
okay moving on to the fourth bullet

815
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,770
there has been some controversy on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

816
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:40,340
list about document or<font color="#E5E5E5"> court</font>

817
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:42,410
organization and clearly and so I mean I

818
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,310
by the way the documents currently

819
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:48,740
structured is I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a set of yo</font>

820
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:51,710
yo there are a set of ideas that all

821
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,419
move towards the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal I wrote them</font>

822
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,760
roughly in the order I thought of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thug</font>

823
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,590
and then I tried to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I moved</font>

824
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,240
from around to try to eliminate<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

825
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,100
references so that's the current

826
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,890
document organization I will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend</font>

827
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:08,779
that as an algorithm to get an ideally

828
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:12,290
readable document so I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to</font>

829
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:14,780
suggestions on reordering sections in

830
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:20,570
the document and restructuring it to try

831
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:24,170
to make it clearer my request on this

832
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:26,680
topic is that the as that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the term bcp</font>

833
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:30,920
not be used as part of this discussion

834
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,779
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okaying various organizations but i</font>

835
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,740
don't but i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think bcp is a</font>

836
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:41,150
constructive categorization mechanism

837
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:43,189
partly because you can talk to two

838
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:46,640
different IETF people and get two

839
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:49,940
different thoughts on what should go in

840
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,430
and bcp and what shouldn't so I'd like

841
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have this discussion at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the level of</font>

842
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,600
can we put this section before a disc

843
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,220
session and one of the things I wanted

844
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,410
to point out

845
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:03,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">Russ actually made some suggestions on</font>

846
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:05,609
reordering sections that I thought made

847
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:10,270
sense to me and I'll just do them so

848
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:15,220
anyway I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invite suggestions to</font>

849
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:18,670
improve the organization it did anyone

850
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,950
want to have additional comments on that

851
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:25,270
topic or shall we just continue

852
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:27,129
discussing that on the list just because

853
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:30,880
would a choice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any male in this</font>

854
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:34,450
discussion so so looking at business

855
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,869
that dokument tries to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bdcp remember</font>

856
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:40,859
others who might waste and discarding

857
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:40,859
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in today</font>

858
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:49,460
about to go bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally find it</font>

859
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:51,619
interesting if somebody would<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font>

860
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:57,020
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe about the draft saying</font>

861
00:51:51,619 --> 00:52:00,640
this is how it is done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> election</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

863
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,810
package all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a separate</font>

864
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:08,440
thing that's a completely enslaved

865
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:12,290
somebody has information out there about

866
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:16,190
the employment experience high hopes

867
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:18,859
high security interesting to get that

868
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:20,900
some of that down on paper that's not

869
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:23,540
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to do right yeah so</font>

870
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:26,089
good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am this documents focused on</font>

871
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:29,240
the MUA to server<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawks you know pop</font>

872
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">IMAP and submission only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the MTA</font>

873
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">relay hot too hot model is different and</font>

874
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:42,470
is very different<font color="#CCCCCC"> and broken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

875
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:44,720
some sort of de facto agreements

876
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:49,040
happening out there right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

877
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:50,990
wild but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you my</font>

878
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:55,550
involvement with service providers as a

879
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:58,339
mail server engineer is that yo service

880
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">providers are having to wire up special</font>

881
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:02,599
one-to-one agreements for certificate

882
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,460
validation right now because the

883
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,619
standard there is nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> written down</font>

884
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,770
that's clear enough about how to

885
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:11,599
validate certs and if you do write

886
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,660
something you have to write well you can

887
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,430
validate this way which is secure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

888
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,109
lot of sites don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so you have</font>

889
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:21,980
to validate it this way which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

890
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:25,540
secured properly and so the current

891
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:28,330
practice is there is no

892
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,480
Oh active attacker protection for MTA

893
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:33,850
MTA<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawks right now when hit bottom line</font>

894
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:38,620
except ones that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been specifically</font>

895
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:40,630

931
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:50,040
email yet Chris can you explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

932
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:52,050
you know I'm completely forgetting

933
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,349
someone explain it well but say a client

934
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:57,450
latches on 1.1 and the TLS 1.2 so the

935
00:55:55,349 --> 00:56:00,180
server says hey I'd you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

936
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:02,580
only in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clyde latches the surrogates</font>

937
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:06,109
upgrading because 1.2 when does the

938
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:09,720
client when is it able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade to 1.2</font>

939
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so with the latching model yeah well</font>

940
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,770
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that there isn't a one point</font>

941
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:18,810
where unlatched<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't see Nolan</font>

942
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:22,200
implement in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah suppose you</font>

943
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:24,420
have 10 laps but the 10 latch needs is

944
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made a commitment to</font>

945
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,980
support TLS 10 or later that's what the

946
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:36,180
latch means<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so i skipped that part</font>

947
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:39,030
okay sorry so as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server so</font>

948
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:40,740
what happens if when 10 gets we find out

949
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,540
that groups that's not so hot anymore we

950
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,569
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of back and they want to</font>

951
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,210
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like 1.3 or whatever and don't</font>

952
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:51,240
do anything it's below whatever version

953
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,700
so so there's a 12 latch right right now

954
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,560
and when 13 comes out we can go see what

955
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,250
the relapse but the client so<font color="#CCCCCC"> book for</font>

956
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the clients and so basic</font>

957
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:06,580
what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's if the if the</font>

958
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:09,310
server says I'm offering 12 and I want

959
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:11,890
you to lash it then the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> will lash</font>

960
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:16,090
it I assuming it successfully negotiates

961
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:17,470
12 invalidates the sir no no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

962
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,610
going through my<font color="#CCCCCC"> head that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

963
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">review the job to make sure that that's</font>

964
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,670
clear because I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

965
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,460
as we get newer versions that it's like

966
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,290
oh that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm yes yeah I'm of</font>

967
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,390
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know deep in the implementing</font>

968
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:34,900
and I've been doing emails and since you

969
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:37,330
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the late 80s so I am yo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

970
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:39,400
no pretend that this is the clearest

971
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,960
document it could be so I right now I'm

972
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,670
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to clarity improvement</font>

973
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,050
honestly when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read it I was like it's</font>

974
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,370
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good I mean like it's kind of on</font>

975
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,660
point it was clear there were some

976
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,220
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you had in the back of us</font>

977
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,750
should we put this out do all that I was

978
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like man it seems like more work for you</font>

979
00:57:49,750 --> 00:58:00,550
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should try to keep it easier on</font>

980
00:57:51,550 --> 00:58:02,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document offers this is people make</font>

981
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:06,130
the same coin which organs I don't

982
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:09,070
remember but<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the client have the</font>

983
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:12,340
option to say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't accept one of</font>

984
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:18,580
laches cuz I don't know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was screwed</font>

985
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:21,370
up right I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is is they're</font>

986
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:24,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come a point where we write a</font>

987
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:26,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp that says deal us you're always hose</font>

988
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:32,460
you should not use it anymore it's as

989
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:36,780
bad as using bad bogan crypto

990
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:41,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clarence should say I don't watch or</font>

991
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 even if you tell me to is that it is</font>

992
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:49,349
a possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what you're ready well</font>

993
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:52,470
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> cert certainly if a DCP says</font>

994
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:54,690
don't use 10 then then when you've set

995
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:57,330
the 10 laps whatever meat is actually

996
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:06,030
negotiate 12 that's what the lash would

997
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:11,490
need in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case because that because</font>

998
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:12,869
the latch is defined as<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or later now</font>

999
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:15,029
I'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> an assumption here that we</font>

1000
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:16,950
won't release a subsequent TLS version

1001
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:18,589
that's worse than the previous version<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1002
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:26,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">hate that assumption is correct</font>

1003
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:28,650
otherwise the design is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob right or the</font>

1004
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,210
other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know TLS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Forks</font>

1005
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,410
in such a way that the version numbers

1006
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:34,140
are no longer linear but there's some

1007
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,430
other facility besides TLS that you

1008
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,290
might want to start using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1009
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is latched Els will sort of</font>

1010
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:41,009
need to walk back up and do something

1011
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,680
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're not necessarily planning</font>

1012
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:46,380
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why there's a</font>

1013
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,000
registry of tags so we actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1014
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,710
we did plan for that because you can

1015
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,930
define you new latch tags<font color="#CCCCCC"> in future yeah</font>

1016
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:57,089
this area envisioning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server</font>

1017
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:58,440
supports 1.3<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then somewhere down the</font>

1018
00:59:57,089 --> 01:00:00,779
line some other technology becomes

1019
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,300
favored and I mean with the clients of

1020
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,660
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> rushed 13 and we'd have to define</font>

1021
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:09,330
the latches in such a way that it's like

1022
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:13,779
you know X Y Z 1 point 0 and actually

1023
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:25,660
greater than or equal to TLS 1.3 yeah

1024
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:34,030
I um have on this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's about</font>

1025
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:37,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so tons like um lots of inputs are</font>

authors mail client authors and get them

01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:02,259
to review<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we weren't so if anybody</font>

has contacts at their company with mail

1037
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:06,790
client authors i would appreciate

1038
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:09,130
comments from them because there's

1039
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:11,620
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem in the email space of</font>

1040
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:14,980
most of the specs or written by server

1041
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:17,529
event yo server engineers and the plan

1042
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:20,290
so i intend you no input from client

1043
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:21,910
engineers it's hard to find so any help

1044
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:31,390
in getting that input i really

1045
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:37,390
appreciate us at the end of a agenda we

1046
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:38,830
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> connect um as you can all see</font>

approaching the you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorta see me</font>

1049

under the light at the end of the tunnel

1050

1052
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,820
progressed and that's some sort of

1053
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:58,180
general advice of opportunistic sir cage

1054
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,890
for TLS it's cooler out of conversation

1055
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">with Stephen I don't know if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1056
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:04,779
speak to this topic Stephen but is that

1057
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:08,939
cool to any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that we even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

1058
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:12,520
the problem is and have to formulate

1059
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:15,700
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was so but some things that</font>

1060
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,130
they understand that any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of general</font>

1061
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,649
they realize

elastic security<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgive us and feel</font>

1063
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:29,579
that way comes or describe that problem

1064
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:35,910
well feel free to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

1067
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:47,279
drafts about Service over security to

1068
01:02:44,759 --> 01:02:48,990
chase somebody round to do that after

1069
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're not seeing each other on to</font>

1071
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:58,200
molecular should take on now's the time

1072
01:02:55,349 --> 01:03:01,049
to go home and try to sort of pen to

paper and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest work in the final</font>

drafts this is a black time so this is

1075
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:19,890
Pete just the organizational stuff since

1076
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:23,839
we've been talking before the meeting so

1077
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:23,839
I'm stepping down as a wednesday

1078
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:30,180
normally I would just transfer stuff

1079
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:32,490
over to Barry since I don't have a

1080
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:33,769
replacement<font color="#E5E5E5"> but where the process of</font>

1081
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:36,479
doing a little bit of iesg

1082
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:40,109
reorganization one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we did</font>

1083
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,930
was make it possible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a directors</font>

01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:44,670
that are not in the area be responsible

1085
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:46,618
for the group I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still useful</font>

1086
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:48,150
to have this is an absurd a regular

1087
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:50,579
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage</font>

1088
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:53,860
applications people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looking at</font>

1089
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:56,530
this that it's for them

1090
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:58,240
it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephen is running to be</font>

1091
01:03:56,530 --> 01:04:01,120
the irresponsible I am irresponsible

1093
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:06,069
going forward so lightly at the next

1094
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,180
week when a little shuffle those on

1095
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:14,310
Stephen will end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> his name on the</font>

01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:17,319
data tracker for the responsible AED and

1097
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:19,390
there is a word document and publication

1098
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,480
requested which magically become siemens

1099
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:24,370
problem instead of mon-sol

1100
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,650
reconfirmation formation by<font color="#CCCCCC"> wednesday of</font>

1101
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:29,500
ever will see if I'm very motivated in

1102
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,480
these next day or barrier one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us will</font>

1103
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:34,950
do the ad evaluation point it will get

<font color="#E5E5E5">it unstuck you know goal in the process</font>

1105
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:39,069
so then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> question the comments about</font>

1106
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:41,050
that bad that's pretty much what we're

1107
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:43,360
planning at this point there could

1108
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:48,910
always be changes but that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

maybe 50 break that was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

1112
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:10,259
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> space</font>

actually

1115
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,650
interesting

1116
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:55,770
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that</font>
