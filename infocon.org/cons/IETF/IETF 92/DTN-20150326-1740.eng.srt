1
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:11,340
so the we would like to the purpose of

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:14,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:21,060
be to the main purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this meeting</font>

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:22,830
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to come to an agreement on the</font>

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:30,259
way forward with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group which</font>

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:33,540
is the milestones and and work items so

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:37,890
we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,100
time necessary for that and hopefully

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,660
come to an agreement and depending on if

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,510
time remains then we may have a

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:54,239
presentation by<font color="#CCCCCC"> add about security</font>

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,280
protocol we are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky to have</font>

13
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:03,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone who volunteer to be a working</font>

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:16,160
various tests that we have the blue

20
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:53,440
any changes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see on the</font>

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:02:01,090
agenda once then so to help other

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:06,280
discussion about the milestones let me

23
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:08,950
see if this goes well we we've done two

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,780
things in the working group since we

25
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:17,018
chartered one is identifying a list of

26
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:23,440
work items which is on your left if you

27
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:25,560
may recall and we essentially list a

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,859
list of potential work items and then

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be done later and</font>

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:39,720
you know later or<font color="#E5E5E5"> never then we worked</font>

31
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:44,170
on the use cases and we agreed on those

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">some time ago so i'm not going through</font>

33
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,570
all of them in detail so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we try to</font>

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:55,570
do is then kind of combine those two

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:57,549
into things that are more clearly

36
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,400
milestones and deliverable and work

37
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:06,220
items which is the thing i just

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:09,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented so i'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will be able</font>

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to play between those two all the time</font>

40
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:20,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if you if we need then we'll do so</font>

41
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:24,030
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I did the first version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and</font>

42
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,339
then so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not looking like a</font>

43
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,040
completely stupid between in front of

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,700
people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked clever people more clever</font>

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:38,200
than me to review it and we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to</font>

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:41,399
this this afternoon and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is far</font>

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">from being you know</font>

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:49,690
the answer of the my songs but just a

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:54,470
proposal to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> ALP to discuss</font>

50
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the working group so the so the</font>

51
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:03,829
milestones are listed there with the

52
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:07,670
potential status such as standards racks

53
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:10,489
or in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Finnish informational and below</font>

54
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">our work items who are not do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font>

55
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:16,418
specific deliverables and there's a

56
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,760
remaining topic at the bottom that that

57
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:22,340
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room agreed to maybe</font>

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,990
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should think about discussing with</font>

59
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,289
the up sorry about network management

60
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,430

62
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:40,700
see if you have comments suggestion

63
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:45,020
proposals changes that makes sense for

64
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:53,860
those milestones and work items mike is

65
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:53,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">in on the floor now including I agree</font>

enrolled shortest<font color="#E5E5E5"> workgroup meeting</font>

67
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">kevin faulk re going on so so in listing</font>

68
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,660
these you mean to achieve some consensus

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,180
document results on each one of these

70
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,860
things is that what you mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is</font>

71
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:28,670
that the semantics of it being up here

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:38,110
and I'm bullet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marked stolons</font>

73
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:41,900
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike okay so yeah but each of these</font>

74
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:51,080
milestones IE documents deliverables

75
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:55,099
right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document is there I mean you</font>

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,510
know I guess what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> really saying is</font>

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,420
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if you have pop count on</font>

78
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,490
there and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is determined at some point</font>

79
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,060
that having a hop count is not a good

80
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:11,000
idea there would be a statement in and

81
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">revise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty-fifty about these are the</font>

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,400
topics that that looks like should be

83
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,630
touched there but we may you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

84
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,239
working group is the is the is<font color="#E5E5E5"> God right</font>

85
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,000
yeah well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say in putting the</font>

86
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,700
bullet there your thing this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,040
covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow think oh wait we got</font>

88
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,620
discussed right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font>

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what will be in the final document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

90
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,550
know but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the working consensus</font>

91
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,610
about what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be touched</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

92
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,920
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and it doesn't make sense</font>

93
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,070
then you just remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but we I don't</font>

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we need to specify the table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:52,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">contents so each document at this point</font>

96
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,130
where no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to understand</font>

97
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,160
what you meant by it being in as a is a

98
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,010
working sort of draft item there these

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,150
would be things as up to this point

100
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:07,610
people seem to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss yes yes</font>

101
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,888
okay and these are those sub bullets or

102
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,439
isn't she

103
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:14,199
from the previous discussion yet so

104
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,810
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> new there it was just</font>

105
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">group so that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea where they</font>

106
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,270
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in terms of documents and</font>

107
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:28,449
deliverables given for example of gun

108
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:29,979
was a topic where we some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

109
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,849
discussion where maybe it's a header

110
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:36,008
thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we be in in 5050 but if the</font>

111
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,620
working group finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not useful</font>

112
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:40,990
not relevant or done other ways and

113
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:49,000
we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove it there's no contract</font>

114
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:50,770
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Rick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Taylor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Airbus and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,479
want to reiterate one of the topics that

116
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,258
came out of the conversation earlier on

117
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,500
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an a general intention to keep</font>

118
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:02,080
the documents short and sweet rather

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,860
than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a dressing into the</font>

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">50-50 base document the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of rough</font>

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,759
consensus we had enough in the pre

122
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,650
meeting was short sweet documents and

123
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,210
I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the working group kind</font>

124
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:19,359
of agrees with that approach rather than

125
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:20,469
writing monolithic tones yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

126
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,930
clarifying that Rick because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

127
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:28,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is an important point any other</font>

128
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,199
comments

129
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:38,309
I think the chairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd need to know and</font>

130
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,870
the ad that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you support this so it would</font>

131
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,209
be good that you come to the mic if you

132
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,210
support or you disagree if you're all

133
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:53,580
silent then we're we're naturally making

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">tolerant networks like epidemic maxpro</font>

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,610
and other routing protocols to say to

146
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,469
test and two to have an idea about the

147
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:40,710
feasibility of disruption protocols on

148
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:42,450
these days<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTM or it's something else so</font>

149
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:47,040
that that topic is actually come up

150
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:52,500
several times and when we first

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,579
discussed it during november it was this

152
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,770
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are interested</font>

153
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">in but as soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we started talking</font>

154
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,710
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would do it it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly got</font>

155
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of people really weren't</font>

156
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,950
sure yet so it got put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list of</font>

157
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,050
secondary items one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking at</font>

158
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,980
that is there are things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

159
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,780
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the dt NRG about to</font>

160
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,300
see if there's interest there to start

161
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">picking up this stuff with the idea that</font>

162
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,020
we have a path for taking work out of

163
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,339
the RG and bring it into the IETF for

164
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Standardization if there's something</font>

165
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,350
that that fits in there but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

166
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,870
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font>

167
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:37,410
within a dtn is something that we really

168
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,360
would bite off here that didn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

169
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,350
be at the top of the of the priority

170
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,350
list during our discussions

171
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:51,190
bob is bob cole and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into this</font>

172
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:56,199

173
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:59,620
down the the bullet on convergence layer

174
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,090
adapter requirements so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's</font>

175
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,940
a there's kind of two different

176
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:08,140
scenarios where d TNS considered being

177
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,840
deployed space<font color="#CCCCCC"> and terrestrial is it</font>

178
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,270
does it deserve a bigger requirements

179
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,090
discussion about when you get into

180
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:22,120
trade-offs between large bundles small

181
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:25,300
bundles error correction how to converge

182
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,350
on you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> boise deal environment</font>

183
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,880
versus a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long distance i delay how do</font>

184
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,170
you make those trades in this working

185
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,220
group so Scott you can jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

186
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:41,829
correct me if i say this incorrectly

187
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,720
these requirements were necessarily to

188
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,210
cover all those cases it's the minimum

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,800
set of things that the bundle protocol

190
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:54,400
would expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have from a convergence</font>

192
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you said but I'll think about</font>

it first CC he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correct me so</font>

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,450
he gets a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarity no I just want</font>

195
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,890
to amplify a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schiaparelli</font>

196
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,570
just just say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more about</font>

197
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we were talking about</font>

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:25,690
intent is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide some hints to the</font>

to the implementer as 20 the implementer

of a convergence layer adapter as to

what the adapter needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

204
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,960
what the functions are that have to be

the specific requirements and that would

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,580
motivate the

there shouldn't be any normative

language in the inbound protocol spec

<font color="#CCCCCC">that says use this under these</font>

219
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:24,250
conditions I think the there will be

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,270
deployment or operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> lure that will</font>

221
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,400
emerge from operating the protocols and

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,490
eventually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe needs to be</font>

223
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,370
standardized somewhere but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it'd</font>

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,220
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> way premature to to start trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">their protocol under these circumstances</font>

227
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:02,239
romain felt to me this looks like the

228
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,699
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we agreed upon in the interim</font>

229
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,240
meeting that we had in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December the</font>

00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">WebEx meeting so yeah my support is</font>

231
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,889
Rick Taylor again<font color="#E5E5E5"> first off I support</font>

232
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:27,100
this and then because we've all got a

233
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:29,800
bit quiet can I ask the question to the

234
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:43,029
chairs really what's next<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we</font>

235
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:44,410
start this for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not paying</font>

236
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:49,149
attention we were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get Martin's</font>

237
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,469
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing here is is</font>

238
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,050
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to identify the</font>

239
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,029
milestones and the milestones are an

240
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,680
agreement between the work group and the

241
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:01,990
ad so one once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a a rough</font>

242
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,089
estimate of when we think those things

243
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be ready to move we can update the</font>

244
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,290
milestones Martin can beat us over the

245
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,230
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're way too optimistic we</font>

246
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,899
can then start working which means if

247
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,600
people have ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ones they want to</font>

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for we can start</font>

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:25,839
writing names down and getting those

they're laying real events sick and he

290
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,060
asked what is the difference between

291
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:03,630
node neighbor discovery and enhanced

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well let me let me answer the</font>

298
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,810
question i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think was asked so the one</font>

299
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,860
that's listed above in milestones is

300
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:31,629
taking what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was done in in the RG and</font>

301
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,949
standardizing it the work item down at

302
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,270
the bottom which doesn't have a

303
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,340
deliverable right now is actually

304
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at other potential options for</font>

305
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,290
doing neighbor discovery Rick could

306
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,970
actually mentioned one that was in the

307
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,889
man a working group that may have some

308
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,550
applicability but we need to determine

309
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">if that if that makes any sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:11,740
and work items<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

314
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,439
security protocol and generally security

315
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,030
models for dtn if you have come and

316
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,140
volunteered please see me at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

317
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:24,190
the meeting so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make sure that I</font>

318
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:27,309
have names appropriate thank you Rick

319
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,110
Taylor again one thing these milestones

320
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,200
and work items don't that there's no

321
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,000
dependency graph obviously here and some

322
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,890
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I know we're trying to do some</font>

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,570
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work in parallel to show</font>

324
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:42,910
progress but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 50 potential base is</font>

325
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,010
quite an important piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work and so</font>

326
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,809
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how that needs to be</font>

327
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,129
recorded if it does need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> recorded</font>

328
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,440
but there has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an understanding</font>

329
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,929
that that some things have got to make

330
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:58,000
progress faster than others<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just felt</font>

331
00:19:52,929 --> 00:20:01,090
it what you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah no that's that's a</font>

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,890
good point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we'll end</font>

333
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,899
up seeing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as advancing</font>

334
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:09,250
it for publication<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5050 bits would have</font>

335
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,440
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> first right Scott burly again and</font>

336
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:17,380
actually along pretty much the same

337
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">lines I it if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is envisioned that will</font>

338
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,840
have a document for the addressing

339
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:26,080
architecture it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible that that</font>

340
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:29,139
might need to be developed before the RS

341
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,090
50 50 document and in any case I'm

342
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,530
volunteering to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one as well</font>

343
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,530
it's very important to me

344
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do you got it other any that aren't</font>

345
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:49,299
covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> nope yeah that editors for all</font>

346
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:51,069
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed well there is free of</font>

347
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:55,539
service in those fires I have a dress

348
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:59,799
already sir so marked volunteering yeah

349
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:01,269
so the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that nobody take on was</font>

350
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,079
the registry of service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fires</font>

351
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:07,779
which I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a dress that was</font>

352
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:15,899
with pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> advent so I could take this</font>

353
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:20,889
one any other so we I haven't earned any

354
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:26,408
people saying wrong or<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything and</font>

355
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:29,758
we've earned almost two editors or two

356
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:32,709
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> per document bury my son at least</font>

357
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:38,849
to be interested in working on them so

358
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:42,999
it looks well seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that we're</font>

359
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:48,279
pretty good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for is our EDF happy with</font>

360
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:50,469
this happier than last<font color="#E5E5E5"> working are you</font>

361
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:58,329
happy or if I if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put this on the</font>

362
00:21:50,469 --> 00:22:00,190
tracker will be okay Rick Tyler with a

363
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:02,349
sort of question for the for the room

364
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,349
and you know the remote participants

365
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:06,879
network management the intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

366
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:09,009
understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that we should discuss</font>

367
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:11,978
it with the ops area are people happy

368
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:13,449
with saying we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss that with the</font>

369
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:15,159
ops area and not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it in</font>

370
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:17,919
this cycle I know personally I am

371
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,469
because it's a massive topic but it

372
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,329
equally we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point I</font>

373
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:24,609
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see how the room feels</font>

374
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:26,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we just go ahead because it's at</font>

375
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:29,859
the bottom of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint yeah as I</font>

376
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:32,109
said in our me you know previous meeting

377
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,269
is that it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the network</font>

378
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:36,129
without network management being the you

379
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,649
know deployed doesn't make any sense so

380
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,869
i think that's that's a however we don't

381
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:46,418
you know kind of know how to approach it

382
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:47,619
there's some work already done so so so

383
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,140
i was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to elaborate a</font>

384
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:53,510
little bit

385
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:57,380
on our conversation that on first blush

386
00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:01,700
the the existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF model network</font>

387
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:05,120
management you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> IE SNMP or net comp</font>

388
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,490
yang doesn't seem to be quite a good

389
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,330
fitness but in order to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that</font>

390
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,470
point clear one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

391
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,270
had talked about was actually having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

392
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,440
discussion with in the ops theory to

393
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,540
make sure that we weren't missing

394
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,660
something obvious one of those things

395
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,620
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be applied so you know part of the</font>

396
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:26,270
reason why it's listed down here as a

397
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,919
question mark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discuss is because</font>

398
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,379
we need to have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion before</font>

399
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,640
we start jumping into trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

400
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:38,120
documents to cover that do we need a

401
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,330
document saying the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a position</font>

402
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">paper document saying look that work</font>

403
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,669
management for dtn is a tough topic that

404
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,770
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then take to the ops area as a</font>

405
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:53,870
position piece or can that just be done

406
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:56,270
in corridors I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make more</font>

407
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,679
work but I'm wondering whether by not

408
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,800
having something formal in the pipeline

409
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,660
and relying on chats with a DS and that

410
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,430
kind of thing whether things will get

411
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,660
dropped if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to i'm not</font>

412
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to volunteer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody do this but</font>

413
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know we developed the use cases on</font>

414
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiki</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would have no problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

415
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,270
having you know another entry on the

416
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,210
wiki that talks about the network

417
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,889
management considerations so that we

418
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,260
have something concrete to show to the

419
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">ops area is saying hey this is what</font>

420
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,930
we're looking at and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

421
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,210
like SNMP or<font color="#E5E5E5"> netcom is going to solve</font>

422
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:34,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for us you know please tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us that</font>

423
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,950
you know we're wrong and that it will

424
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,240
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> or help us understand what</font>

425
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,760
direction we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be moving in order</font>

426
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,240
to do it I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and keep it as</font>

427
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,240
lightweight as possible

428
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,580
just just to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that discussion</font>

429
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,830
there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's your name for</font>

430
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:03,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry had minute taker ed this</font>

431
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,639
is EDD at brain APL there there have

432
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">been there has been some work in that</font>

433
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,210
area to describe desirable properties

434
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:14,820
requirements unique constraints and and

435
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:19,169
the definition of network management at

436
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,520
levels in dpns so with working with

437
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone i'm happy to pull that</font>

438
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,750
information together put some

439
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">information that we already have up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

440
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,789
the wiki to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> that discussion i do</font>

441
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,110
think we're we're reasonably far long

442
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,600
and describing these what we think the

443
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:38,010
desirable properties for that would be

444
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:41,070
great this bob cole<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have a</font>

445
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,860
management comment so i have a different

446
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment or question so okay have you</font>

447
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,590
guys discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeframes through these</font>

448
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:52,020
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> or is it too early yeah the</font>

449
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:57,570
authors and we think that within a month

450
00:25:52,020 --> 00:26:00,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll be all done great no I'm seriously</font>

451
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:05,399
this is like give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty fifty a</font>

452
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:07,470
two-year effort out or so so I can't

453
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember if it was in our meeting or</font>

454
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,460
some actually I think of what it was our

455
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,899
meeting where I said if it was beyond 18

456
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,440
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to like pull my hair</font>

457
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,880
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's left of it so I'm</font>

458
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,880
actually hoping that we can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

459
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,020
quickly I'll leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the people who</font>

460
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,760
are writing the documents and

461
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,950
discussions within a working group to

462
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,460
see if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hit those kinds</font>

463
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:33,320
of time frames but and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

464
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:36,360
expect even if at the end there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

465
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,610
graph of dependencies dependencies

466
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,830
between documents we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work them</font>

467
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,229
in parallel and to converge at some

468
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,990
point that you know so we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not try</font>

469
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,360
to start with one and everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

470
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:51,120
waiting for the first one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish so</font>

471
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,580
even if we know they are dependencies we

472
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,469
can work in parallel so that could help

473
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:04,970
you know

474
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:10,789
finishing in this decade any other

475
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:13,250
comment Rick can't make up his mind I'm

476
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:16,309
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making noise now I'm Rick Taylor</font>

477
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:19,309
again did anyone put their hand up to

478
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:27,500
security because i know there's oh it

479
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:31,908
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'll go sit down again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

480
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,390
so with you know with my half of the hat

481
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">on I think the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go is for the</font>

482
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,710
people who volunteered to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

483
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know within the next week or</font>

484
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">two how long they think it would take to</font>

485
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:47,090
write such a document and maybe just

486
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:51,080
consider what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your dependencies would</font>

487
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:53,470
actually be and in that way if we have

488
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information and then mark and I can</font>

489
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,840
take a cut at a more global list of

490
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,129
deadlines that we can put into

491
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,149
milestones and then we can bring it back

492
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,890
to the working group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a</font>

493
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:11,409
quick discussion on the list about it

494
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:16,720
that were excellent

495
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:23,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay ed you want to talk about your</font>

496
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:25,220
security action I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

497
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,690
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so do you bring your laptop</font>

498
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,690
or the whole shebang murder

499
00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:01,210
so while it is preparing the only thing

500
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:05,140
if we we hear there's a clear consensus

501
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:08,170
and agreement on those the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only piece</font>

502
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,960
remaining that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need kind of a time</font>

503
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,300
frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the different documents and</font>

504
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,230
then we can input it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> de tracker</font>

505
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,750
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian was saying you know the out</font>

506
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> editor is the one that expressed</font>

507
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest as soon as you you know give us</font>

508
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:28,149
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on date and then we'll</font>

509
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it this site the the very last you</font>

510
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:40,240
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we're we need okay so I</font>

511
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,750
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little while about</font>

512
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,120
security models for DTM we have

513
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:49,540
something called the streamlined bundle

514
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,250
security protocol just as a point of

515
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,170
reference to help target the remainder

516
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,950
of the discussion who here has

517
00:29:53,170 --> 00:30:00,700
familiarity with RFC 6257<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bumble</font>

518
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,440
security protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's a</font>

519
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">little less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than half of the room so we</font>

520
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,180
have if you put an agenda slide up

521
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,770
everyone falls asleep but if you put the

522
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,040
agenda as part of the title everyone

523
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,510
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a great title look</font>

524
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,060
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of recommendations</font>

525
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,120
implementation status and what is there

526
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,040
to do using this particular view of

527
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,199
security and whether this particular

528
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:28,050
video security is the view that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

529
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:31,120
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adopt in the working group so a</font>

530
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,710
somewhat quite simplified<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture here</font>

531
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,620
which illustrates some of the use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

532
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:39,700
that were motivating to our example was

533
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,149
how do we work at a variety of layers to

534
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,479
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

535
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:46,939
in our individual model claves between

536
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:50,479
them understanding that security may be

537
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,700
different between enclaves at borders

538
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:56,619
and there may be obviously knows where

539
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:59,899
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any trust model whatsoever</font>

540
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:01,759
originally link layer security was how

541
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,768
we did this at the application layer we

542
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,330
need an end model because clearly when

543
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,629
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different classes of users</font>

544
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,968
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a system like this and we're</font>

545
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:13,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the individual links you have</font>

546
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:17,239
shared access to the links and you need

547
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:19,940
a higher level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fidelity additionally</font>

548
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:21,519
from endpoint services that cross

549
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,279
enclaves if you need authentication

550
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,349
confidential TN to<font color="#E5E5E5"> n you may apply those</font>

551
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,469
services somewhat differently in your

552
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:33,080
network meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that perhaps</font>

553
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:34,309
authentication or maybe just integrity

554
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,928
within your Enclave perhaps

555
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:39,408
confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and perhaps additional</font>

556
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:43,099
integrity between your<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience so in</font>

557
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:47,869
this model of how do we handle this at

558
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:49,549
the bundle liar so we came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set</font>

559
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:50,869
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> desirable properties i think i said</font>

560
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:52,219
desirable properties the network

561
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:56,629
management comments as well it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

562
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:59,119
favorite we wanted atomic services and

563
00:31:56,629 --> 00:32:00,769
this is again pulling off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

564
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,009
insights from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original bubble</font>

566
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,999
with it in some of its security

567
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:08,590
considerations as opposed to relying on

568
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,929
the other

569
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,209
link you can provide all the security

00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:16,870
and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the disruptive and delay</font>

571
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,700
and cute nature bundles it is best to

572
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,059
keep the security services with the

573
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,860
bundle itself and not as part of some

574

overarching encapsulating or supporting

575
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,719

576
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,610
authentication integrity and

577
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,919
confidentiality where we differentiate

578
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,229
authentication and integrity by saying

579
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication is single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop</font>

583
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:50,529
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take these atomic</font>

00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:58,720
observation made in BSP in the original

609
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,840
to the way that PSP work was it uses the

610
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,939
extension block mechanism to put the

611
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,889
security primitives into the bundle in

612
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,710
cells that security is carried with the

613
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,960
bundle and it described for a marble

614
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:14,570
authentication block or blocks which

615
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,570
served as a bundle<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop to bundle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hop</font>

616
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,690
basically oftentimes a sign checks up so

617
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,609
that you knew who the sender of the

618
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,950
bundle was you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity and</font>

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,940
some way with somehow applying security

627
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,040
multiple blocks for example bundle

628
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,290
authentication would typically have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

629
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,350
block at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning pre payload and</font>

630
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:51,179
also an additional block post payload so

631
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,250
that if you're processing large bundles

632
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,869
you can look at a header but not have to

633
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,300
worry about a remember result until you

634
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,580
get to the end for prostate perspective

635
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,160
and then separate from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font>

636
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure various cipher Suites could be</font>

637
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,000
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cipher text and</font>

638
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,100
parameters and populate those quads and

639
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,100
a graphical example of that is here

640
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,109
where you would have a bundle with a

641
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,650
primary block an extension block which

642
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:18,270
was a bath payload and then a cuddle at

643
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of the presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

645
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,359
integrity on the pay line so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

646
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,830
what we mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we say that bumbles</font>

647
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:27,540
would like to take their security with

648
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,710
them they're using the extension block

649
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,580
mechanisms to get the

650
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,080
secondary headers and trailers as we

651
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,839
implemented this there were a couple of

652
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,580
observations one was there is a concept

653
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:40,980
of a security source<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

654
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,290
destination for a block and the idea

655
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,380
that this was supporting in cascading

656
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,359
operations was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point in the</font>

657
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,490
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bundle you may get to a</font>

658
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,848
bundle agent that would say from this

659
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,950
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward you have to encrypt or</font>

660
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:57,869
from this point forward you have to

661
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,848
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity and when you get to</font>

662
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,609
another piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network you can</font>

663
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:05,220
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the simple case the</font>

664
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:07,348
initiating security operation happens at

665
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,660
the bundle source and in the simple case

666
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:13,230
it is removed at the bundle destination

667
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:17,299
but that that requirement was not there

668
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">at ESP so that he would have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> waypoint</font>

669
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the security source which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

670
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,580
from the bubble source and a security

671
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,440
destination which was separate from the

672
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,480
bundle destination and it was a

673
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,220
mechanism for trying to do a security

674
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,040
tunnel without creating a security

675
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,080
tunnel the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of that was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

676
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,150
he wanders in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path the likely path</font>

677
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,220
or at least the entry and ingress and

678
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,440
egress points of a bundle through some

679
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,390
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a network cloud you could apply</font>

680
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,670
that if you didn't or if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bumble</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">well-appointed security source and then</font>

682
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,490
singing a different path to the

683
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,440
destination without actually going

684
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the security destination you</font>

685
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,140
could find yourself in a bind where you

686
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,540
are unable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrypt or integrity sign</font>

687
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,118
part of your bundle and the larger

688
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:03,000
observation here was that there became a

689
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,070
coupling between security and routing in

690
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,260
this case and it became very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement that in all of</font>

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">bspa and we came up with five</font>

700

that was getting to was making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

701
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,759
as we had cascading operations as we

702
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,800
understood where blocks were being put

703
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,000
that we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create what we</font>

you did your fragmentation in a certain

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bsp document itself as the document</font>

to reduce the rules around whether

00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:08,469
found some additional loopholes to close

859
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:56,948
is no way in the block header itself to

00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,540
we would adopt that mechanism as opposed

ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle that i define them as</font>

restrictive and permissive

878
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:46,660
authentication restrictive is if I get

<font color="#CCCCCC">to a bundle agent and the bumble agent</font>

880
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,040

there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacation in the bundle what do</font>

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can set the if you cannot</font>

884
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,790
process this block leg do you drop the

885
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,680
block or do you drop the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bomb you need</font>

886
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,270
to do one of those two things because

887
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,890
you have a security service that is

888
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,300
meant to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hops aha but you've not gone</font>

889
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,920
one hump you bring something that

890
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,160
doesn't understand a security service as

891
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,510
a matter of policy you should be able to

892
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,700
either say something has gone terribly

893
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,040
wrong I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand the security</font>

894

topology of my network kill the whole

895
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,360
bundle and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to proceed</font>

cannot be authenticated a separate

898
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,540
policy is to say well authentication

899
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,580
just means we got here if I don't care

900
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,930
about security that well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

901
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,750
drop the block and continue processing

902
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,399
it and that is also something that is

903
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,770
defensible based on certain network

904
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,990
deployments and certain use cases so we

905
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:46,900
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need to handle each of</font>

906
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:50,919
those as a matter of policy I have a

00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">question come fall um so this is in</font>

908
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,850
little ways resembling source routing

909
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:58,169
source routing or strict source routing

910
00:45:54,850 --> 00:46:01,509
and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine another option being</font>

911
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,600
don't do anything don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop anything in</font>

912
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:06,400
particular forward it along the path

913
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,770
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get debate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics then</font>

914
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,320
about authentication for one hop<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

915
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:14,710
means but it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be a</font>

916
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:19,690
useful practical case that would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

917
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:20,740
from time to time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be well and</font>

918
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,980
that was at

919
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,470
the initial stance was that but my

920
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:29,350
definition security was hot too hot with

921
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the assumption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Sika was bundled no to</font>

923
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,600
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> was there but if and I were</font>

924
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,220
happily we didn't address what to do and

925
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,589
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with whether we had</font>

926
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:42,129
two options or three options with yours

927
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:45,040
being the third option to do nothing it

928
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:46,900
does violate the semantics of single

929
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,000
powerful communication in the bumble

930
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,530
topology now that doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't</font>

931
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,970
a data point of policy but that's

932
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably something we want to discuss</font>

933
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,390
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the broader the</font>

934
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:58,660
generalization of question is that

935
00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:00,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">single hop or is it some hop so while</font>

936
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,190
dedication separate from integrity was

937
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,250
meant to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> singlehop with integrity</font>

942
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,630
there has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been some discussion on</font>

943
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,240
fragmentation and its interaction with

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:32,109

off<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which you apply it</font>

00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">only like fix it the order in which you</font>

949
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:48,400
apply integrity and confidentiality may

950
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,410
matter are you allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to integrity sign</font>

951
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,940
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already been</font>

952
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:54,549
encrypted or encrypt something that has

953
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,380
already been integrity sign the reason

954
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,730
why that comes up is there are certain

955
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,240
cases if we go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial</font>

956
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,320
network deployment diagram where you may

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,339
typically if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want both you will</font>

958
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,660
typically apply

959
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,520
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will typically use a cipher</font>

960
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,259
suite that gives you both and gives you

961
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,780
an integrity as additional authenticated

962
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,380
data or something like that however if

963
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:16,360
your source says please only integrity

964
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,160
sign while you are within my Enclave and

965
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,470
then if you have a border gateway<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

966
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,819
is then applying additional encryption

967
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,919
because it is going outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

968
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,900
Enclave there are examples where the

969
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,370
source of a security block may be

970
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:31,150
different than the bundle source in

971
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:33,339
which case you need to understand when

972
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,620
and where you allow sources to be added

973
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,050
by other bottles and that is addressed

974
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec and a question came up on</font>

00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:05,160
together security compatibility profiles

more holistic how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">although these will of course be</font>

1019
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,989
positive what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do when less</font>

1024

00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:43,499
not mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you do what do you</font>

1027
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:48,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do in terms of evaluating security</font>

obviously the fragmentation and then

dropping the bubble or to your point in

1035
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:07,499

individual security policy is what we're

1038
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:17,460
considering a best practices document

1039
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:21,169
which talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how you achieve basic</font>

1040
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,969
security services using a variety of

configuration policy and protocol

1042
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:28,100

00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,029
the tunneling point came back<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

1045
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,890
always the answer but it sometimes and

1046
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question then is if you can identify</font>

authenticators and others as we are

1055
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,640
collecting them how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you</font>

1056
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,280
do them with the set of small non

1057
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,440
monolithic rfcs working together and

1058
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,000
that is a meta document if you will that

1059
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,760
can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to achieve these</font>

1060
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,040
services with what we have again the

00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:11,390
smaller distributed model being the goal

1062
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,640
that's what I have so where we are right

1063
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:15,680
now is we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> vivvy we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sbsb we</font>

1064
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,390
have initial implementations of those we

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,700
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some areas where we want</font>

1066
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:22,279
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something differently but we would</font>

1067
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:28,250
like we would request folks who review

1068
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:30,820
the specs and provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment sorry John</font>

1069
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">daddle Airbus and yeah pretty draft</font>

1070
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:38,270
great like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I feel the draft would</font>

1071
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:40,850
benefit from some explanation at the

1072
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:46,250
beginning as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> why this is better than</font>

1073
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BSP I might be there I might best it</font>

1074
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:52,130
but it's I know you spent several slides

1075
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:56,540
discussing the boys and where<font color="#CCCCCC"> falls and</font>

1076
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:59,330
whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we can't deprecated</font>

1077
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">vsp it's not not an ITF thing to do that</font>

1078
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:05,090
sort of thing but is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it is it ietf</font>

1079
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,650
practice to say actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd rather use</font>

1080
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,260
this one rather than this other one over

1081
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:12,020
here so that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting</font>

1082
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:14,300
question and very interesting especially

1083
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:18,020
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have an answer for it but</font>

1084
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:22,250
the the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that 6257 is an</font>

1085
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,810
experimental RFC out of the RG what what

1086
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,140
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1087
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:28,060
mean in terms of writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

1088
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:33,310
standard to accomplish a similar result

1089
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:34,840
in the WG it is listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> as reference but</font>

1090
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:37,330
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to call this a</font>

1091
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,220
streamlined on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security protocol do we</font>

1092
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,930
name it something else is there at the

1093
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,759
feeling that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is changing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1094
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,740
supplanting one or the other as we go

1095
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:48,030
forward so i would i would appreciate

1096
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:52,899
any education or insight into how they

1097
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:54,730
talk about that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming Kevin fall</font>

1098
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,580
again you said a different standard so

1099
00:53:54,730 --> 00:54:00,370
that was not a standard fair enough

1100
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:04,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so as an RG were not able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1101
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:06,990
that so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can make statements</font>

1102
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:09,280
though need to say this is

1103
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,620
recommendation and retire the other

1104
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,050
document if it's time to do that right

1105
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">so there's there's plenty of mechanism</font>

1106
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:26,710
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think bright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Haberman who</font>

1107
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:29,950
knows what I don't worry so in the ITF

1108
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:32,650
we have any number of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say do</font>

1109
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:35,620
this instead of that we can write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font>

1110
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:41,470
that says we prefer this way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1111
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:48,160
x y&z fine the more useful way of doing

1112
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:51,189
it is to write this as a as a mandatory

1113
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,109
to implement specification so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1114
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do security this is the way you</font>

1115
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:57,280
do the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ignore what's over</font>

1116
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,560
there I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to do</font>

1117
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,340
anything with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security spec</font>

1118
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:07,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> came out of the research group we</font>

1119
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:08,440
just as a working group say from a you

1120
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,960
know from from our engineering

1121
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:15,820
perspective this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1122
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:18,690
do it so fair enough so whatever

1123
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,690
whatever the

1124
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:26,490
hey Rick Taylor a bus I'm assuming your

1125
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,170
intention is to keep this draft going

1126
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,348
through a few more iterations as it

1127
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:36,810
tracks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 50 base so it doesn't it</font>

1128
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:40,490
make sense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bsp is for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 50 v1 and</font>

1129
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:43,380
this can pretty much be the security

1130
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:46,049
protocol for 50 50 base and then then

1131
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,599
there isn't really an issue there now

1132
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gave you couldn't praise that</font>

1133
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">will naturally deprecated each other</font>

1134
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,339
correctly well<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of what I want</font>

1135
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:55,770
maybe what I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expanded on a</font>

1136
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:57,660
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit is when we when we write the</font>

updated it won't fit right process wise

1141
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,359
we would as working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group we need to</font>

1142
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,579
first laughter my stones and also agree

1143

that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right document to start</font>

1144

with us as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security protocol so we</font>

1145
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:25,609
need to get consensus that this is the
