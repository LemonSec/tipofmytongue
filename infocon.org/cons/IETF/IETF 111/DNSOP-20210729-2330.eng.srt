1
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,960
all right it looks like it's 30 minutes

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,279
after the hour

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,480
so i this is tim and i figure we can get

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,960
started

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,720
because we're all looking forward to

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
this part of it um welcome to the second

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,480
session of dinasopp

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,800
um

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,680
tim benno and suzanne you both heard

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,280
them on the audio

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,480
for a few minutes ago um

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
paul's taking minutes again the jab room

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,160
is

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
tied into meat echo which is actually

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,280
very nice

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
in many ways um the notewell

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,800
for you folks that haven't seen it yet

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
by this time of the week

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,359
please read it

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,360
or if you have any questions just ask

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
one of the chairs or ads

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
so yeah they're gonna shift the order

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
around a little bit

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,640
um and we can discuss this if people

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,280
have any

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
objections to it or anything like that

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
or do a little new business first

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,000
um schumann wants a few minutes to talk

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,119
about this

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
uh his new draft um and i know that sort

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
of raised some questions this afternoon

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
so if folks have any sort of bashing to

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
do on that please speak up

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,960
speak up now um then what we're going to

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
do is um we've got a liaison reply to

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
the

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
iso statement on private use tlds

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
suzanne's going to present that

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,079
and some proposed next steps um

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,399
they'll do those sort of in a combined

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
fashion

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
and then we'll break down and talk about

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,079
some of the prioritization of the

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,520
working group activities

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,719
including a discussion um as to what's

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,920
going on

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
as that so um

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
so saying that we can um

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
with with nothing to say

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
um we'll just jump in this um schumann

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
um

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
schumann you can just unmute yourself

53
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
and stick yourself on video you

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
have to wait okay was that to me

55
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
uh paul thanks okay so um

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
uh i know there's some concern about

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,760
taking time away from the work

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
prioritization discussion so i'm gonna

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
be very quick

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,519
uh i'm discussing a new draft that

61
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,319
describes

62
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,200
an enhancement to the so-called black

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,280
lies authenticated denial of existence

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
mechanism

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
i'm using the term that's widely known

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
to describe this method but i want to

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,519
focus today

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
on the technical content of the draft

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,480
folks can propose other names afterwards

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
so please let's not do that right now

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,680
please and

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
next slide please let me start by

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,360
quickly

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
describing the mechanism for those who

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
aren't aware of it it's documented

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,959
in an expired internet draft from 2016

77
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,120
and as far as i'm aware

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
has never been proposed to be published

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
as an rfc in any category

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
however it is becoming widely deployed

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
amongst the online signers there are now

82
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,400
three major commercial dns vendors that

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,159
use it use it

84
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,720
cloudflare of course the originator ns1

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,360
and more recently amazon route 53

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
and what it does is effectively

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
eliminate the concept of

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,000
nx domain which as it turns out has some

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,440
implications next slide please

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
so for a name that doesn't exist which

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
would normally elicit an

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,239
nx domain response it pretends that it

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,120
does exist

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
but doesn't have any data associated

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,519
with the type you queried for

96
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
that's to say it returns a no data

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
response so status code no error with an

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
empty answer section

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,798
and the rationale is twofold you have

100
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,440
more

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,478
compact answers a signed

102
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,600
no data requires just one an nsec record

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
and its corresponding rrsig

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
and better performance you just have to

105
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,280
do one online signing operation

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
for the nsx signature and by contrast

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
a typical annex domain response requires

108
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
up to two nsec records

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,960
and if you use nsac3 up to three nsec3

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,560
records and they're associated

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
signatures so that's

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,560
larger responses and more computation to

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
produce those responses

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
next slide please uh so

115
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,759
what operational implications does this

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,880
scheme have

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,919
for normal end user applications

118
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,320
probably nothing the effect of a no data

119
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
response is treated

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
identically to an nx domain in almost

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
all cases

122
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
however there are a variety of

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,039
diagnostic tools

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
traffic characterization tools etc that

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
may need changes to effectively deal

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
with this

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,960
rather strange protocol obviously the

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
first example that comes to mind is

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
things that plot our code distribution

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
of dns traffic many people do that so

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,759
they'll see

132
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,600
almost everything is no error from these

133
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
signers since our code 3 just doesn't

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
exist here

135
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360
and to give another example from my day

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,840
job

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
we have dns record provisioning tools

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
that need to precisely determine nx

139
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,720
domain

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,440
they have critical safety features that

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
prevent you from say

142
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
creating a zone cut or installing a d

143
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,960
name

144
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
at a name that does exist to prevent

145
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
accidentally

146
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,120
occluding everything at or below that

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,919
name

148
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,759
and lack of this safety features

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
actually cause production dns outages

150
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,639
for us

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
and we need this stuff to work so

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
arguably the r code

153
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
should not be used for these types of

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
checks because as we all know it's

155
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,199
unauthenticated and could be spoofed but

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,440
then what we need to do is to

157
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
infer non-existence by looking deeper

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
into the payload of the dns response

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
specifically at the signed insect

160
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
records and figure out whether

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
this is sufficient or not to detect

162
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,919
non-existence so next slide please

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
and the answer is almost here's what an

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
nx domain response looks like from this

165
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
protocol so i'm querying a name that i

166
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,680
know

167
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,919
not to exist nxd.blah etc

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,000
and you can see the response code is no

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,319
error not nx domain so

170
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,080
how might we infer that this name

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
actually doesn't exist well the obvious

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
way is to look at the type bitmap

173
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
in the nsec record and see if it has any

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
data record types associated with it and

175
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
we can see here here that it only has

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,120
the nsx metadata rrsig

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
and nsec but is that good enough next

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,400
slide please

179
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
not really because if we query an

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
empty non-terminal name which positively

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,520
does exist as in this example we get

182
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
an identical response the we get exactly

183
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,759
the same type bitmap

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,280
as you can see the bottom right next

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
slide please

186
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,280
so there's no way to distinguish nx

187
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,599
domain from mt non-terminals in the spec

188
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,960
as originally written our proposal then

189
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,599
is that these implementations and only

190
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
these implementations add a new

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
synthetic rr type

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
to the nsec type bitmap to signal the

193
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,199
presence of an ent

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,599
and that will immediately allow you to

195
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,039
you know precisely differentiate

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
nx domain from this case of non-annex

197
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,759
domain

198
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,599
so this is deployed in the field already

199
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
by one commercial dns vendor

200
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
and i'd like to acknowledge yamchalak

201
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
who i work with to make that happen

202
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
and i'm also speaking with a second

203
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
vendor about implementing this next

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
slide please

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
and to make it more concrete here's a

206
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
real example of this enhancement in

207
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,639
action i query

208
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,280
the mt non-terminal that i have here

209
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
cleverly named ent1.sftcsd.net

210
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
and as you can see we have this

211
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,840
additional synthetic r type in the type

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,720
bitmap

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,479
currently we're using a number from the

214
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,280
private use or our type range

215
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
we could and probably should ask for an

216
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
official allocation from ayanna

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
next slide please and if you're

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,080
interested

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,799
i have some simple sample code here to

220
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,279
infer

221
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,640
nx domain from the bl type

222
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,040
bitmap and next

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
and lastly what should we do next so

224
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,800
whether the itf dns up crowd likes it or

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
not the bl mechanism

226
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
is deployed in the field today and

227
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
potentially will be widely used because

228
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,320
as i mentioned there are three big dns

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
vendors doing it

230
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,360
so it seems to me that it deserves to

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
have a stable published reference not

232
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,920
just an expired id

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
we did inquire with the originator maybe

234
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
a year or two about their

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
draft and didn't hear back the ent

236
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
enhancement that i just described is

237
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
also deployed in the field

238
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,200
and should have a published reference

239
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
for that same reason

240
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
now due to the fact that this protocol

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
contorts the semantics of annex domain

242
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,320
egregiously one might say i suspect that

243
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,360
the dns

244
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
crowd will not bless this approach but

245
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
maybe i'm going to be surprised

246
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
so i was thinking informational rfcs via

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320
the independent stream could be the most

248
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,640
fruitful course of action to pursue and

249
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
we could even combine the original

250
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
protocol description into my new draft

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and then we just have one

252
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
document to publish so what else we

253
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,959
could let this draft expire as well

254
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,839
and call it a day and with that i will

255
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
stop

256
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,720
go ahead victor support

257
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,279
uh either informational or standards

258
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
track this looks like a good idea

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,200
okay okay these are those are two

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
radically different

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,079
things though right but okay thanks

262
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,160
victor

263
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,800
yeah peter hello i know i argued against

264
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
bullet point 2 earlier today on the list

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
but then i found myself arguing 4 bullet

266
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
points 1 on the chat just now

267
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
so i guess i stand behind bullets point

268
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
for a document that describes

269
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,440
although all of these things that are

270
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
happening because it is important for

271
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
any developer to know that these are

272
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
happening and

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
i i'm as a resolver vendor that it is

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,160
important to understand

275
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
what is happening in the black lives

276
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
area so we don't

277
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,920
pollute our insect aggressive catch with

278
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,600
those

279
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
so i like four i have no uh

280
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
no opinion on point three because

281
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
process is

282
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800
unclear to me okay great yeah thanks

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
peter so i think i

284
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,959
agree generally i mean one of the

285
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
problems i've had is uh when i talked to

286
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
savvy dns engineers in my company

287
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,480
they're uh

288
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,440
often surprised by this behavior of uh

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,720
you know the vendors that do these

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
tricks and then i have to explain what

291
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
it is

292
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
and then uh i have no like stable

293
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,920
documentation for uh

294
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
to point them to right to even describe

295
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
what's going on

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,279
yeah there's a cloudflare blog post from

297
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
years ago that isn't

298
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,279
quite good but doesn't describe exactly

299
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:51,920
what

300
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
everybody else is doing and there's the

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
additional confusion that when you query

302
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,200
without

303
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
the dns okay bits that cloudflare does

304
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
actually return an x domain

305
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
so many things about it are confusing so

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
i do agree that some stable reference

307
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
would be very good to have okay great

308
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,560
thank you

309
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,518
peter joe

310
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,480
uh we i can't hear you here you go oh no

311
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
oh no i can oh now i can oh good okay

312
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
good no idea why that is

313
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,519
anyway um i don't think it's actually

314
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,720
very important whether we think this is

315
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,079
a good idea i think it's far more

316
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
important that it's being used and it's

317
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
confusing

318
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
and i think a document is good i think

319
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,399
the working group should take this on

320
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
although i hesitate to say that because

321
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
i know the working group's already got a

322
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
lot of documents they're struggling to

323
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,680
make progress on but

324
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,360
um i do agree that it should be

325
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
published just because it's being used

326
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
it's deployed in the wild

327
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,680
and it's nice to have a reference when

328
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
people are confused

329
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
okay thank you

330
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
paul

331
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
i don't know if paul is talking because

332
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
i can't hear him

333
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,160
hello hello hello yes sorry about that

334
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,079
um i agree with the previous two

335
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,680
speakers that we should do this we

336
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,959
should do this in a working group

337
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,519
um since it's mostly documenting

338
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,440
existing practice it shouldn't be

339
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
too slow to go through the working group

340
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
because we're really just

341
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,680
writing what's already there um i would

342
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,959
request that we

343
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
not call it black lies and come up with

344
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,079
a different name

345
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
sure so we are going to do that and i

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,959
think uh

347
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,160
joe you're going to come up with an

348
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
alternative name for me

349
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
but we'll work on that

350
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,399
okay so i'm gonna relay something that

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,839
was just uh

352
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,639
sent to me um and it looks like

353
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,000
cloudflare is on

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,880
board with uh renaming and helping to

355
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,519
publish

356
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,639
so that's that's good

357
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,639
uh we're closing the queue

358
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
donald

359
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
just wanted to say that as the author of

360
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,519
the indiana considerations rfc that

361
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
since this needs special handling

362
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,279
uh it requires the standards action to

363
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,160
assign an rr type for this purpose

364
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,800
it cannot be handled as an unknown rr i

365
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
don't think

366
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
maybe my opinion

367
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
okay uh thank you donald

368
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
we'll have to figure that out i guess

369
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,839
joe are you in the queue again or no

370
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
brian brian uh sorry i'm

371
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,720
i guess when i was reading the uh the

372
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,440
draft

373
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
it wasn't clear to me and then going

374
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
back and looking at some of the related

375
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,360
items

376
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,040
uh whether this is also being done

377
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
by these providers for insect 3 or if

378
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
it's only insect

379
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
because i think insect 3 has a slightly

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
different uh

381
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
behavior in terms of how it treats ents

382
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
and that was what

383
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,440
originally caused me to post the list uh

384
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,839
right yeah

385
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,120
so uh so my understanding is that

386
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
this mechanism only use enzyme uh

387
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,560
insect epsilon functions and sector is

388
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
more complicated it requires more

389
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,839
records so they chose not to do that

390
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,160
okay

391
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
okay that's all i have yeah i can just

392
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,639
address that

393
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
last point very quickly there's no

394
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
benefit for using nsec3

395
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
uh this already hides this already

396
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
prevents his own enumeration

397
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,639
um so there's no real there'd be no

398
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,839
reason to apply

399
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,440
anzac uh three um i just wanted to push

400
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
back against the idea that we're just

401
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
going to document an existing protocol

402
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,920
or some part of dns if we're going to

403
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
adopt this as a working group item then

404
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,199
it needs to be a proper working group

405
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
item and we should be allowed to change

406
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,839
it or improve it

407
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
i don't expect many changes because it

408
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,360
is in production it does seem to work

409
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
we use it at ns1 as you as you pointed

410
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,480
out um

411
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
but i don't want to end up with

412
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
something like um

413
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
edna's client subnet where it was sort

414
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,800
of like uh well

415
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
just adopt what it is and we'll fix it

416
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
up later in another version which will

417
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
never happen so that's uh that's my

418
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
feeling about that

419
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,920
okay thanks shane

420
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,839
right thank you folks

421
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,600
yeah thank you shimon

422
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
ah let me move the window around and i

423
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,720
guess i'm next

424
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,280
great everybody's favorite um

425
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,799
just to set the stage um this is the

426
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
this is going to be a very process

427
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
oriented update

428
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
on the situation that we have around

429
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,480
this draft

430
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,599
the chairs have because it's a process

431
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
heavy kind of kind of activity the

432
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
chairs do have a specific role

433
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
and we've been working with our area

434
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
directors and with wes

435
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
as a member of the iab to keep the

436
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,200
process on track

437
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
but the working group will have to

438
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
decide what we'll do with the situation

439
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
we have so i'm going to go through the

440
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,559
the process pieces first and lists

441
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,880
where we are with with various options

442
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
for how to proceed because no decisions

443
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
have been made and no decision can be

444
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
made without the working group

445
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
um as far as what to do with the

446
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,840
information we have

447
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,679
um the editors

448
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,559
of the private use tld document have

449
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,280
some comments to make on

450
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,480
how we might proceed and we wanted the

451
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
chairs wanted to see how people feel

452
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,039
about where we are

453
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,200
but this is largely a process and sort

454
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
of informational update

455
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,280
and we will proceed we will continue

456
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
to discuss the implications next slide

457
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
please

458
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
very brief history um the private ucld

459
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,400
draft introduced

460
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,200
late in 20 2019 adopted middle of last

461
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,600
year

462
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,880
in the midst of a in the timeless covid

463
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,919
time

464
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
um the basic idea we had discussed

465
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
before i believe in dnsap

466
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
to acknowledge the use of quote private

467
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,520
tlds which is

468
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,559
a terrible term as you know

469
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,360
most of us most of us are familiar um

470
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
outside of the public dns

471
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
and the idea was to minimize damage of

472
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,960
these uses of the public dns outside of

473
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
the public dns by indicating

474
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,520
strings that seem safe to use for this

475
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
kind of purpose

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
the draft proposes to add around 40 of

477
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,799
user assigned alpha 2

478
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,640
codes to the special use names registry

479
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,559
and that's where the process comes in

480
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
because iso 3166 is maintained

481
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
by another standards development

482
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,840
organization beside iso

483
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,760
tc46 and dennis out

484
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
sought guidance on whether the user

485
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
assigned list was stable and otherwise

486
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
suitable for this use

487
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
the iab administers liaison

488
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
relationships on behalf of the ietf

489
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,760
including to isotc46 and

490
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,120
the iab composed an appropriate question

491
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,919
in a liaison request and the liaison

492
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
manager was asked to follow up

493
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
and there's a reference here for the

494
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,039
where that that's online

495
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,960
the liaison manager has offered written

496
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
advice to the working group including

497
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
an assessment of why we should not

498
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
expect a formal response and why we

499
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
shouldn't use the proposed strings as

500
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,120
private tlds

501
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
now this is a communication to the

502
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
chairs we get to decide what

503
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
we make of it next please

504
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,120
again no decision has been made on how

505
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
to proceed but

506
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
and we do have to consider where we are

507
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,480
at the moment

508
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
unknown what alternatives we might have

509
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
to accepting the advice

510
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
john clenson was liaison manager that

511
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
handled the communication

512
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
we forwarded his letter to the mailing

513
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,200
list in particular the reason given

514
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
in his analysis for why there isn't more

515
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,080
of an answer from iso tcp 46

516
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,360
sounds structural not circumstantial or

517
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
procedural

518
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
i want to emphasize at this point that

519
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
this kind of communication is

520
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,840
well within the prerogatives of any

521
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,120
standards development organization

522
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
regarding a standard they maintain

523
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,679
including as john described the itf

524
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,640
itself

525
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
just for example the iutf has no way to

526
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
answer such a question besides

527
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
publishing a new rfc

528
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
and also realistically it's very

529
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
difficult to assure anyone that anything

530
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,400
in the digital world is guaranteed to be

531
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
stable

532
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,158
for 50 or 100 years next please

533
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
so the implications of the advice we've

534
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,400
gotten if we take it at face value

535
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
as unlikely as it might be to change we

536
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,679
can't depend on these strings to remain

537
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,880
user assigned forever the lack of a

538
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,600
clear answer itself promotes uncertainty

539
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,799
particularly if we're talking about a

540
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,400
standard track rfc and iana actions

541
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,919
reserving the strings in the special use

542
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,440
names registry may be

543
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
unproductive for the iso ietf

544
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
relationship which does affect more than

545
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,240
danisop

546
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
at face value this implies we should

547
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,919
look elsewhere for strings to reserve

548
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,919
for the private tld purpose

549
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,840
next please so we have options

550
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,480
possible ways forward for the draft we

551
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,559
can proceed with it is currently written

552
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
we can rewrite it in a couple of

553
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,919
different ways

554
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,559
to reserve different strings formally in

555
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,640
the special use names registry

556
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,559
or to provide procedural advice to

557
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,520
people with this engineering problem of

558
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
strings to use in a private dns context

559
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,600
but not recommending specific strings

560
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
we can abandon the draft and figure will

561
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,000
revive it if and when

562
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
acceptable strings can be agreed on or

563
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
the question can be safely avoided

564
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,760
there's a lot of ways to to approach

565
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
that um

566
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
the working group could ask the chairs

567
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,600
to come up with a way to get further

568
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,159
advice

569
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,640
which would almost certainly which would

570
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,919
necessarily involve

571
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,200
our area directors or the iab or both

572
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,039
um your option here we're looking for if

573
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
other if people see additional options

574
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
that they feel strongly about we would

575
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,440
like to hear that

576
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,559
but we also wanted to make sure that the

577
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,320
current editors of the document had

578
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,799
a few minutes to make their suggestion

579
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,880
on how we might want to move forward

580
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,880
so i think joe ably is next

581
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,840
as one of the editors of the document so

582
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,559
i'll let joe

583
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,840
take it away take it away

584
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,280
thanks susan can you hear me just

585
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
checking yep yep all right good

586
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
all right so um we threw these slides

587
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
together very quickly earlier today

588
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,440
without having the benefit of looking at

589
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
your slides suzanne that you just

590
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,559
repeated has just presented so i'm going

591
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,240
to suggest

592
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
in the interest of not repeating

593
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
anything the original slides are all

594
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,159
there and the materials people can see

595
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,440
them but can we just skip to the very

596
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
last slide which has moving on in the

597
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
top

598
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,880
that'll save some time i don't want to

599
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
repeat all the stuff that suzanne just

600
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:38,960
said

601
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
so this is what we came up with

602
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,559
the the authors the editors of this

603
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,840
draft this is the working group's draft

604
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
it's not our draft

605
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
the editors of this of this draft

606
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,400
already had

607
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
different possible futures in mind and i

608
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,720
think we mentioned on the main list that

609
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
like we didn't all agree with each other

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
about the best way we were kind of

611
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
listening to guidance

612
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
um and what we discovered on the path to

613
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,080
that is that

614
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,120
this is a tangled mess of policy and

615
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
standards bodies

616
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,360
and governments it's just a bit of a

617
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,159
nightmare

618
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,600
and it's probably fair to say it's more

619
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,120
of a nightmare than we anticipated when

620
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,159
we started

621
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,200
doing what we thought was a very

622
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,799
sensible thing so what we suggest

623
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,000
is that there's some good work in this

624
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
document there's some useful stuff to

625
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
write down we know that there are some

626
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,799
people using these particular two

627
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,559
character code points

628
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,120
in private networks so what we suggest

629
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
is that we recognize

630
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,360
that the existing recognize the current

631
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,919
state

632
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,400
of the advice we don't recommend

633
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
anything we don't put anything in any

634
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
iowa registry we don't reserve any of

635
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
these names

636
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,960
we don't promote any kind of best

637
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,400
current practice or

638
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
even worse current practice what we do

639
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,559
instead is we describe

640
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,000
why people have decided some people have

641
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
decided to do this

642
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
document the potential future pitfalls

643
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
the fact we cannot predict the future

644
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
these things are not guaranteed to be

645
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
stable

646
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
and we just empower people to make their

647
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
own decisions so

648
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
we think this is a reasonable way to

649
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
avoid bogging ourselves down

650
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,640
impossibly you know an intractable

651
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,799
never-ending policy mess

652
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,320
but still give some advice that

653
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,840
represents some of the thinking around

654
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,720
this

655
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,240
and make sure that you know the the

656
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
conversations we've had which you know

657
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,039
and are not all thrown away

658
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,480
and pointless we actually write some of

659
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
it down but i mean just repeat

660
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
the idea is not to recommend anything

661
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,000
not to specify

662
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
what these code points should be used to

663
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
it's simply to document how some people

664
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,559
have interpreted the current

665
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,760
standards and and and

666
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,279
acknowledged that things may change in

667
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,440
the future so that that's all i got

668
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,799
for this happy to take questions

669
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,440
victor is the goal only to capture the

670
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
things that are already in use

671
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
or to potentially find things that are

672
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
safe to use

673
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,919
because i have thoughts on the finding

674
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,760
things that are safe to use but if we're

675
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,080
not

676
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,640
looking to recommend new code points but

677
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,159
only capture

678
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,200
existing dubious practices

679
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,880
then i don't have anything to add

680
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,360
so which are we trying to do i think

681
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,640
we're trying to capture existing

682
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,400
practices i think we're going to avoid

683
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,000
casting aspersions as to whether they're

684
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
dubious or not we're just going to

685
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,520
try and relay the thinking that led to

686
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
people just making those decisions

687
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,000
and whilst at the same time highlighting

688
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
that these decisions are not perfect

689
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,880
and people should be right so right

690
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
right because in the world of you know

691
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,520
ace prefixes x and dash dash

692
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
we could introduce some new prefix

693
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
prefixes

694
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,840
that are completely collisionless

695
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,760
i think that's right

696
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,029

697
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,400
i'm not sure what who said what

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,000
oh many of my microphones stopped

working again no you're

700
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
you're fine you're fine okay but there's

701
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,760
an outcome

702
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
okay well i'll mute when i'm not talking

703
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
but yeah the idea is to document what we

704
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,080
have

705
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,320
there are lots of ideas possible ideas

706
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
about this

707
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,399
the xn-type analog is one of them s-sac

708
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,000
produced a document which which

709
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
recommended the i can board do a thing

710
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
the ccns may have opinions about things

711
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,559
there's all kinds of people who could

712
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,919
have opinions around this

713
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,200
i think we're not trying to close any

714
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
doors we're just trying to document one

715
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,640
set of decisions that some people have

716
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,360
made without recommending anything

go ahead wes yeah sorry i muted myself

again go ahead wes

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,840
uh so bear with me for a minute um so

722
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,399
this is a really

723
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
really cool hack and i i loved the

724
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,919
ingenuity of it you know from the

725
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,399
beginning

726
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
um it was it was a clever way to get out

727
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,919
of the problem that we've been in for a

728
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,120
while

729
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,720
but when i really stepped back and

730
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080
talked to a lot of people in the past

731
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,039
couple of months

732
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,240
as my role in iab and not and my role as

733
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,039
liaison

734
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,440
coordinator for the iab and not um i

735
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
realize that it's important to consider

736
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
a couple of vantage points right

737
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,080
so we have the advantage point from dns

738
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,760
op we've always had this issue of you

739
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,480
know we want

740
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,240
private organizations with a label or a

741
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
set of labels that they can use for

742
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
internal communications or you know

743
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,320
whatever else

744
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,600
and this has been desired for a long

745
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,039
time and we've you know failed to

746
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,679
provide it

747
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,440
and so there's even disagreement about

748
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,799
whether there's a need in the first

749
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,159
place

750
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,640
if we consider iso's advantage point

751
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
right they've they've created this space

752
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,039
they

753
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,159
they were assigned uh the the uh the

754
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,760
responsibility of administering the

755
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,640
two-letter tlds you know for user space

756
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,679
um what is a user in this context right

757
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
in iso's vantage point what is a user

758
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,000
and

759
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,760
and after reading documentation and

760
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
stuff the user is supposed to be

761
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
countries that don't have an assignment

762
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
yet for themselves

763
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
and this is sort of important if you

764
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,360
know countries split or you know new

765
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
countries get created

766
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
that does still happen occasionally and

767
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,000
eventually they're not yet recognized

768
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,840
and it takes that process takes a while

769
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,960
so they can take one of these

770
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,799
user-defined spaces

771
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
if we turned around and changed the

772
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,480
notion of what a user is from our

773
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,159
perspective we're adding potential

774
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,640
conflicts to that intended use

775
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,559
if organizations inside a country had

776
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
been using it for example then there

777
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
amounts to similar conflicts as we

778
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
already have with corporate mail and we

779
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,880
know how much of a pain that the whole

780
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,799
situation is

781
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,880
from you know the iso vantage point you

782
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
know it's functionally their code space

783
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
given to them a long time ago

784
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,399
in history that i actually don't know

785
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,320
which is between the ietf and icann and

786
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,039
iso

787
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,320
that i can't summarize here because i

788
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,399
actually don't have it in my head

789
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,080
but consider what it looks like if we

790
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,679
functionally publish a document

791
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,240
that takes it back or even publishes a

792
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,360
document that says

793
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,559
you know we don't know whether this is

794
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,399
good or not to use and that's really

795
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,840
what i'm going to come down to because i

796
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,279
i don't think it's actually

797
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,320
okay to even to you know this ends up

798
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
to me being i should not or must not uh

799
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,840
because it's not

800
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
necessarily appropriate it's politically

801
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
inappropriate to consider this

802
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,960
that's not where i started i started

803
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,799
with this is a really cool hack

804
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,559
let's take one more step forward which

805
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,159
is the ietf vantage point

806
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
right what happens if we set this

807
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,919
precedence to reuse

808
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
other organizations private spaces would

809
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,880
it be okay for iso to define how

810
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
private asn spaces should be used for

811
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,480
routing and what impact would that have

812
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,159
on existing operations

813
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,480
what about another sdo that redefines

814
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,760
the purpose of the evil bit because

815
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,960
clearly we're never going to use it for

816
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,080
reals

817
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
what about an sdo that redefines the use

818
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,840
of the z bit in dns because it's

819
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
historic and we no longer clearly need

820
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,039
it because we you know

821
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,440
aren't really using it what about an sdo

822
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
that defines how

823
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,559
1918 space could be used in some sort of

824
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,039
novel way what if iso

825
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,720
actually revoked you know portions of

826
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
our oid tree because they didn't think

827
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,760
that we were using it

828
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,480
right i think that we'd be furious from

829
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
the ietf perspective if some

830
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
organization did something similar and

831
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,039
in the end

832
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,399
to me this is a we we should not do this

833
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,880
or we must not do this because we have

834
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,480
to agree between multiple standards

835
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,760
organizations

836
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,399
uh to have consensus and and just beyond

837
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,080
consensus unanimous

838
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
consensus in order you know for

839
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,760
interoperability not to be broken

840
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,080
between organizations

841
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,399
thank you

842
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,279
hopefully it seems to be a delay

843
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,159
sometimes am i working again

844
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,000
yes testing testing looking now

845
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
yep yeah brian isn't it brian isn't it i

846
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,679
don't know what the delay is we just

847
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,679
respond briefly to where's

848
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,320
the history of the intersection between

849
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
these two letter code points

850
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,679
and how they're used as tlds is not

851
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,120
quite as as wes

852
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,480
pointed out i mean we don't need to go

853
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
into the history here but it but it's

854
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,679
it's not quite as as

855
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,760
indicated but i want to confirm that the

856
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
suggested approach here is definitively

857
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,519
not for the ietf

858
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,519
to promote anything or to suggest that

859
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,440
anybody do anything merely document that

860
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,760
some

861
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
people have used their interpretation of

862
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,679
the standard in a particular way in

863
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,039
their private network where they have

864
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,000
jurisdiction

865
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
and how they organize their dns so again

866
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
it's not the ietf exerting

867
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
a particular use it's really just

868
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
documenting what somebody did i

869
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,640
i realized whereas you may well think

870
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,399
that that's a sort of a way of a weasley

871
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,120
way

872
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,960
of addressing the entire thing but i i

873
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,159
do think there's some benefit in

874
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,279
actually documenting what people are

875
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,799
doing here and i don't know where else

876
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,200
to do it

877
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,650
brian

878
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,779
[Music]

879
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,120
i think everybody's ever said um sorry

880
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,799
that's also kind of easy i think it

881
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,640
would be helpful or useful

882
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,399
if we could document it

883
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,559
and then vaguely deprecate it

884
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,399
if we have something that we can offer

885
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,919
as an alternative

886
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,720
and i think if we do pick an alternative

887
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,760
something

888
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,080
underneath iepf control such as under

889
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,519
dot arpa

890
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,679
might be a good place for something like

891
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,200
that

892
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,480
and then the question bad ideas

893
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,840
suggested might be

894
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,880
previously possibly is having

895
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,000
something like a an unsigned delegation

896
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,919
to md.as112.rpa just to make sure that

897
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,880
if it leaks

898
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,000
if any of these uses get leaked uh they

899
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,080
don't really go anywhere useful

900
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,360
anyway those are your thoughts

901
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,840
thanks brian i i definitely appreciate

902
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
the leap into engineering but i mean i

903
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,399
think just just be

904
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,000
be confident that there is no there are

905
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,080
no shortage of ideas about how to do

906
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,559
this

907
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,760
from the technical perspective we're

908
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
really i think at this point talking

909
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,760
about

910
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,039
whether we should do anything not

911
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,679
exactly how we should do anything

912
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,840
uh one so warren and

913
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,279
wearing no hats um so i think that if we

914
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,960
were to document the fact that

915
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,519
people do things like this we should be

916
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,399
very careful

917
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,080
that we do think mention things like you

918
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
know people do this for

919
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,519
home and dot corp and dot mail and a

920
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
whole bunch of other strings that we

921
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
know about

922
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
i'm concerned that if we specifically

923
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,159
point at

924
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,199
these iso 3166 codes

925
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,560
it's gonna come across as hey look

926
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
some set of people do this isn't that

927
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,119
interesting nudge nudge wink wink

928
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,119
um and it would be very hard sort of

929
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,320
not have that be heard as

930
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
you know we found what could be viewed

931
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,239
as a loophole in some set of specs

932
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,839
that's interesting we're not going to

933
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,520
say use it we're not going to say not

934
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,879
but hey ain't that interesting um

935
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,040
obviously name collisions and people

936
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,918
squatting on names

937
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,599
is a massive issue and i think everybody

938
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,960
agrees that

939
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,879
um having more discussion that might be

940
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,560
useful i'm just not sure that

941
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,760
mentioning the set of labels

942
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,200
is going to end well for us

943
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,000
yeah we're going to give wes the last

944
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,040
word and then take it to the list

945
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
okay all right go ahead joe you have

946
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,000
something to say in the west

947
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,680
no i was just going to agree with warren

948
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,960
it would if we did publish something

949
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,359
here and

950
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,640
it's a perfectly reasonable option to

951
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
say this doesn't have a home where we

952
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,359
should drop it and i think

953
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,720
if that's what the working group prefers

954
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
that's what we'll do and uh

955
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,480
i do think if we do publish something

956
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,839
it's very going to be very important to

957
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,040
make it very clear that there are

958
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,400
problems with all these approaches none

959
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,079
of these things are sanctioned

960
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,920
the ietf is not expressing any kind of

961
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
authority all we're doing is documenting

962
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,839
some decisions some people have made

963
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,520
and it has trade-offs same as everything

964
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,440
else so i do agree the wording will be

965
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,320
very careful

966
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,400
important uh so you're right that

967
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,760
that uh it is you would be talking

968
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,119
documenting something that already

969
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
existed however by actually producing

970
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,800
the document in the first place i

971
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,520
actually looked

972
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
went back to uh four years worth of

973
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
queries on

974
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,680
just one sample day out of uh digital

975
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
data

976
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
about the number of queries for dot zed

977
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
that arrived at

978
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,400
you see usc isis root service it

979
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
quadrupled and almost quintupled between

980
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
the point that that draft was published

981
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,440
and now

982
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,280
so we already have had an effect

983
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
unfortunately

984
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,880
but the guidance of this document that

985
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,079
we might want to produce

986
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
should define everything that we learned

987
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,440
and then explain advice

988
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,359
about why people shouldn't be doing what

989
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,040
we've learned right so you're right you

990
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
know people are doing it

991
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
but they shouldn't and that's what we

992
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,119
should document stop it

993
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,680
well i think publishing it as an idea

994
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,599
considered harmful is certainly an idea

995
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,960
too so i guess we'll take it to the list

996
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,160
and uh thanks suzanne

997
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,470
and next next thing i guess

998
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,440
[Music]

999
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,480
yeah yes thank you joe and yeah

1000
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,280
i think the the the next the next item

1001
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,720
is the the last thing and

1002
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
it's um we had gone to the working group

1003
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,839
a

1004
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,839
couple weeks ago and we're we're our

1005
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,480
trying to get a handle on priorities

1006
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,680
among the

1007
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,640
working working groups workload and tim

1008
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,280
is going to

1009
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,440
lead that so go ahead tim thanks okay

1010
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
thanks um yeah

1011
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,880
um and thanks for benno for putting some

1012
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,800
of these together this is very good

1013
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,079
um going through the list of documents

1014
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,040
we have

1015
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,839
um when this first came up i was sort of

1016
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:16,320
like

1017
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,359
i didn't think we had that many

1018
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,960
documents and then i looked i said oh

1019
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,839
maybe we do

1020
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,520
and then i looked and i realized like oh

1021
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,839
http biz has just as many as we do so

1022
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,680
we're not as horrible as like the next

1023
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
group of people um

1024
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,440
i don't know if that means anything but

1025
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,359
in the data tracker as you can see

1026
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,079
we've got 17 documents really 12 when

1027
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,839
you sort of toss out the ones that are

1028
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,720
basically

1029
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,920
in the process or being held um i think

1030
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
the held one is the all tld document

1031
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,100
which we won't talk about right now um

1032
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,200
[Music]

1033
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
so in an idea to sort of manage

1034
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,800
prioritize what's going on

1035
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
we were looking at some documents that

1036
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,560
are close or ready to work in group last

1037
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:52,960
call

1038
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,280
you know basically the low hanging fruit

1039
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,800
and then what does the working group

1040
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,839
think about this

1041
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,920
and we when we were talking about this

1042
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,040
with warren we sort of

1043
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
threw out this half-baked idea of like

1044
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,880
maybe we should do a poll and worms like

1045
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
that's a great idea you should do a poll

1046
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,720
and um and so there we are

1047
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,839
um so look for all the other

1048
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,160
warren um working groups that have polls

1049
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,839
that got going out

1050
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,160
as well um we'll see um

1051
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,240
so looking at some of this this is some

1052
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
of the um

1053
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,839
where we sort of saw some of the you

1054
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,680
know feedback from folks

1055
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,440
where where there was some as we sort of

1056
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,599
said on monday was that monday when we

1057
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,359
had our first meet oh yes it was

1058
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,960
um some you know a lot of positive stuff

1059
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,480
on the insect three guidance draft the

1060
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
glue is not optional

1061
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,400
and it's revalidation um some

1062
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,119
interesting

1063
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,400
you know push back on um a lot of

1064
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,280
indifference to

1065
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,760
stuff like 5933 biz and the in

1066
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,720
consideration

1067
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,240
catalog zones um

1068
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,520
comments like that um not important

1069
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,560
um delegation only sort of got the

1070
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
the largest negative response um sorry

1071
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,160
paul

1072
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,480
um the other paul not that paul that

1073
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,440
paul um

1074
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,280
you know which paul it is um but yeah

1075
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,480
that seems to be

1076
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,320
really where the group was sort of it

1077
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,760
was sort of good to get sort of this

1078
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,640
feedback

1079
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
in a very anonymous way so people didn't

1080
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,560
feel like they were

1081
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
going to be judged in any way shape or

1082
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,320
form um

1083
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,400
would you like to say something mr paul

1084
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
they also probably revealed that on my

1085
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,240
um

1086
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,560
my submission too um the questions are a

1087
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
little weird like like the

1088
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,079
the delegation only draft for instance

1089
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,920
just takes 15 minutes for people to

1090
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,480
finally

1091
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,400
decide to kill this idea or accept this

1092
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,079
idea like it doesn't take much working

1093
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,359
group time exactly

1094
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,680
exactly and exactly and so telling

1095
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
people whether it's important to know

1096
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,640
that i'm putting it to the back of the

1097
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,320
list all the time it's what has already

1098
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
been done to this document for like two

1099
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,800
years

1100
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,160
so i don't think the the methods of

1101
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
trying to clear our queue is is a proper

1102
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,359
method because

1103
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,760
there will always become more important

1104
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,880
things than the

1105
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,359
less important items we have and so you

1106
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,720
will always get them on the android

1107
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,560
chain and they will just linger for

1108
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,720
years without getting resolvement either

1109
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,839
one way or the other

1110
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
and that's the real problem that no

1111
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,319
actually that's a very good point and

1112
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:18,960
and

1113
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
i think some of what we're going to take

1114
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,920
from some of this is not just things to

1115
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
move forward but things to

1116
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,560
to basically say goodbye to right um

1117
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,359
and and you're absolutely correct um

1118
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,040
that that's a good way to say it

1119
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,200
and um and yes it won't take that long

1120
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,240
okay warren

1121
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,040
you may thank you and yeah i mean i

1122
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,000
think

1123
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,560
some of this is also people who've said

1124
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,800
that a specific document is important

1125
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
i think we're hoping that that also

1126
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
means and they're willing to spend some

1127
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,640
time on reviewing it really soon and

1128
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,720
providing comments as well

1129
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
right so some of this isn't just which

1130
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,480
is important but it's also

1131
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,240
a implicit and i'm willing to actually

1132
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
spend the time to do a useful review

1133
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,760
as soon as it comes up for working group

1134
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,160
last call

1135
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,359
another part was also to help get people

1136
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,960
thinking about the set of drafts for the

1137
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,760
conversation

1138
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
but i don't really know why i'm talking

1139
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,960
now so i'll just stop okay

1140
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,800
thank you um and much like we discussed

1141
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,240
on monday we feel we have

1142
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,000
a few graphs that are pretty close to

1143
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,359
working group last call

1144
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,720
um i the ionic consideration

1145
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,119
this is this is not interesting but it's

1146
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,400
basically

1147
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,319
plumbing that we have to do that i feel

1148
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,520
we have to do as a working group and i

1149
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,000
think the chair

1150
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,160
is all sort of an agreement on that and

1151
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,119
so we'll

1152
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,200
move that forward i a lot of good

1153
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,880
discussion on the glue is unoptional now

1154
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
that it's been revived

1155
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,480
and um as well as the avoid

1156
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,920
fragmentation we really want to sort of

1157
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,839
move that along

1158
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,480
though there was some good discussion on

1159
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,079
monday about some of that

1160
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,319
um i need to sort of we need to follow

1161
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,119
up on

1162
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,560
same thing with insect three guidance

1163
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,040
are very you know it

1164
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
it looks like some straightforward

1165
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,400
measurements

1166
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
to get to settle on some maximization

1167
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,920
count and um

1168
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,040
we feel that the draft is ready to go to

1169
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,400
move forward as well

1170
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
um as long as the authors sort of feel

1171
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,680
similarly

1172
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
um which we think they do

1173
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,839
so there's a few things that sort of

1174
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,800
came up

1175
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,079
um that we consider are pretty close as

1176
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,800
well

1177
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,920
the error reporting um needs a little

1178
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,280
bit more discussion

1179
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,599
um and some sort of this you know some

1180
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,400
prototypes

1181
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,440
but ns revalidation we feel um and i

1182
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,880
know i've sort of poked the authors on

1183
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,160
this a few times

1184
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,319
um we really think it's pretty pretty

1185
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,400
close to working group last call okay

1186
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,280
schumann

1187
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,319
as one of the authors uh yeah so i was

1188
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,040
gonna say

1189
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,920
um it's mostly done there are a few uh

1190
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,560
small edits that were in the queue

1191
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
so what happened with that was we kind

1192
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,720
of got derailed a bit and lost momentum

1193
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,079
when one of our co-authors ralph belmans

1194
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:00,880
left for

1195
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,079
a green pasture by which i mean non-dns

1196
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
passions he completely left the dns

1197
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,920
political engineering community

1198
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,480
so um we're going to pick that up i just

1199
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,079
have to um

1200
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,760
ping uh paul that is paul vixxie and uh

1201
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,640
finish up some of those edits and then

1202
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,079
hopefully we can get that review

1203
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,720
yes i i did not poke you this time

1204
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,599
because you had been

1205
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,960
you guys have been working you folks

1206
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,119
been working on the the glue is not

1207
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:27,680
optional

1208
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,000
draft and um i didn't want to sort of

1209
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
get you

1210
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,119
mixed up with that so but thank you okay

1211
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,720
yeah thanks yeah

1212
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,680
victor timing on the n63 in terms of

1213
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,000
timing and insecurity recommendations

1214
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,319
i'm waiting for a few shoes to drop

1215
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,280
trans ip

1216
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
has some bulk changes that they're

1217
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,319
implementing

1218
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,839
and a few others and we'll have a much

1219
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,359
clearer picture

1220
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,280
of what the deployment landscape looks

1221
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,240
like about a month or two out

1222
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,560
so i don't know if that's you know

1223
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,920
within the kind of time frame you're

1224
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,599
thinking ready for

1225
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,720
school or not but i think that's close

1226
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,720
yep okay yeah yeah but not today

1227
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
but before but before the next ietf we

1228
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,240
should be able to yes

1229
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,480
yeah things should be clearer by then

1230
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,520
yes yep

1231
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,359
perfect that's exactly how i sort of

1232
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,119
view close

1233
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,000
um really close would be you know like i

1234
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,359
am in consideration that'll probably go

1235
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,480
off this week

1236
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,760
um as soon as i sort of get moving on

1237
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,319
stuff

1238
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,560
um some other interest you know there's

1239
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,480
sort of mixed interest in some of these

1240
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,200
um we do want to move the 84.99 biz

1241
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,000
because there's some

1242
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
updates in that um some some new

1243
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,480
terminology especially on the

1244
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,000
dot dom h bits um and maybe some more

1245
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,760
after the deprived discussion

1246
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,680
on some of the dennis over quick and

1247
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,040
some of the variations i

1248
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,640
i will have to talk to the authors on

1249
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,160
that um

1250
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,319
but some of the new work being suggested

1251
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,480
in the in sort of the free form field

1252
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,680
the dns bootstrapping um which we saw

1253
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,000
you know as well as the dnsec automation

1254
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,280
um we saw that

1255
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,800
you know we saw both drafts kind of come

1256
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,240
through the mailing list and they looked

1257
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,280
interesting

1258
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,400
um and we were sort of

1259
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,560
you know we're thinking that yes these

1260
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,240
may you know these sort of fall into the

1261
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,680
sort of same bits

1262
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,240
um that we feel very good about sort of

1263
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,960
adopting

1264
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
but we held off because of you know we

1265
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,240
wanted to make sure we sort of got our

1266
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,440
handle on

1267
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,640
what we were doing um

1268
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,640
but and i think the dynasty

1269
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,839
bootstrapping it got

1270
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,480
a fair bit of good comments about sort

1271
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,839
of being adopted so

1272
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,200
i think that's something the authors we

1273
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,000
should talk to the authors about um

1274
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,200
sort of bringing up discussion on the

1275
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,240
mailing list as well um

1276
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,480
so thanks for that as you know we've

1277
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,760
held off tld and that's not going to go

1278
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,280
anywhere um and we've sort of held back

1279
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,400
on sort of

1280
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,560
you know we we had we had folks present

1281
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,599
stuff that

1282
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,119
wasn't what we considered current

1283
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,640
business or even new business

1284
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
because we like doing that in dynastop

1285
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
we like giving folks sort of that

1286
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,640
place to sort of you know throw out all

1287
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,000
their sort of ideas

1288
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
and sort of get the feedback um it

1289
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,280
didn't mean we're gonna adopt stuff or

1290
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,640
sort of put it in the queue

1291
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,920
um but you know we want to get the cue a

1292
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,040
little bit more cleaned up or a little

1293
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,079
more organized

1294
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,200
so uh paul

1295
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,839
explain why all tld is going nowhere it

1296
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,319
was held by the working group there's

1297
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,160
you know in the last draft we saw a lot

1298
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,839
of interest why is it going nowhere

1299
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,520
i'm going to let suzanne talk about that

1300
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,319
because i'm no expert on the alt tld bit

1301
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,400
sorry suzanne um

1302
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,720
yeah not um there's not a lot to say we

1303
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,599
had

1304
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,240
parked it

1305
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,880
pending man i'd have to look at i would

1306
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
i would actually have to go

1307
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,359
look at it here yeah warren probably

1308
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,200
remembers better than i do but we had

1309
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,400
held it

1310
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,680
pending resolution of some some external

1311
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,480
condition and warren if you if you

1312
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,720
remember you should speak up

1313
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,079
i believe that we held it based on the

1314
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,920
finishing the special use domain names

1315
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,160
problem statement document

1316
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,400
and then an assumption that after we

1317
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,920
finish special use names problem

1318
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,440
statement we would actually get around

1319
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,240
to fixing

1320
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,160
all the problems with special use domain

1321
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,359
names

1322
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,839
um it was always the plan that you know

1323
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,440
there would be the problem statement

1324
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,599
and then the resolution document and i

1325
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,640
think we have

1326
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,440
never actually found people with enough

1327
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,720
stomach to take on

1328
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,160
the solution to special use names

1329
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,160
um yeah there was some hope that we

1330
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,440
would come up with a more general

1331
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,640
framework for

1332
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,960
moving at the time we had a large number

1333
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,280
of requests for special use names

1334
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,960
and there was i mean i'll point out that

1335
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,040
i am an author and i still think it's a

1336
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,319
really great idea

1337
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,119
we could always say you know it's

1338
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,760
unlikely that we will ever

1339
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,400
solve the problem of special use names

1340
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:04,960
so

1341
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,079
let's possibly go ahead with this but

1342
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,000
i'm biased obviously and that's the

1343
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,520
chairs decision

1344
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,559
um i will mention it did have

1345
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,319
a working group last call to which we

1346
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,480
invited i can people who all came along

1347
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,520
and

1348
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,839
i think were partly terrified by us but

1349
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,880
they nodded sagely

1350
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,960
yeah go ahead paul

1351
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,160
don't say things like that um i

1352
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,920
i know you were sort of joking but

1353
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,440
that's not at all a good

1354
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760
a good representation of what happened

1355
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,839
um icann folks came and said

1356
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,359
you know what if the ietf wants

1357
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,119
something we'll make it happen

1358
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,240
that's really different

1359
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,119
you're right i was overly flippant as as

1360
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,400
i want to do apologies

1361
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,160
thanks well um a good comment that came

1362
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,720
out of the

1363
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,960
the the chat was basically we should go

1364
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,480
talk to a lot of the authors and figure

1365
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,040
out

1366
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,920
what's going on with stuff um which yes

1367
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,480
we do

1368
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,599
we tend to do that um

1369
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,440
you before an itf we usually start

1370
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,040
contacting all the authors of documents

1371
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,319
and poking them about the status and

1372
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,520
where they are

1373
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
um and where we think

1374
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,520
you know where we think things should be

1375
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,440
and a lot of that we do

1376
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,880
you know sort of in the background and

1377
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,559
so maybe it's not as transparent and one

1378
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,200
thing

1379
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,640
that i've been really thinking about a

1380
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,640
lot and i think benno and suzanne have

1381
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,200
been is

1382
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,640
trying to figure out how to be more

1383
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,559
transparent to the working group as to

1384
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,720
how we make our decisions and basically

1385
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,559
our sort of workflow

1386
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,800
um because we do think about this stuff

1387
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
we have a bi-weekly chairs call

1388
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,960
um where we sort of go over a bunch of

1389
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,800
this and try to figure try to prioritize

1390
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,400
what we think is happening

1391
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,520
um and

1392
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
we do it basically a little

1393
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,559
independently of the working group which

1394
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:01,280
i think

1395
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,839
now that i realize is perhaps not the

1396
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,040
best way to do it

1397
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,800
um and so um it'd be great to get

1398
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,160
some solid feedback you know we're

1399
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,760
getting some solid feedback from the

1400
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,680
from the poll and from folks

1401
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,960
um and yes we want to

1402
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,680
sort of put we don't you know we want to

1403
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,880
basically start

1404
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
moving more stuff along and or not

1405
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,960
moving stuff along in mr water's case

1406
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,800
and and he's absolutely correct

1407
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,520
in some of this um i think sometimes we

1408
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,880
push stuff down

1409
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,480
thinking that eventually it'll go away

1410
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,240
but really the answer is we need to you

1411
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,280
know

1412
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,720
make those decisions in the working

1413
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,520
group and we're just the chairs are

1414
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,359
you know i'm just as guilty of of

1415
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,880
letting those slide and

1416
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,599
um thinking about the bigger issues i'm

1417
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,800
moving stuff forward

1418
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:55,839
um so oh brian you want to say something

1419
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,359
the i think there is interest um could

1420
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,480
we do a show of hands

1421
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,040
is that something we can do in this

1422
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,520
format

1423
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,839
a show of hands for

1424
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:23,839
i missed with the first part of the yeah

1425
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,520
okay uh cheers uh how do you feel about

1426
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,800
doing the show of hands

1427
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,000
and if so let's do a show of hands

1428
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,480
i'm sorry a show of hands on what i

1429
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,520
guess that was the question

1430
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,280
getting it back out of the health and

1431
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,839
making it move forward

1432
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,800
so yeah sorry i'm i'm i'm missing part

1433
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,359
part of it that dropped that um benno

1434
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,480
suzanne

1435
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,880
any suggestion i'm missing something

1436
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,400
there

1437
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,520
i don't understand no it's it's no brian

1438
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,040
not great so i'm not sure what he was

1439
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,280
requesting a show of hands on

1440
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,200
um in any case we are running a little

1441
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,960
bit short on

1442
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,960
time um

1443
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,000
and oh they requested

1444
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,680
oh sorry the request is whether all tld

1445
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,440
should move forward now

1446
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,160
that um um

1447
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,480
since it's been parked for a while and

1448
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,000
it's not clear that people have had much

1449
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,680
of a chance to renew their memories on

1450
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,240
it

1451
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,760
i think it would be better to take that

1452
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,599
to the list

1453
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,880
tell people we're interested in

1454
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,200
assessing that and give them a chance to

1455
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,640
reread it

1456
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,720
yeah yeah so this session is really

1457
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,160
about

1458
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,480
making progress in general and not about

1459
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,839
specific uh

1460
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,200
uh drafts uh so it's more approach how

1461
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,599
to

1462
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,720
improve well progress

1463
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,040
and and manage workload and transparency

1464
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,640
in our workflow yeah

1465
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,319
yeah um and indeed all the individual

1466
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,680
drafts have to be discussed uh maybe uh

1467
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,040
as schumann mentioned some authors have

1468
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,480
have a new career and outside the dns

1469
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,559
so maybe some of these documents need an

1470
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,680
additional new

1471
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,880
author this kind of things and and

1472
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,520
the chairs will think about it and get

1473
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,319
in dialogue

1474
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,599
with the authors if either

1475
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,800
there's another author needed

1476
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,920
on a document what's necessary and

1477
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,160
also for the old tld we need to think

1478
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,599
about uh

1479
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,240
what to do is that do we need to go to

1480
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,000
the mailing list

1481
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,920
or talk with the authors uh indeed

1482
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,119
well we had just had this discussion

1483
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,119
uh what's blocking the document and how

1484
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,559
we can

1485
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,280
get around that

1486
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:10,960
and one thing we sort of thought about

1487
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,440
was having a meeting every so often in

1488
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,520
between ietf's where we

1489
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,359
you know authors come in or anybody can

1490
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,599
come in and sort of you know

1491
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,440
we talk about sort of document status

1492
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,960
and and mostly you know

1493
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,200
how to move things forward not so much

1494
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,559
discussing the

1495
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,760
the innards of documents but you know

1496
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,839
where are we how are we moving you know

1497
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,760
how are we doing that kind of thing

1498
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,359
we're always looking for sort of

1499
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,119
feedback on how to improve our process

1500
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,119
basically because we do get a lot of

1501
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,880
folks kind of coming in with stuff

1502
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,880
and we see a lot of documents and

1503
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,480
there's some like the bootstrapping

1504
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,680
document which we think is very

1505
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,880
interesting but

1506
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,160
um sort of got missed in the shuffle um

1507
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,799
that i think you know really sort of fit

1508
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:53,440
into the

1509
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,880
the dinosaur world uh so we're always

1510
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,599
looking for that

1511
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,359
and i i hope we're

1512
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,839
we're responsive to any any issues or

1513
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,559
you know people

1514
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,480
people want to raise and you know you

1515
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,000
just go talk to warren if you've got

1516
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,880
issues

1517
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,440
um he's very willing to listen and and

1518
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,440
bring things to us and and sort of yell

1519
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,520
at us about stuff

1520
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,640
i think

1521
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,920
people should feel free to yell at us

1522
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,520
first yes yeah

1523
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,160
and in general i did want to say um i

1524
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,440
suggested in the chat

1525
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,760
just asking people if um it seemed

1526
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,880
useful to them

1527
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,280
for us to do like what the iab and i

1528
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,280
think the iasg have been doing the last

1529
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,839
couple of years where instead of having

1530
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:40,480
an

1531
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,520
agenda item for a lengthy or detailed

1532
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,880
report

1533
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,079
we publish a status report to the list

1534
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,240
before a meeting and then we have time

1535
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,240
for questions or comments

1536
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,720
yes um we won't have to go through it

1537
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,160
let's have we just have time in the

1538
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,799
meeting for

1539
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,880
for people to uh bring up specific items

1540
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,920
and that seemed to get some good

1541
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,160
reaction so guys we should think about

1542
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,799
that

1543
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,880
i think it'd be a good idea yes agreed

1544
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,640
go ahead paul so one suggestion i have

1545
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,880
is to maybe monthly or so

1546
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,720
just send an email with the list of

1547
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,079
items that we are working

1548
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,240
on items that we need feedback on so

1549
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,000
that everybody is reminded very

1550
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,760
regularly about what items we are

1551
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,640
talking about

1552
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,799
and then we have a much better situation

1553
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,000
where we can declare

1554
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,119
lack of interest and other things to to

1555
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,440
to to then kill those documents that

1556
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,799
have no interest or

1557
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,960
say this document seems to never be able

1558
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
to reach consensus we're killing it

1559
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,680
therefore then

1560
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,160
then we have something i think the the

1561
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,280
three times a year

1562
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,960
list of documents is just not good

1563
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,480
enough to get through this

1564
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,559
no i agree and actually that's funny

1565
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,720
because we keep a document status list

1566
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,760
in github

1567
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,440
and i've always thought about mailing it

1568
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,520
out regularly and it's kind of where we

1569
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,200
think documents are you know it's like

1570
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,640
this is being you know we're waiting for

1571
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,319
an author to get back to us on something

1572
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,960
and so you're you're right we we

1573
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,400
actually keep something very similar to

1574
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,359
that already

1575
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,520
we should push that to the mailing list

1576
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,640
on a regular basis

1577
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,280
that that's a very good point and

1578
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,920
actually

1579
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,040
i would agree totally with that so

1580
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,640
okay so we should take that as a action

1581
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,839
item as well

1582
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,839
um

1583
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,359
no thank you for that yeah we are almost

1584
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,640
out of time

1585
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,960
but um this this has been tremendously

1586
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,760
useful

1587
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,359
thanks everybody um and we have

1588
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,520
time for one or two final comments if

1589
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,599
anybody has anything additional today

1590
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,680
or we can give you back three three

1591
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,000

cute okay sorry i hate to be that guy uh

1595
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,400
at dprive

1596
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,240
um there was some stuff i was suggesting

1597
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,880
that i wanted to bring over to dnsof

1598
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,640
um specifically to deal with uh

1599
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,839
the fact that um delegations are

1600
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,680
unsigned um and i was wondering is that

1601
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,920
should i just write that up and post

1602
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,799
list and

1603
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,079
ask for feedback okay yes

1604
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,920
yeah okay just want to make sure it was

1605
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,119
cool thanks

1606
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,280
all right oh it looks like ben is going

1607
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,319
to get the last word in

1608
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,400
okay so i would i would appreciate from

1609
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,200
the chairs

1610
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,040
um a little more guidance about where

1611
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,559
documents like that should go

1612
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,280
um between dns and op and deprive

1613
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,200
basically if the nsop is overloaded

1614
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,799
you know tell us so we can have that

1615
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,200
conversation with depressed

1616
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,839
yep we can do that

1617
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,960
and i'll talk really quickly kind of

1618
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,720
like an echo um

1619
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,880
we had spoken about having a joint

1620
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,319
meeting between

1621
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,880
the pride and dns up and add and a bunch

1622
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,559
of others where specifically we could

1623
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,839
talk about that sort of stuff

1624
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,559
we should probably try and organize that

1625
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,839
an intro

1626
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:32,480
yeah yep

1627
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,960
cool all right then i'm going to let go

1628
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,680
