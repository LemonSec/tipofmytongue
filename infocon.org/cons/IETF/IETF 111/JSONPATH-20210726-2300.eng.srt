1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,440
hmm

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,920
was it what's the session that is

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,320
causing

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
participation problems

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
well um one of our editors has a has a

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
conflict

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
we expect glenn is already here the

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,519
second is here

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,279
the third has never actually been to an

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,439
ietf meeting before and

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,800
is having trouble with registration

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,880
issues um

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
okay so he's been functioning he's been

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
doing great stuff as an editor but

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,360
he may not join us the real truth is

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,320
that the

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,559
the working group is very heavily

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,200
eurocentric

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,239
um i i think i am perhaps oh

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
myself and and greg i think are the only

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
regular participants who are actually

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
in uh north american time

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
i see you but let's let's give it a

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,120
couple of minutes

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
um so in two or three minutes i'll ask

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,479
james james has agreed to go ahead and

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
do the opening ceremonies and we will

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,080
see if we can manage to have some useful

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
discussion if not

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,600
it has already been suggested that we

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,759
that we schedule another interim in a

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,439
more euro friendly time zone in the near

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,479
future

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:27,840
okay sounds good

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
just to get started with this

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520

i'll keep this brief this is the note

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,319
well uh we're one of the first sessions

45
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,480
so you might not be familiar with this

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
please know well this is an ietf meeting

47
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,599
so the

48
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,239
uh rules and procedures the ietf apply

49
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,280
to this

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
uh if you have any questions you can uh

51
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,560
pester myself

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,360
or even francesca who's hiding in the

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
chat

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
um

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,120
first things first uh

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,440
are we going to elect anybody to

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
uh do notes

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
i guess if we're going to not i i guess

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,800
there's

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
not much here i guess how about this is

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
there any agenda bashing that people

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,840
want to bring up

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
so james as usual i will take notes and

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,799
and email them to you and you know with

65
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,159
that in our recordings

66
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,440
we've historically gotten along pretty

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
well yep

68
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
yep and we're all looking at and i'm

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
looking out on jabba the blue sheets are

70
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,120
automatic

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
and if we don't have any agenda bashing

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
we can just quickly cut through what

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
we plan to be on the agenda

74
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
i i i guess that means we're good

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,480
so really the four issues that we've got

76
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,040
here

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
today is uh regular expressions work

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,439
uh determination of the descendant

79
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,319
selector uh

80
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,680
bracket notation which is both 92 and 93

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,280
and uh 110 which is portion predicates

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,040
tim how do you want to play this

83
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,160
okay i'm going to say that um in the

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,478
absence of two of our three editors

85
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,720
and also a couple of our other most

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
energetic

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
contributors uh greg has a business as a

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
work conflict he can't get out of

89
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,520
um i am not really inclined

90
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,479
to go ahead with this at this point um

91
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,680
because you know the people who are

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
closest to these issues

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
aren't here um this is unfortunate i'm

94
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,080
you know i'm okay i'll be frank i'm a

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
little upset this has been

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
scheduled for months and months and if

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,520
people weren't going to come they could

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
have said so but they didn't but here we

99
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,400
are anyhow

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
um so having said that

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
um is there anybody who's on the call

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,160
who would like to raise who has

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,360
something who

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
would like to raise um a discussion

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,199
around

106
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,120
any of these issues or has something

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
else they need to bring to the

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
attention of the jason path working

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
group

110
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,880
all right glenn go ahead um yeah just a

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
point of order really i think greg

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
expressed the fact he wasn't able to

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
attend very early on when he heard the

114
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
the meeting time oh really okay i my

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
apologies to greg cam

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
okay not hearing any voices i am

117
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
inclined to declare defeat

118
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,000
um and we will as already suggested by

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,840
multiple people proceed to schedule an

120
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,039
interim meeting

121
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,680
um in the near future and do so at a

122
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,080
more

123
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
euro-friendly time um

124
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,880
uh tim should we set perhaps a couple of

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,479
windows now

126
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,560
in terms of what sort of dates would be

127
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
appropriate

128
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,080
uh at least for ourselves and for those

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
in attendance

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
good idea let's do that so right now

131
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,639
we're coming up

132
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,080
we're in the late stages of july

133
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
yep so a sensible time to do this would

134
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
be in the first half of august

135
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,039
so that would be during the weeks of

136
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,560
uh monday august 2nd or

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,400
monday august 9th does that sound

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
reasonable or should we

139
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,720
perhaps a little early also consider

140
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
that a lot of europeans will be

141
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,560
on uh summer vacation in the month of

142
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,039
august uh i would propose actually

143
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,160
putting it out later in august

144
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
but i'd like to hear if anybody else has

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,679
thoughts

146
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
or we could just slide it to say the

147
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
second week in september everybody's

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
everybody's sort of back in in

149
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
a regular rhythm by that point in time

150
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,199
okay

151
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
glenn did you want to say anything i

152
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
shouldn't say i couldn't make the

153
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
last week in august okay

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,039
so i suggest we look at the week of

155
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
monday september 13th does that uh

156
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
yeah okay we'll we'll put it if we put

157
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,479
it to the mailing list and get and

158
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,000
solicit feedback then we can

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
use the if we've got a date to start

160
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,560
with that'll work

161
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
fair enough okay so for those of you i

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,599
just want to say a couple of words for

163
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,880
those of you who are here who are just

164
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
you know interested in jason path and

165
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
haven't been part of the party

166
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,720
um if you go find our our github repo

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
which is really easy to find

168
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,759
um our editors have been doing a really

169
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,360
great job of having a

170
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360

182
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
also uh some links there to some useful

183
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,919
resources incredible

184
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
including an incredibly useful

185
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
comparison of all the known json path

186
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,360
implementations and where they agree

187
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,360
and disagree um so

188
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160

uniform but not bad the

193
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
the the draft has been moving forward

194
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
and i think we will have an excellent

195
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,719
chance of producing

196
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
a json path the rfc that will be uh

197
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
super useful to the community so

large majority of our users are

227
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720

228
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
are are more apt to be available uh when

229
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,240
