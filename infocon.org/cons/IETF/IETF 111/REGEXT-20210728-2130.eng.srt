53

up as we go along here

103
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
on the point about document management

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
just a reminder

105
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
we have in general adopted a

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,080
guideline that other working groups in

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
the ietf use

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
where we really do want a document

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
shepard to

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
come on board with a document when we

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
take a document on

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
we do i currently have one document on

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,440
our docket which

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
does not have a document shepard at the

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
moment um

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,199
but uh you know we don't normally do

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
that we really are trying to

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
uh to help facilitate our own processes

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,040
here

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
and you know getting people to volunteer

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,639
to do that is a helpful thing

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,120
at least it ensures we have another

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
engaged participant to help move our

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
documents along

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
so please do remember and volunteer to

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,400
do that

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
a good way to you know get an

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
introduction to the process

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
too if you're a new participant here in

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
through all that

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
okay uh moving on let's talk about

135
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,000
published works we're actually a pretty

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
good working group because at least

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,320
lately

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
but between the last couple of meetings

139
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
um we've had quite a bit of

140

documents quite a number of documents

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919

142
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
time we had quite a number that

143

so that's a good success story on our

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
side

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,039
moving along in our agenda let's take a

175
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,360
quick look at other documents which

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
are in the publication process registry

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
maintenance notifications uh that's an

178
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,199
epp

179
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,960
extension is out there with uh the isg

180
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
it's currently an aed evaluation

181
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,039
and uh mary you jumped in the cube

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
please go ahead

183
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,400
just an update i had like requested last

184
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
call on that one the outstanding updates

185
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,800
are

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
they can be counted as last call

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
feedback so that should be on its way

188
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
all right excellent excellent thank you

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
that's good to know uh

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,560
we've had that document around for a bit

191
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,599
and then there's

192
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,960
um the secure authorization information

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,759
uh document um it's currently an isg

194
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,639
evaluation

195
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,800
there was maybe one concern for the

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,720
working group to consider

197
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
um but uh it was

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
um uh benjamin uh caduc who

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
had he'd actually withdrew his question

200
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,360
so the document can move along

201
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
but uh we did think it was appropriate

202
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
to see if there was anyone who wanted to

203
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
say anything more about this

204
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
uh particular issue he was raising a

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,479
question

206
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,000
uh it actually came up on the mailing

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
list there was some discussion about it

208
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
we just want to give an opportunity for

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
anyone in the working group

210
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
to speak up if they want to say

211
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
something about this

212
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
and jim gould you're in the queue go

213
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840
ahead please

214
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,039
and jim if you're speaking we're not

215
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,479
hearing you uh you can't hear me

216
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,199
yes we can now oh yeah now good okay

217
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,319
fantastic

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,440
yeah i um i was the one discussing this

219
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
with benjamin and going back and forth

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,039
on this particular item

221
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,240
the specific uh concern was associated

222
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,360
with returning an

223
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
empty auth info to the sponsoring client

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
as an indication that the authentico has

225
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,240
been set

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
the concern there was that it was

227
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,879
inconsistent to the non-sponsoring

228
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,479
client and we specifically did not want

229
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,919
to provide an indication to the

230
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,360
non-sponsoring

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,400
uh client that the the auth info was set

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,440
or unset

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
um so in that scenario the auth info

234
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,639
would not be returned to the

235
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,159
non-sponsoring client

236
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
and in the case of the sponsoring client

237
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
it would return it if it were set and it

238
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
would not return

239
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,360
if it was not set now as far as

240
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
when this particular feature was added

241
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,360
to the draft

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,080
i look back and this was added in zero

243
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
three of the pre-working group

244
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,279
document so this

245
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
particular feature in the exact language

246
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
in the draft has been there since it

247
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
became a working group document

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,080
um so i'm i would hope that the working

249
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,399
group

250
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,440
had has had opportunity to review that

251
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
language

252
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
and that we would be able to have a

253
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,320
consensus position that that feature

254
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
is fine so like i said

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,399
that last message from benjamin was that

256
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
he felt like

257
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
it was a whim on his part or a

258
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
preference

259
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,480
so it's really up to the working group

260
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,839
to determine whether or not there's an

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,399
issue

262
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
from a consensus perspective on that

263
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,120
particular element of the draft

264
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
thank you so james

265
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,279
excuse me so what do you propose as

266
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,000
procedure

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
we can just continue go ahead and

268
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
or do you want to have the working group

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,920
look at it

270
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,200
not again if that's delayed yeah

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
you can't read good okay um my

272
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
preference is to move forward unless

273
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
there's somebody that objects to it

274
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,040
moving forward based on that particular

275
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
uh raised issue from benjamin i believe

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
that it's been since it's been in the

277
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,959
draft

278
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,399
um i haven't heard of any uh concern

279
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,160
related by the working group of that

280
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
particular feature

281
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
and if there's no raised concerns to

282
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,839
have it move forward

283
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
okay i think that

284
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
um we probably should antoine

285
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,519
uh you or i should just you know close

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,200
the loop on this on the mailing list

287
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
just so it's clear

288
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,959
um but i as far as i can tell i think

289
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
the isg is going to go forward

290
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,240
unless we we say something different so

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
um we'll uh we'll make a point of

292
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
responding on the list just to close the

293
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
loop here

294
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
so that there's the historical record um

295
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
has a note that we're moving forward and

296
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
that'll give folks one last chance if

297
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
they want to say something

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,440
now would be the time up until we send

299
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
our note

300
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
and i see in the um chat room

301
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
that roger carney is just indicating

302
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,000
that he supports moving this forward

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,079
so that's good thank you for that plus

304
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
one roger

305
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
okay so with that uh

306
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
moving on let's move into existing work

307
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,240
and in this case we're going to take

308
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
you know hopefully not more than five

309
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
minutes a document to jump into these

310
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
and antoine's going to take over the

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,040
meeting

312
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
i'm going to jump right in first and

313
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
just give my quick report

314
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
on the first document there simple

315
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,120
registration reporting

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
as you have no doubt seen we did uh

317
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,120
publish a new version in time to just

318
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
meet the deadline

319
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
back on the 12th and thank you very much

320
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,000
there's been some excellent comments on

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,040
the list

322
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
and we will continue to take those on

323
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
board and we will get another version

324
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,839
out

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,200
there were some comments that i think

326
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
were substantive enough that we will

327
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,079
revise the document

328
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
and then look to see if there's any

329
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
other substantive comments but ideally

330
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
this document is very close to being

331
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,480
done

332
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
so after addressing the comments that

333
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
we've just gotten i fully expect that we

334
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,279
will

335
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,320
ask for a working group last call on

336
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,760
this document

337
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
and just to be clear about my status i'm

338
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,240
recusing myself from

339
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
from the process of of advancing this

340
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
document

341

and

349
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
that will take us to our next existing

350
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
word document which is the art of

351
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,760
reverse

352
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
search mario do you want us to run your

353
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
slides or do you want to run them

354
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,160
yourself

355
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,399

358
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,760
or

359
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,800
yes okay

360
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
because we have the buttons in here

361
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
both the presentations are very short so

362
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,480
just

363
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,120
a couple of seconds

364
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
we saw jim gold with his hand up why

365
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
don't we let jim gould uh

366
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
jump in here yeah

367
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
hey uh jim um i had

368
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
posted a message on the list related

369
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
about the inclusion of the concrete

370
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
reports in that draft

371
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
um are you planning on removing those

372
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
reports or what are you going to do

373
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,240
about the reports themselves i was my

374
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
feedback was

375
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,839
to include the framework but the

376
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
concrete reports themselves

377
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,079
should be removed

378
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,560
so um so far we've been wanting to put

379
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
them in there right i mean the idea

380
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
originally

381
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,320
was to have to fill up the registry with

382
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,839
both the data elements

383
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
and the initial proposed reports so

384
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,279
uh what i need to do is really to kind

385
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,000
of push on that

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
on the list and see if we can get some

387
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
other discussion about it

388
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
i i think another next step too i'll

389
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,199
offer this

390
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,680
is we were part of the reason for

391
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,279
including the reports is you'll

392
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
uh you might remember this gym

393
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
the report specifications came from a

394
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,959
number of documents

395
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,360
that the icann tech ops group had

396
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
drafted and put together

397
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,639
so i think what i want to do here is

398
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,160
also to expose this document

399
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,399
one more time maybe we'll have a joint

400
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
meeting between regex and techops

401
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,800
as we've done in the past a few times

402
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,639
and put this document in particular on

403
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,680
the agenda

404
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
and have some broader discussion about

405
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,399
whether or not to remove those things

406
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
so i'm i'm hesitant to just say yes i

407
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
take your point

408
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
uh but i think we were we were

409
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
accommodating their existence elsewhere

410
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
and if we take them out of this document

411
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
then they need to come into existence

412
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
somewhere

413
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
and in some way and we need to have that

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
discussion okay

415
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,279
i think that's yes

416
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,199
okay thanks for the question though

417
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
still have a comment james or

418
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,680
no okay

419
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,519
first in the queue i'll key

420
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,839
i'll start the next presentation

421
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,839
which is the search document

422
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,920
okay mario yes

423
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,600
you have to present

424
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
your updates yes

425
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,320
only two slides about uh this draft

426
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
the first uh slide is about the

427
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,199
versions that have been published since

428
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,639
last itf meeting the zero six

429
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,560
version uh the zero six version

430
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
i have i have updated the privacy

431
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,000
consideration

432
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,040
and the security consideration as a

433
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,160
follow-up of the

434
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,600
feedback uh from from the

435
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
last meeting and i added

436
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,839
an appendix about uh the paradigms to

437
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,519
enforce access controls or reverse

438
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,000
search

439
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,320
in unfortunately

440
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
since last itf i am not receiving any

441
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,279
technical feedback i

442
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
i was awful to receive

443
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,000
technical feedback because i guess that

444
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,199
the feedback about privacy

445
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,400
considerations

446
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,799
is now

447
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
over so now i'm

448
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
waiting for uh

449
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,760
any questions or any feedback about

450
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,440
the how to implement technically

451
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,280
this solution

452
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,559
i wonder if there is

453
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
enough interest in this working group in

454
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,280
going in carry on these document

455
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,120
in moving forward this document if

456
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,000
i think that if there will be no

457
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,080
relevant feedback about the

458
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,320
technical solution in the next months

459
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
i am i'm quite convinced to

460
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,280
withdraw the document but at the same

461
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320
time i expect

462
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,840
that in this case

463
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,640
this kind of topic will not be addressed

464
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
for

465
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,600
the the next five years at least

466
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,520
next slide please

467
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,200
the the last slide is to

468
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
to make evident how

469
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
they uh despite what is

470
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,520
is the the interest collected in this

471
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,559
working group

472
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,000
outside this working group the interest

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,280
about such

474
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,480
capability is i because the

475
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,840
european commission start the last step

476
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,600
about the process to enact

477
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,720
a law on

478
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,120
a european common exchange system

479
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,240
with secure channels for the ending

480
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
of the authorized cross-border

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,440
communication

482
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
authentication transmission of data

483
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
access

484
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
requested and that requested between the

485
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
competent authorities

486
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,840
and service providers according to this

487
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
proposal to

488
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
the deadline to comply with rain data

489
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
access about

490
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,840
evidence the so-called evidence should

491
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,880
be

492
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
in emergency cases maximum 16 hours or

493
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
so

494
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,400
and we it is needless

495
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
to say that reverse research

496
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,559
reverse wheeze in particular in the

497
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,879
document is one of the

498
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,760
is maybe the most important

499
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
capabilities supporting a cyber

500
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,120
investigation

501
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
so that's all about

502
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
this draft i would like to invite

503
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,520
everybody to provide technical

504
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
feedback about this document to move the

505
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
document forward

506
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
and to

507
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,440
discuss about

508
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,840
how to implement it in really

509
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,799
implemented

510
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,039

i i have to remind everybody that this

513
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,320
document has been in our queue for a

514
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,280
long time

515
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,000
especially because there was originally

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,880
issues

517
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
from the human rights working group

518
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,399
on especially the uh

519
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
the privacy considerations

520
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
mario has done quite some work on it

521
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,120
but we really need a good proper review

522
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,919
for everybody

523
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,919
that thinks that this document should

524
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,880
move forward so

525
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,679
when mario will propose a review on the

526
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,080
list i propose that everybody will at

527
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,399
least

528
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,640
say they support the documents and

529
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
i'm happy to progress with it mario

530
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,880
then let's see

531
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,400
the next document

532
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,559
let's share the

533
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
chair slides again

534
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,559
all right see where i

535
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,720
was heading

536
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
and perhaps it's also nice for you to

537
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
see my face

538
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,640
the federated authentication for

539
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
registry data access protocol using open

540
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
id scott i don't know if you have any

541
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
things to say about this document or

542
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,600
we're just still waiting for

543
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,280
the application that i can um

544
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,039
sure this is scott hollenbeck the

545
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,559
document was recently updated it was

546
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,320
getting ready to expire so

547
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
i had a couple of minor changes queued

548
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,320
up made those uh mario did give me

549
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
another suggestion for clarification

550
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,480
that i'll

551
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,640
be incorporating into another update you

552
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,080
know when the opportunity presents

553
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
itself

554
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
but yes we really are kind of holding

555
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,400
off on this one to make sure that

556
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,440
for example the set of purposes is

557
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,400
appropriate

558
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,840
for you know use in an icann context

559
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
i mean that's the immediate use case

560
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
that we have of course if anyone knows

561
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
of other use cases that aren't covered

562
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,799
and they know of other purposes that the

563
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
document could include

564
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,679
that would be welcome input as well

565
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,720
yes but for the rest that's the primary

566
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,840
thing we're waiting for right

567
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,200
okay then

568
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,919
moving along to the next one using js

569
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
contact and that's

570
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,480
mario we're going to present that again

571
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
so i'll put up your slides

572
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
here i am again let's see the js contact

573
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,960
slides and here they are

574
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
go ahead mario okay uh

575
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
jump to the next slide please

576
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,360
yes since

577
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,919
last meeting three versions have been

578
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,360
published

579
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
mostly consequent to the

580
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,919
updates to dj's contact specification

581
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,000
a particular update is the

582
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
recommendation of some

583
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
map keys to be used in response

584
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,879
that we can see in the next slide please

585
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,000
so uh since in jazz contest

586
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,600
specification

587
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,159
most of the collections are represented

588
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
as maps

589
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,158
so the authors

590
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,720
made taken this decision because

591
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,799
they are convinced that this kind of

592
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,760
representation is

593
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,320
better uh treatable in with respect to

594
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,360
the arrays

595
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,559
so the the there is the problem

596
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,000
to assign some

597
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
meaningful keys to

598
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,600
some maps representing some

599
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,679
collections in jazz concept so

600
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,320
our idea is to use some well-known

601
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
labels as map keys so

602
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,080
to use the org label to

603
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
to for for the

604
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,159
organization map the internet lock for

605
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,600
the addresses

606
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,840
map and

607
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,360
57 33

608
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,880
to identify

609
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
uh they made some they animate

610
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,919
in the main smart voice in the force map

611
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
and the effects in the force map

612
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,919
so next slide please

613
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,440
just a few words about

614
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,520
the jazz constitutes that i have

615
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,559
i have presented

616
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,799
a an update about this library in

617
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,919
the recent raw

618
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
meeting this is an

619
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,279
open source java library for just

620
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,600
contact creation validation

621
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,159
civilization the civilization

622
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,799
conversation from

623
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,000
and to any dialect

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
of vicar dialect

625
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,279
any picada format 2.js contact from n2js

626
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,760
contact

627
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
and now the last version is compliant

628
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
with

629
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
all the specifications contact

630
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,039
specification

631
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,320
and the a and this

632
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,760
draft in particular so

633
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,679
you you it is able to assign

634
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,279
automatically the the

635
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,960
the the keys

636
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
as described in the previous slide the

637
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,360
two

638
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,000
to the maps without any particular

639
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,559
effort

640
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,960
so if you want to

641
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,720
try to implement these

642
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,880
drafts you can consider this library if

643
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,360
you are

644
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
if you are obviously if you are java

645
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
programmers to

646
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
make it this very easy to implement

647
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,679
the transition between

648
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,279
from card to js contact

649
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,200
next slide please

650
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,360
the next steps are that

651
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,520
to to basically to

652
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,799
add the other implementation to

653
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,240
the proposal there is a a

654
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,840
an ongoing uh implementation by central

655
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
nick

656
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
it is already it has been already done

657
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
but it is not live but

658
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,760
now currently but you it will be

659
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,880
live soon and uh

660
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,120
i i expect that there will be other

661
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
registry

662
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,600
that uh

663
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,320
are wish to implement the draft

664
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,159
if following the the the feedback

665
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,240
from last row uh now the jazz contest

666
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,360
patch is

667
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,159
closed very close to being submitted to

668
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,120
the isg

669
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,320
last real open issue is about how to end

670
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,720
the localization

671
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,120
and probably this will be

672
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
done

673
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,600
through a json patch like

674
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,200
approach i would like to

675
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,960
uh to ensure

676
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,799
a mark that have been

677
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,000
that provided feedback on the mailing

678
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,559
list

679
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,840
about the visibility of this approach

680
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,799
i recently made some tests

681
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,840
by using the the jackson library

682
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,960
uh java jackson library and

683
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,000
i i implemented this approach without

684
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,399
any particular customized customization

685
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,600
so i

686
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,799
it took me one hour to implement

687
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,679
this approach on js contact

688
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
so i think that this is

689
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,880
in this case this seems to be

690
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,120
the the most flexible approach to

691
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,399
provide localization for every uh js

692
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,360
contact

693
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,320
content just contact information next

694
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,039
slide please

695
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,480
and that's all from my side about

696
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,279
this proposal

697
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,840
okay anybody questions for mario

698
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,480
no no questions okay then we will

699
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,520
move on to the list to move this

700
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,480
document alone

701
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,960
then we go back to the tier slides again

702
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,799
and we are on this page next

703
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,080
documents existing work is

704
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,000
the use of internationalized email

705
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,080
addresses in the epp protocol

706
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,799
and i think dmitry isn't here to talk

707
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,760
about it

708
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,039
he did leave some notes back

709
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,600
to i think it was

710
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,559
james was it was it you who

711
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,039
he said

712
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,159
no i can speak to this uh the status of

713
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,120
this draft

714
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,720
yeah if you're ready okay yep uh yeah so

715
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,760
um the first thing there was really

716
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,919
no discussion on the list uh for this

717
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,840
draft so uh dimitri and i

718
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,000
discussed offline one tbd item

719
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,320
that was in the draft which was

720
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,440
associated with

721
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,960
a placeholder email value

722
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,519
an ascii value to deal with really the

723
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,279
transition period

724
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,760
where clients and servers don't fully

725
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,320
support

726
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,360
eai and the the other side of the

727
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,320
connection

728
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
doesn't support it and the particular

729
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,000
email

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,360
element is required and this particular

731
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,000
use case

732
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,559
exists in the contact mapping rfc 5733

733
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,840
where email is required so in the case

734
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
where the only value that exists is an

735
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,720
internationalized email address

736
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,039
and uh the client needs to create the

737
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,120
contact in the server

738
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,399
um what should the client pass

739
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,440
in this scenario are uh in the draft

740
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,840
that specifies the use a placeholder

741
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,320
value that's not a real email address

742
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,080
it's a placeholder and an indication of

743
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
the fact that the only

744
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
email that's available is an

745
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,960
internationalized one and the server

746
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,760
doesn't support

747
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,720
internationalized emails so therefore

748
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,519
this

749
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,399
placeholder value is sent to meet the

750
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,559
needs of the protocol

751
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,399
once the server does in fact support

752
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,480
internationalized email addresses

753
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
then the contact can be updated with an

754
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,760
eai

755
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,039
uh address so what we did was

756
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,760
um well i posted a message to the list

757
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,960
um

758
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
defining the set of requirements for

759
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,080
that placeholder

760
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,039
as well as a proposal and the proposal

761
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,880
was to use the rfc7535empty.as1

762
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,559
domain name which is a black hole domain

763
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,679
and then to add on their eai

764
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,600
at so the whole idea is it's an ascii

765
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,159
email address that is that will not have

766
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,200
any mx records will not go anywhere

767
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,320
but it's needed only when the email is

768
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,919
required by protocol

769
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,600
and the only value available is an

770
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
internationalized email address

771
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,320
so uh pretty much what i'm looking for

772
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,440
from the working group

773
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,119
um is any feedback on that particular

774
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,480
placeholder value

775
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,599
and i believe scott raised a question to

776
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,679
the chairs

777
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,960
to get some outside email expert

778
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,839
advice on this

779
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,079
yes that's correct james the the chairs

780
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
have got a request and

781
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,440
that's also why we are discussing it

782
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
here in the meeting of course because

783
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
this is a placeholder for an email

784
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
address and that

785
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,239
as far as we know it it has not been

786
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,839
used before

787
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,560
so we we have uh host names we have

788
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,399
domain names like example.com

789
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,719
we have specialized uh ip addresses but

790
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,679
uh a

791
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,040
an email address as a place or

792
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,239
holder as far as we are aware uh has not

793
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,200
been defined

794
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
yet so the question do we need to define

795
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,680
first or is this the definition

796
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,359
and we were actually well that's that's

797
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,599
the proposed definition because

798
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,119
if you look at the set of requirements

799
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
that's posted in the one

800
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,599
version of the draft um it needs to be

801
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,480
an ascii

802
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
email that would match uh validation

803
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
requirements for the server

804
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,280
um it also can't be a real email address

805
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
because it's pretty much it's not the

806
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,280
real email address because it's an

807
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,640
internationalized email that

808
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,560
that exists um but it's only needed

809
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,320
like i said is during the transition

810
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,160
period where in this case the server

811
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,040
doesn't support

812
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
internationalized emails and that's the

813
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
only value that exists

814
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
so it's really a corner case but we

815
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,720
can't ignore that case and this is the

816
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
way to get

817
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
through that transition period

818
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,160
okay all right go ahead

819
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,640
yeah james up

820
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,440
i see where this value is you know why

821
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
you would you know

822
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
like to have this but actually in

823
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,640
practice

824
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,320
how useful will this be as a registry

825
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,720
if i require an email address i want a

826
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,800
real email address where i can reach the

827
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
registrar

828
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,079
and i will block this this well-known

829
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,920
value because i don't want it

830
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,119
i want a real one and if if it's not

831
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,920
provided

832
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,760
i will not let the registration go

833
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
through so

834
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,680
i i really don't see how this you know

835
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,480
if the registry requires an email

836
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,320
address which is not an eai

837
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,359
one somebody has to provide it

838
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,680
and i don't think that a placeholder

839
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,599
value will

840
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,079
will help

841
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,960
i'll go ahead can i respond to that yep

842
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
i i ulric i think the right solution of

843
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,560
this is for you to support

844
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,079
internationalized email addresses

845
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,920
therefore it can be really passed

846
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
the only reason why that placeholder is

847
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,960
needed

848
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
is the fact that you signal that you

849
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
don't support it

850
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,400
so if you support it as a server you'll

851
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,839
get a real internet

852
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,359
internationalized email address and

853
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,680
you'll be able to use it

854
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
the only reason why the client has to do

855
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,960
it is that it's

856
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,720
you signal that you don't support

857
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,119
internationalized email addresses

858
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,200
so would you suggest i understand that

859
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,520
but

860
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,560
you see what i'm saying is you're

861
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,400
totally right that i should

862
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
support eai but in the case i don't

863
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,359
i still want to really to be able to

864
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,119
reach the registrant and i can only do

865
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,119
that with a real email address not with

866
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,560
a fake one

867
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,960
and i but the point of that is if the uh

868
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
if the registrant doesn't have

869
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,720
an asking email address and all they

870
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
have is an uh

871
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,000
internationalized one then

872
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
that's the problem for the registrant

873
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,800
because they won't get their

874
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,079
domain so what

875
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,599
the only answer is that you would have

876
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,200
to provide both

877
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
yes until all servers support

878
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
internationalized emails

879
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
right all sorts of all registries where

880
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,760
i would like to register a domain yes

881
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,280
right so there's no transition period

882
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,200
well i mean not for the registry

883
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,960
because the registry either supports it

884
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
or doesn't support it

885
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,520
but i i mean for example in dot se i

886
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
actually have the legal requirement to

887
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,880
have an email address

888
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,920
where i can reach the registrant so i

889
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
i can't therefore legally i cannot

890
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,000
support internationalized email

891
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
addresses

892
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,680
in the end yeah if you i agree in the

893
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,240
end

894
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,839
but before that so i

895
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,440
what i see is for the transition period

896
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,079
the regular trend needs to have two

897
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,200
addresses

898
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,280
not the registry needs to support some

899
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,079
fake value okay

900
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,240
i think i think we need to um

901
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,640
uh just get ahold of this conversation i

902
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
understand what's going on here

903
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,240
let me um offer offer the following um

904
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,920
they are there we are crossing a

905
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
boundary here with

906
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,000
respect to a policy concern versus a

907
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
technical concern

908
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,240
um and there are as a as a policy matter

909
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,880
uh the email address may have to have

910
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,440
certain

911
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,000
certain characteristics among them being

912
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
that it has to actually work

913
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,960
um i see that as a as a as a policy

914
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,680
issue

915
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,359
not as a technical issue so i i still

916
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,119
and and i know in a private conversation

917
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,200
james you and i had uh jim gold you and

918
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,640
i had had had a

919
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,440
little small interaction about this

920
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,560
issue

921
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,920
i think there are two things that have

922
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,480
to happen at this point one is we should

923
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,520
actually get

924
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,920
uh some comments from the email

925
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,960
community

926
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
and we do have some advice uh from

927
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,280
from the uh from our ads about a way to

928
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,319
go do that

929
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,800
and uh the chairs will take that on as

930
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,680
an action

931
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,160
to make this document visible to an

932
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,599
appropriate set of people to get a

933
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,680
reaction from the email community

934
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,400
about the use of a placeholder email

935
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,880
address

936
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,880
in this way um on the issue of the

937
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,079
of the policy concern i'm

938
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,560
you know i i i guess i'm not sure where

939
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
to go with that right now and i think

940
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,599
that we need to take that discussion to

941
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,800
the mailing list

942
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,960
one thing that i would suggest about it

943
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,280
all is it might be interesting

944
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,560
if we move forward in a joint meeting

945
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,640
with the icann tech ops group

946
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,800
uh in part because we need to talk about

947
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
the registration reporting

948
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,079
it has occurred to me that we could add

949
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,880
this issue as a discussion point there

950
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,040
just to get some interesting uh

951
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,000
viewpoints from

952
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,480
other registrars and other registries

953
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,000
that might be present there

954
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
and i think that that will also inform

955
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,079
this discussion about what to do going

956
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,040
forward

957
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,240
we're not going to make the decision

958
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,040
here uh i do think it's a valid question

959
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,000
and it's an important one and we should

960
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,720
should follow

961
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,119
each of those paths separately and and

962
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,640
get some more information

963
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
and then we'll uh see what we can do on

964
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,319
the mailing list to make a decision here

965
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,680
that's what i would suggest at this

966
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,520
point uh

967
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,240
anyone want to react to that as a very

968
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,760
bad idea or

969
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,839
indicate that that's a good idea maybe

970
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,839
even

971
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,119
go ahead

972
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,440
that we can continue down this path as i

973
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,960
put the proposal out there

974
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,040
hopefully uh those can respond to that

975
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,119
thread and we can continue to discuss on

976
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,040
the list

977
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,960
yes very much welcome that jim you're

978
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,040
exactly right let's move the discussion

979
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,680
there

980
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
uh there's clearly some some issues to

981
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
be to be walked through

982
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,040
so okay yes all right thank you sorry

983
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,960
about thank you

984
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
yeah taking it to the list for further

985
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,240
discussion thank you jim

986
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,599
for your suggestions um

987
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,319
moving along to the next document which

988
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,480
is still existing work is the

989
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,079
rfc 7484 biz document

990
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,359
um and that has been in

991
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,040
working with last call it has been

992
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,520
closed and it will be submitted

993
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,640
to the isg isg

994
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,000
soon as well um

995
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,560
it's actually waiting for a revised

996
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,119
document

997
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,960
that's the issue at the moment yeah yes

998
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,640
now i remember it passed working with

999
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,359
glasgow

1000
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,359
but it still needs a new version of the

1001
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,280
document before we can submit it to

1002
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,800
submit it to the isg

1003
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,880
so this is really a call on mark

1004
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,240
blanchet i think

1005
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,640
it's holiday season so that might be a

1006
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,520
reason

1007
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,960
uh we're waiting for the next uh

1008
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,040
revision and then we'll submit this one

1009
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,480
to the iesg

1010
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,400
and then that means it's done for the

1011
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,160
standardization work of the art app

1012
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,760
service right okay

1013
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,359
then that was the existing work now

1014
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,480
new work and request for adoption and

1015

1031
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,400
microphone there

1032
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,280
yeah because jody as soon as you start

talking and say can anybody hear you

1034
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,119
that's what we hear and after that

1035
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,720
there's nothing so

1036
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,280
we'll move to uh we'll move to early

1037
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,560
first uh

1038
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,520
we'll have a presentation on the uh

1039
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,280
registered lock extension

1040
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
and your ulri do you want to control the

1041
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,200
slides yourself

1042
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
oh if you control the slice that's

1043
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,640
totally okay i think it's um

1044
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,078
yeah it's okay not so many then let's

1045
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,280
yeah so then yes so registry lock

1046
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,520
automation and next slide please

1047
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,800
so um a small problem description is

1048
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,119
uh what you see here is basically the

1049
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,400
flow of

1050
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,720
somebody registering your domain you are

1051
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,839
a customer you go to a reseller

1052
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,000
orchestra

1053
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,319
we try to register domain and the whole

1054
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,720
flow to the registry and back is fully

1055
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
automated

1056
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,440
and so the next slide please that is a

1057
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,200
short description of the problem

1058
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,480
hackers so because if somebody hacks

1059
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,960
into this process they can do whatever

1060
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,319
they want with your domain

1061
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,359
and the next slide please

1062
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,480
so what uh registry lock tries to do

1063
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,520
and i i realized that there is a lot of

1064
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,440
names for this it's registry log and

1065
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,240
registrar log and registrant block and

1066
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,800
you know all of this if you want to have

1067
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,960
a really good overview about all the

1068
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,319
different types of it

1069
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,240
the center has done a working group

1070
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,040
and they have had a real good document

1071
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,440
about

1072
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,520
all the different types of blocking that

1073
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,720
are out there and

1074
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,400
how they work but what they all have in

1075
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
common is that

1076
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,359
they want to stop the automated changes

1077
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,200
to domain names

1078
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,200
and um so somewhere in the process there

1079
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,280
needs to be a manual

1080
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,119
human step before and a change can go

1081
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,000
through

1082
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and it can be the right customer it can

1083
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,319
be the registrar it can be the registry

1084
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,839
but somebody has to do something and so

1085
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,599
now you're wondering didn't i say

1086
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,920
registry log automation in the beginning

1087
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,440
and yes that is definitely true

1088
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,800
so what we try to automate is not the

1089
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,400
full registry log but we try to automate

1090
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,440
the locking not the unlocking okay

1091
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,240
next step the next slide please yes so

1092
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,720
there's

1093
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,000
a document uh in in the tracker

1094
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,040
and next slide please

1095
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,960
so what the doc what the the draft says

1096
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,319
is that you can chain that the registry

1097
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,880
log

1098
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,960
once the domain is logged prevents any

1099
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,280
changes to the registration data here so

1100
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,839
update commands are rejected delete and

1101
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,680
transfer to mark

1102
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,079
are rejected but renew is still possible

1103
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,440
so next slide please and um

1104
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,000
so domains can then be locked with a

1105
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
simple

1106
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,760
lock command either when they're created

1107
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,200
or through an update command later on

1108
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,640
and and obviously there's no unlock

1109
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,599
because that has to be out of band and

1110
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,000
next slide please

1111
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,680
so the

1112
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,720
i i i rejected some of the the epp stuff

1113
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,000
here that needs to be in a create

1114
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,960
command but

1115
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,880
but you basically see the extension and

1116
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,079
it says block

1117
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,800
and that's it it has only one command no

1118
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,680
data in it

1119
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,640
and the domain is locked and the next

1120
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,960
slide please

1121
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,720
so um then what the

1122
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,640
extension allows is two types of

1123
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,920
unlocking

1124
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,200
and so

1125
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,760
one is permanently unlocking so the

1126
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,359
domain is locked the domain is unlocked

1127
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,040
and it's basically the state that all

1128
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,720
domains are in today

1129
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,680
and but the temporary unlocking is that

1130
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,960
you have like say

1131
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,359
oh i want to make a change to the domain

1132
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,520
but then i want it to be locked again

1133
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,400
and so you you unlock the domain for a

1134
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,119
period

1135
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,359
of time let's say half an hour or

1136
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,240
something

1137
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,280
and it also allows you to say

1138
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,240
i unlock the domain for three epp

1139
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,640
commands something like this so um

1140
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,879
yes

1141
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,599
yes and obviously for all of them for

1142
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,000
all changes to go through there is an

1143
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,119
out-of-band authorization required and i

1144
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,280
looked into this how we could do this in

1145
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,839
band but i really didn't see anything

1146
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:56,720
how we can

1147
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,000
securely connect and a digital signature

1148
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,119
to an epp command so that's why there's

1149
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,359
only out of band and next slide please

1150
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,319
yes so then when when you temporarily

1151
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:10,800
unlock

1152
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,559
the domain um so this would be the the

1153
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,200
answer for

1154
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,079
for an unlocked domain so the domain is

1155
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,119
permanently unlocked

1156
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,960
and then next slide please we have the

1157
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,160
locked domain it says lock one or true

1158
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,720
it's a

1159
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,200
boolean value so um and next slide

1160
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,800
please

1161
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,040
and this is one that is temporarily

1162
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,240
unlocked with

1163
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,280
an assessor one epp command and

1164
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,720
to this point until this point in time

1165
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,599
it will be unlocked yeah and the next

1166
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,079
slide please

1167
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,280
so uh there is a few things that

1168
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,319
need to be discussed in the in this and

1169
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,359
that i don't have

1170
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,400
really good answers to yet um

1171
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,960
so what happens to subordinate hosts are

1172
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,240
they locked automatically too

1173
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,520
what happens to connected contacts i

1174
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,920
i mean if you lock your domain but i can

1175
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,200
still change the

1176
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,720
the registrant contact that seems to be

1177
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,480
a security risk

1178
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,599
um but then again this

1179
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:23,200
is policy so um

1180
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,640
uh but i think we should say something

1181
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,920
about this because if

1182
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,079
the policy is very too much it will be

1183
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,000
really hard for registrars to implement

1184
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,960
this

1185
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,800
and so must registries support the epp

1186
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,760
command count

1187
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,680
or what do they do if they don't support

1188
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,960
it so

1189
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,839
um and how are domains secured i mean if

1190
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,040
if your domain is locked but the name

1191
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,720
servers for the domain are not blocked

1192
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
then i can point them to

1193
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,400
new ip addresses would this be a problem

1194
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,559
uh how should we handle this uh or

1195
00:51:58,559 --> 00:51:59,440
should we just

1196
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,280
you know put in some text that says oh

1197
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,559
look at this too

1198
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,720
and um yes

1199
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,240
this is the questions that i would

1200
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,160
really like you know some people to

1201
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,079
you know come back with them you know

1202
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,000
input how they would handle it or how

1203
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,640
they would

1204
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,680
it like to be handled and

1205
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,040
yeah and i think that was my last slide

1206
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,640
thank you um before we go to people in

1207
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,480
the queue we have a

1208
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,359
little time left for jody to uh to have

1209
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,000
his talk

1210
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,800
if his microphone works so what is my

1211
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,079
question to you always what is your

1212
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,839
intention for this document

1213
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,000
are you asking for adoption or first ask

1214
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,680
ask for feedback

1215
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,640
uh i would ask for adoption and feedback

1216
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
so because i think we should work on

1217
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,640
this i i you know there needs to be some

1218
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,920
response from the community but

1219
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,559
i think basically the the the basic

1220
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,800
process is very easy and

1221
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,079
unsettled but i think uh some of the

1222
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,119
the the policy stuff around this

1223
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,559
needs to be discussed somewhere and uh

1224
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,480
yeah we need to find a way to do this

1225
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,640
so let's do that on the main list i will

1226
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,400
close the queue but the two people over

1227
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
in the queue can still

1228
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
do have their questions so alexander

1229
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
your first

1230
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,920
thank you alexander mayor from eighty

1231
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,960
um on the questions i think you listed a

1232
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,800
really hard questions already and i

1233
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,960
think those questions are indeed

1234
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,240
pretty much policy so

1235
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,079
they shouldn't be the epp extension i

1236
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,440
think uh

1237
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,880
on the other hand the information that's

1238
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,559
conveyed in the epp extension is

1239
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,359
connected to the policy of course

1240
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,839
so it's a hard problem but but what i

1241
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:46,640
can offer

1242
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,000
as as you probably know we are

1243
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,559
implementing some form of registry lock

1244
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,480
or i think it's called registrar in our

1245
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,200
case

1246
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,040
um at the moment so i can come back to

1247
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,559
you and answer those questions that you

1248
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,440
have there

1249
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,440
uh with with our ideas

1250
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,520
we we get away without an epp and

1251
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,480
because we understood that

1252
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,400
the only purpose of dpp extension is

1253
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,040
switching the registrar log

1254
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,880
on um then it's a very a very narrow

1255
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,119
part of the business process that

1256
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,640
probably only works well as soon as

1257
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,240
there are other registries

1258
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,119
also using an epp extension yeah get the

1259
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,079
point

1260
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,920
if do you um do you uh

1261
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,960
support the adoption

1262
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,599
alexander

1263
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,760
yeah um

1264
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,400
i think i would support adoption

1265
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,799
in the near future yeah if that makes

1266
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:49,680
sense

1267
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,359
because i see more and more registries

1268
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,359
implementing um

1269
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,480
registry lock or register lock and so

1270
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,400
uh in the near future there will be more

1271
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,280
people be able to comment on the split

1272
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,040
between policy and so on and so forth

1273
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,599
and

1274
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,559
the subway tell us we can keep it in our

1275
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,640
backyard

1276
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,079
on the mailing list yeah

1277
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,760
and then richard the last question for

1278
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,960
you

1279
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,480
get my preferences there uh thanks um

1280
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,119
real real briefly rick wilhelm verasan

1281
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:27,599
uh

1282
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,839
i think so registry lock i think that

1283
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,280
there's a lot of general agreement that

1284
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,960
it's a good thing um however

1285
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,599
i don't think i think that we should

1286
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,280
look long and hard about

1287
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,319
enabling registry lock via

1288
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,520
epp because it's a mechanism that

1289
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,440
actually helps protect against the

1290
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,160
the registrar's epp channel being

1291
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,280
compromised

1292
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,480
and so even the notion of locking it

1293
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,760
over epp is something that can

1294
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,799
lead to inadvertent consequences for

1295
00:55:58,799 --> 00:55:59,599
example

1296
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,960
if a a bad actor

1297
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,000
changes name servers and then also goes

1298
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,960
in and subsequently

1299
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,400
locks the name uh that can

1300
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,799
lead to unintended consequences

1301
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,559
essentially a denial of service because

1302
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:15,119
it

1303
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,520
makes it more difficult for the

1304
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,760
legitimate registrant registrar

1305
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,720
to flip things back so overall the

1306
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,599
notion of

1307
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,680
registry lock being an out of band thing

1308
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,280
and outside of epp

1309
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,240
is actually a feature rather than a bug

1310
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,280
so i think we should

1311
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,839
think hard before looking at

1312
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,680
standardizing a way to do it

1313
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,240
over uh epp thank you

1314
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,480
thank you appreciate

1315
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,480
and thank you ulri for your presentation

1316
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,920
so we're looking forward to the

1317
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,240
questions on the mailing list

1318
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,680
and the request for adoption

1319
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,559
and then we will

1320
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,680
go back to see if jody is still

1321
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,280
alive and he is back with his audio

1322
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,880
yes we can hear you can you still hear

1323
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,200
me

1324
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,280
test test one now we can still hear you

1325
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,040
yes thank you

1326
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,480
all right very sorry about that guys

1327
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,240
i'll i'll be quick um

1328
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,280
this uh this

1329
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,480
what we're requesting is a way to redact

1330
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,119
our dap fields because of various

1331
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:27,839
privacy

1332
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,839
privacy policies that have been enacted

1333
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,280
by several countries

1334
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,040
certain contact values can no longer be

1335
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,359
returned in rdap responses based on a

1336
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,119
client's privileges

1337
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,440
for example the contact name address

1338
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,119
email phone number is now returned for

1339
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,119
contacts of certain countries for domain

1340
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,880
registrations

1341
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,040
now because of that some of the

1342
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,839
i'm sorry some of the rdap clients have

1343
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:52,400
asked

1344
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,720
well how can we tell since since nothing

1345
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,000
is returned for those

1346
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,480
for those fields um how can they tell if

1347
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,839
there was actual

1348
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,720
field value that was entered or if the

1349
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,400
registrant just did not enter any

1350
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
information

1351
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,760
because of that we've discussed putting

1352
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,079
in values of redacted or redacted due to

1353
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,640
government or privacy policies etc

1354
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,079
into each of these fields in order to

1355
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,599
signal that the actual value was

1356
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,280
redacted due to policy

1357
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,799
but doing that would break the expected

1358
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,240
format of some of these fields for

1359
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,280
example the email

1360
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,880
and phone fields would not be formatted

1361
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,799
as an email or phone number correctly

1362
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,559
and that would lead to could lead to

1363
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,960
issues with rdap client parsing

1364
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,559
so in order to address some of these

1365
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,000
issues the solution

1366
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,839
this solution would allow fields to be

1367
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,240
blank thereby not breaking any type of

1368
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,359
format parsing

1369
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,040
the solution is to create an rdap

1370
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,880
extension that would identify the

1371
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,040
redacted rdap response fields

1372
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,960
using a json path as a default

1373
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,079
expression language

1374
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,760
this would then allow requesters to be

1375
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,119
able to differentiate

1376
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,000
between a field being null because

1377
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,680
because a registrant did not enter any

1378
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,640
information

1379
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,880
or if the field was null because it was

1380
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,920
redacted

1381
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,280
um i know we've only got a couple

1382
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,200
minutes here so i'll just

1383
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,079
stop there and and because of this there

1384
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:04,880
has been quite

1385
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
quite a number of uh interests or quite

1386
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,480
an amount of interest on the

1387
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,480
mailing list so that's why we're

1388
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,599
requesting adoption

1389
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,000
thanks

1390
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,640
okay thank you

1391
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,240
and we have at least a question from

1392
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,399
wilhelm go ahead we'll reset

1393
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,240
ah that was you were still in the queue

1394
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,440
with your hand up okay

1395
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,799
i have a question though jody um

1396
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,839
my question is so all the policy around

1397
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,599
this has already been discussed within

1398
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,240
icann right

1399
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,040
yes most of it has been has been

1400
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,079
discussed

1401
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,599
um i i i'm gonna lean on roger

1402
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,680
a little bit on here but but i think

1403
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,720
we've decided that

1404
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,240
yes that this is the way that it should

1405
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,079
be uh

1406
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,839
roger would would you agree with that

1407
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,799
the the only question i really have is

1408
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,160
you know if the

1409
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,200
uh if the redacted response

1410
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,839
would be a policy decision

1411
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,400
um i i'm not sure i understand the

1412
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,480
question on time

1413
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,880
suppose i'm not i'm i'm a registry but

1414
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,720
i'm not an icann

1415
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,160
i'm another like n registry and i my

1416
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,480
local policy would be that i don't want

1417
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,319
anybody to know whether or not a field

1418
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:32,799
is

1419
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,599
redacted or not so it would be an

1420
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,920
optional

1421
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,119
extension right yes absolutely

1422
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,680
i i don't see this as an extension that

1423
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,240
every

1424
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,440
registry would would

1425
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,520
would be required to implement yeah

1426
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,000
exactly

1427
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,480
okay richard was in and out of queue

1428
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,359
again and

1429
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,599
jim is in the queue so i'll go over to

1430
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,160
jim first

1431
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,079
thank you um let me offer a comment

1432
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,160
um not wearing uh any hats here just so

1433
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,119
just speaking

1434
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,440
personally i i support adoption of this

1435
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,319
document

1436
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,559
and more generally i think that

1437
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,280
there is a need in our dap to be able to

1438
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,839
return one of three states

1439
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,839
it's not just about whether data is

1440
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,119
present or not

1441
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,440
you need to indicate there needs to be a

1442
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,680
way in the response to indicate that

1443
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,799
there is data

1444
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,359
but you can't have it and that's really

1445
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,799
all that's going on here

1446
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,960
it's just an extension that gives you

1447
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,559
the opportunity

1448
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,319
as a responder as a server

1449
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,240
to be able to give a client more

1450
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,000
information and give them

1451
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
that data point that there is data but

1452
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,920
i'm not going to give it to you

1453
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,039
and it is needed by a variety of

1454
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,000
policies um so it really is an

1455
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,599
implementation issue

1456
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,640
it's just adding another feature to rdap

1457
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,400
that's not there but it's not required

1458
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,760
obviously whether or not

1459
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,960
one uses it and how you use it is uh

1460
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,240
you know completely a policy decision

1461
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,280
and a matter of local implementation so

1462
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,839
i just wanted to offer that out there

1463
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,839
uh here on the on the list thank you

1464
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,160
okay thank you jim and thank you jody

1465
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,200
and that was our last

1466
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,400
presentation for today

1467
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,839
jody looking forward to

1468
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,160
the discussion and the adoption request

1469
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,119
on the mailing list

1470
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,839
and then we're happy to move that along

1471
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,440
and for that i think this oh

1472
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,880
you wanted to say something jody

1473
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,119
i guess not it's button choosing time

1474
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,039
right

1475
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:05,760
okay if there is no any other business

1476
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,160
then

1477
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,000
we are three minutes late in this

1478
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,920
shorter meeting um

1479
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,960
i hope that next time when everybody uh

1480
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,319
is preparing for the meeting uh please

1481
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,680
give us a heads up in time

1482
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,240
for us to judge the agenda time that we

1483
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,039
need

1484
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,440
we just made it three minutes over time

1485
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,400
now

1486
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,720
if there's no other any other business

1487
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,038
then

1488
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,400
this will be meeting adjourned and thank

1489
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,520
you

1490
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:45,839
for taking diminished research

1491
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,200
antoine um you can hear me right

1492
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,359
so i can i can hear you can you hear me

1493
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:41,200
yes i do trying to get the minutes

1494
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,880
i did get a copy of them i grabbed them

1495
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
okay you already have a copy of god

1496
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,799
yeah i just went i figured that you were

1497
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,160
probably doing that too i was hearing

1498
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,200
some typing so

1499
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,799
yeah just wanted to let you know that i

1500
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,480
got them i'm sure they rickle

1501
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,599
i don't know if you'll send them to us

1502
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,599
or not but it's okay i did

1503
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,319
did grab a copy so we'll uh we can put

1504
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,520
that together actually i don't think we

1505
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,839
have to post anything since they're in

1506
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,119
the note md the code md do we uh

1507
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,119
i think we still have to post them to

1508
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,680
the data tracker

1509
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,880
okay not a problem um we'll trim those

1510
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,359
up

1511
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,520
and uh get them get them over there so

1512
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,039
i'll take care of that okay

1513
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,559

1517
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,440
